Mirror writer Nia Dalton spent a day shadowing Somerset farmer Josh Gay to see what he gets up to in 24 hours - from herding sheep to weighing cattle and eating with the seasons

Driving through the country lanes of Somerset, I've never felt more like a city girl. My car struggles to get up the narrow, muddy hills and my nose quickly adapts to the strong smell of manure at 8am. It's a world away from my comfort zone at a desk but I'm excited to take it in - cow poo and all.

As soon as I come face-to-face with farmer Josh Gay, he takes one look at my ankle wellies and gold hooped earrings and laughs, so I have a sneaky suspicion I'm not going to be cut out for farm life. Still, I'm here to learn what it's like to live as a modern-day farmer, and Josh is just that.

At 28-years-old, he is already running the family business at Newton Farm, and he's passionate about regenerative agriculture and embracing new ways of working. His team of four are all between the ages of 16 and 30, representing a new generation of farmers in a career that typically lacks interest from teens.

""It's harder to attract new people into the industry because we can't match wages that supermarkets can - especially if they're unskilled,"" Josh explains to me. Josh is the fourth generation of the Gay family to proudly run the mixed farm, following in the footsteps of his parents, Hugh and Celia - and his passion is infectious.

""I always wanted to be a cowboy when I was younger. Then when I turned 16, my parents asked me if I wanted to take over the farm one day,"" he says, giving me a tour of the barn. As we get up close and personal with the cows, Josh tells me they're his favourite animal because ""they all have personalities"" - and I can see what he means.

While I'm enjoying meeting a sow that's about to give birth to piglets, it quickly becomes apparent that we've got a lot of work to do. There's a frozen pipe, broken machinery and fences that need building at the farm shop, so we grab a chainsaw and ear defenders and climb into his tractor.

""I've knocked myself out before and put a chainsaw through my foot - but I've still got all 10 toes. Dad only has nine,"" Josh tells me, revving up the power tool. Looking down at my frozen feet, I'm hopeful that I'll return home with a full set today - though we've got a while to go.

At this time of year, Josh tends to work 8am to 6pm, and wakes up at 4:30am once a week to go to the abattoir. During lambing season, which is his favourite time of year, he can work as long as 5am to 11pm, and recalls once falling asleep in the hay. But when he does make it home in time for tea, he'll shower and join the rest of the nation watching Love Island - how could he not with farmer Will on the show?

As the morning passes, it becomes apparent that I'm not cut out for lifting logs, but I'm more than capable of tidying the barn, so he hands me a broom. Josh tells me that ""every single day is different"" and there's always a new skill to learn - which is so important for the future of farming.

""Farmers need to be able to adapt as things evolve. It's easy to stay in the past but you always have to move forward with the times,"" he explains. ""It's a lot more scientific than people realise - not just growing crops but rearing animals. We look at energy within the food composition, dry matter, soil health and micronutrients. It's really not just shovelling in a field.""

Talking about modern engineering, Josh tells me: ""There's lots of robots that will do picking, feeding and milking and I do think there's a place for them in farming. ""Robots solve a labour crisis but there's always things you can't do with a machine, so it's better to not rely on them."" While there's no robots at Newton Farm, Josh does have workers Liam, Tom and Paige who make up the extra members of the Gay family.

Around midday, I'm tasked with herding sheep from one field to another, which sounds like an easy task but proves to be otherwise. Stella the sheepdog is still in training and she's not much use - but then again, neither am I.

Walking at a fast pace and shaking a bag of dry food, I shout out ""come on, let's get moving"" to the sheep. They stare back at me quizzically and find every excuse to go AWOL, cheekily escaping down lanes and refusing to follow me in an orderly fashion. But we finally get them where they're meant to be, and I get rewarded with a lunch at the farm shop - a part of the day I could definitely get used to.

""It's very important to eat local. The UK is only 60 percent food efficient, meaning if we were to lose all our imports, we'd be out of food by August,"" Josh says. ""It's even more important to eat seasonally and stop expecting farmers to have strawberries and avocados all year round when they're not available. Right now, purple sprouting broccoli, carrots, lettuce, squashes and pumpkins are all seasonal.""

Josh explains that the farm is insecticide-free and they produce their own fertiliser - which all helps towards a sustainable future. Talking about a disconnect between food and farms, he tells me that we should all have to study agriculture in school like students in New Zealand do.

In the afternoon, we head back to the barn to weigh the calves and check they are all healthy, and I find myself stuck in the middle of the pen with no way out. ""You're not scared of cows, are you?"" Josh shouts over the constant mooing - if I wasn't before, I could be now.

When our final task is complete, I've racked up nearly 30,000 steps and I'm absolutely shattered. Though looking out at the sunset across the farm, I feel accomplished. Before I get into my car, I have one last question for Josh - and I'm almost certain his answer is going to be 'no'.

""You could definitely be a farmer. You showed the right willingness to get stuck in and you weren't afraid of much,"" he says. ""Every farmer needs to have grit, good work ethic and drive. Looking after the livestock is really important and has to be a priority too."" Despite his enthusiasm, I drive back down the country roads feeling a tad thankful that I won't have to put my wellies back on the following morning - but it sure was a lot of fun.

Francesca and Mick Russell argue there is no shortage of fresh produce being grown and blame supermarket giants for refusing to budge on price

A couple who started farming with just one cow and £100 are urging shoppers to ditch 'greedy' supermarkets and buy from traditional greengrocers instead.

Shelves in supermarkets have been emptying for weeks due to a shortage of staples like tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuces.

Some supermarket giants, who say the problems have been caused by the unusually cold weather in Spain and Morocco, have even been rationing the number of items customers can buy to help combat the shortages.

But British farmers Francesca and Mick Russell argue that there is no shortage of fresh produce being grown and blame the retailers for refusing to budge on price.

The couple, who have run Old Oak Farm in Neston, Cheshire, for 13 years, are now urging people to ditch shopping at supermarkets and instead buy fresh fruit and veg from local shops.

Francesca, 42, said: ""You can't just pinpoint one thing for the vegetable crisis, it happens a lot.

""The government isn't helping things with price increases. They're not helping things for farmers.

""There are no British growers and there's not enough support for British growers.

""The lack of pickers, the lack of lovely weather, the money to heat greenhouses. Spain has been cold, and Africa has been cold, it's all different factors.

""The supermarkets set the prices. Abroad the prices are flexible, over here the prices are fixed.

""I saw a supermarket selling bags of carrots for 35p when we were on our knees. We couldn't grow them for that.

""The only way for a lot of farmers not to lose money is to not plant certain things in the first place.

""Most farmers keep having to play along with the supermarket to pay the bank back.""

The mum-of-two encourages shoppers to use their local greengrocer and farm shops instead, arguing the quality is much better.

But she fears for the future of farming.

""Farm shops aren't more expensive necessarily, the other day our broccoli was cheaper than Aldi per kilo,"" she said.

""It's so important to seek out your local farm shop and help your local people.

""We get up at the crack of dawn to do this. Everything we buy is class one to make sure it all tastes lovely.

""We get our honey from our friend. We buy coffee that has been locally blended, I know coffee itself isn't locally sourced.

""We grow loads of things. I had turnips in over the weekend when you couldn't lay your hands on any in the supermarkets.

""We sell out of our eggs every day, we sell out of beef when we have it. We get what we need.

""Supermarkets need to look after the farmers. It feels like this country is trying to get rid of British farming.

""It's so scary because what if we have to import everything.""

Her husband Mick also thinks consumers need to change their shopping habits to support local producers.

They're first-generation farmers who started out with a little pocket of land and £100 spare to start growing produce and rearing animals.

""We bought some cows and then went from there. It's been going on baby steps,"" the 40-year-old explained.

""If you shop locally you support more than one person - we have that many local people who supply us.

""In season we will have 40 local products, apart from bananas and avocados, it's all from as close as we can get to our door.""

He has noticed an increase in demand from his farm in recent times since lockdown - when there were also shortages.

""I've noticed I'm getting text messages from people saying can you save me tomatoes etcetera,"" he said.

""There's definitely been more footfall, it's been on fire for the last month.

""The customers are always so lovely, it's been a really gift. It's not about the money, it's about the job.

""I read somewhere that when you shop locally, 75 per cent goes back into the economy.

""Supermarkets were told last year the prices were going to increase and they essentially said 'we're not going to pay it'.

""There's a lot of veg out there, but the British supermarkets refuse to pay more than the contracted price which is why we can still get hold of stuff and they can't.

""If we want it we have to pay more for it, but the supermarkets refuse to do that. That's the supermarket's problem.

""If we can get hold of the tomatoes, they can. They are not willing to pay the extra price.""

The Mirror has approached Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and the British Retail Consortium (BRC) to see if they wish to respond.

Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC, said: ""Retailers have long established relationships with the farmers in the UK and beyond, and they understand they need to pay a sustainable price for these goods.

""During winter, retailers source much of their summer produce, like tomatoes and lettuces, from countries like Spain and Morocco, where the good weather allows them to grow all year round without the added cost of heating greenhouses.

""This, in turn, allows supermarkets to offer their customers the best value for money at a time when the cost of living has risen sharply.""

Jimmy Doherty, a television star and childhood friend of celeb chef Jamie Oliver, has called on the Government to help tackle the serious mental health crisis brewing among farmers

Telly star Jimmy Doherty has called for urgent Government action to tackle farming's ­soaring stress and suicide rate.

Most farmers say mental health is the biggest hidden issue they face - and shockingly, 36 in England and Wales took their own lives in 2021.

Jimmy, 47, who presents Channel 4 show Jimmy's Farm, said he is not surprised men and women working in agriculture are feeling the strain as costs rocket and subsidies are slashed.

He said: ""Everything has gone up - our business has had to pay an extra £100,000 this year alone to cover costs, and that's a real pressure farmers are facing up and down the country.""

Jimmy, a childhood pal of celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, added: ""We only speak about the importance of our farmers when there is a war.

""But what we forget is farming is the cornerstone of our civilisation and for the Government not to realise that is at its own peril."" The pressures driving farmers to despair include the price of fertiliser rocketing by 134% last year, according to the UK's largest agricultural buying group, AF.

The cost of red ­diesel for farm vehicles is up 43%. And the Govern-ment's Basic Payment Scheme, offering yearly grants to support rural landowners, is being reduced. Farmers borrowing £30,000 have seen payments slashed by 5%, with further cuts on larger sums.

Tory MP Alicia Kearns said: ""It is our farmers who are most under-appreciated and under-discussed.

""They are the agricultural backbone of our nation and they are under a tremendous amount of pressure.""

Among those feeling the pressure is Matt Bradley, a cattle farmer based near Richmond, North Yorks.

The 50-year-old has worked the same land for 25 years.

But spiralling costs have hit the business hard and Matt is now grappling with severe anxiety. His partner Sarah Knowlson, 52, said: ""Our electricity bill has doubled in the last quarter and the situation is killing Matt.

""He suffers really badly with depression and anxiety, and at the moment he's hitting rock bottom. Matt can't afford to work but he can't afford not to work. We're really worried that the farm will collapse.""

According to the Farm Safety Foundation, 94% of farmers say mental health is the biggest hidden issue they face - up from 84% in 2019.

A National Farmers Union poll also found almost one in six pig ­producers have quit the industry in the past six months. And a third of arable farmers ­plan to reduce crops next season.

Stephanie Berkeley, manager of the Farm Safety Foundation, said: ""Urgent action is needed because the impact spiralling costs are having on farmers and their businesses is heartbreaking.

""Farmers are dying to put food on our plates - they're dying to feed us.""

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was contacted for comment.

A Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) is to be held to examine the circumstances around Derek Roan's death, after the farmer was killed by one of his own cows on his family farm last year

A farmer who appeared in a BBC documentary series about the farming industry has been killed by one of his own cows.

Derek Roan, 71, starred on BBC Two show This Farming Life, which follows the struggles and triumphs of very different farming families in beautiful and remote landscapes.

The farmer died in hospital after a horrific incident involving livestock at his family farm near Dalbeattie, Dumfries and Galloway, in June last year.

Emergency services were called to the farm on June 19 and Derek was quickly rushed from Barnbarroch Farm to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary, but nothing could be done to save the grandad-of-six.

His death is now being investigated to determine what exactly happened and caused Derek's death.

A Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) is to be held to examine the circumstances around the farmer's tragic passing, it's been reported.

Derek's family paid tribute to the late family last year, as they released an official statement via their farm firm, Roan's Dairy.

They said: ""We are totally devastated and still in shock at what has happened and it will take some time for us to come to terms of not having him around.

""All Derek's hard work was for his two passions in life - his family and his farms.

""Derek was well known within the farming community and many other circles. He will be sadly missed by all.""

The website for Roan's Dairy still includes snaps of Derek on the family farm with is loved ones.

""Granny and Papa Roan [Derek] live at Barnbarroch and are very much involved in the day to day running of the farms,"" a picture of the family in the 'Who's who' section is captioned.

""Stuart and Aylett farm at Barnbarroch with their 2 sons Fergus and Fraser. The cows at Barnbarroch are milked by two Lely Robots which means the cows come and go as they please to get milk, giving them a much freedom to munch on lush green grass.""

The family came to the public's attention thanks to appearing on the BBC series This Farming Life.

This week, Les Brown, Procurator Fiscal for the Dumfries and Galloway district, issued notice of an FAI, with a first hearing to be held at Dumfries Sheriff Court in March.

A statement from Police Scotland issued at the time of Derek's death said: ""On Monday, 20 June 2022, we were made aware of the death of a 71-year-old man in Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary.

""The death is not being treated as suspicious and a report has been submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.""

A total of 34 people in Britain were killed in agriculture during 2021, according to figures by HSE.

The figure compares to an annual average number of 28 fatalities in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors over the last five years.

It comes as a third of Brits admit they are unsure what farmers really do - but two-thirds would like to learn more about where their food really comes from

Radio host Roman Kemp spent the day on a farm - to learn more about regenerative farming methods, and how farmers produce the food we eat.

It comes as two-thirds of Brits (65%) say they are keen to learn more about where their food really comes from - with a third admitting they are not sure what farmers actually do.

A poll of 2,000 adults found that many were surprised to learn that farming also involves analysing data, and taking a science-led approach to their daily tasks and duties.

And, while one in three are aware that farming is important, a quarter simply assume that a farmer's main role is to tend to livestock - rather than being involved in the production of fruit and vegetables.

In fact, it is adults over the age of 65 who are more knowledgeable about what regenerative farming means.

And McCain, which commissioned the research, sent Roman Kemp to a Rectory Farm in Oxfordshire, to learn about the farming practice, and how it can help the environment.

The Capital Breakfast radio host learned about the new practices that farmer Imogen Stanley, 32, is introducing at the farm, including planting wildflowers to attract birds and insects that help keep bad bugs at bay.

He also met soil health expert, Liz Stockdale, to understand more about how moving the soil less helps to keep it healthy.

Roman Kemp said: ""I got to ride in the tractor, and even met a soil health expert - who knew there was such a job!

""I learnt about methods including crop rotation to improve soil health, and wildflower planting to keep bad bugs at bay, as well as how McCain will be training and funding all its farmers in regenerative practices to ensure the future of our beloved chips.""

Respondents estimated only a third (34%) of their weekly food shop has been made or produced in an environmentally friendly way - however, 26% simply weren't sure how much was or wasn't.

And 31% put their trust in big businesses to make the right decisions when it comes to where their food is sourced, so they don't have to.

However, 42% admitted they have a bit of a ""sustainable blind spot"" when it comes to buying food, with a third rarely - or never - checking food packaging to make sure it's environmentally friendly.

But it is Gen Z respondents who were most likely to consider what effects the products they buy in the supermarket have on the environment, with 68% wanting to make informed choices.

Interestingly, over half (52%) of those polled, via OnePoll, do not realise that farming could have a positive role in tackling climate change.

However, some of the most common misconceptions that respondents had heard about farming included greenhouse gas emissions being higher than any other sector - and that a role in this area doesn't require any educational background.

Mark Hodge, from McCain Foods UK&I, added: ""Climate change is a real concern, especially for young people. We all want to do our bit to help, but on an individual level, the scale of change needed can feel overwhelming.

""We're hugely proud of our commitment to 100% regenerative farming by 2030. As more and more of our growers adopt these methods with the help of training and funding that we provide, consumers are able to chip in and support more sustainable farming.""

The former Top Gear presenter is the star of Clarkson's Farm - an Amazon Prime series which documents his attempts at running his Diddly Squat farm in the Cotswolds

Jeremy Clarkson shared a tweet about farmers being more vital than doctors and firefighters on Tuesday night, amid the government referencing the celebrity's famous farm earlier in the day.

The 63-year-old is the star of Clakrson's Farm - a series which documents his attempts at running his Diddly Squat farm in the Cotswolds.

The programme, which was renewed for a third series, has him attempting the challenge of farming the land himself with no experience.

It also stars Kaleb Cooper, a young farm worker who advises Jeremy on the technical details of using farming equipment and aids him with many tasks.

And now, Jeremy took to his social media to share some 'wise words' from Kaleb.

""You need a doctor once a year maybe and a fireman once in a lifetime if you're unlucky,"" he said.

""But you need a farmer three times a day. Wise words from Kaleb Cooper.""

Fans agreed with the sentiment and took to the comment section to praise Kaleb's words.

""Farmers are the backbone of civilization,"" one user said.

Another posted: ""Farmers are so vital. We don't give them enough credit, your show about your Farm shows what Farmers have to go through.""

""Kaleb deserves his own show,"" one posted.

It comes as the former Top Gear presenter found himself in a row over his plans to allow greater visitor access to his farm and its attached shop.

After the release of the show, tourists came to the Cotswolds in large groups, causing issues with the locals.

Jeremy wanted to extend the car park to accommodate 70 vehicles but West Oxfordshire District Council opposed it.

They claimed the extension would add traffic problems to the spot.

Jeremy was previously disputing with the local authority when the council shut down his restaurant after it was allegedly opened without planning permission.

Downing Street denied that the proposal to make it easier to turn farm buildings into retail spaces had been made with Clarkson's problems in mind.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak made a speech at the Farm to Fork conference, alongside supermarket bosses, industry chiefs and Whitehall officials.

With Kaleb in attendance, Mr Sunak said: ""We want to give British farmers greater freedoms to make the best use of their existing buildings, whether that's for a Diddly Squat-style farm shop or a processing facility.

""So we're going to consult on targeted changes to the planning system that enable exactly that and support our rural economy.""

Andrew Hollinshead was named BBC's 'green farmer of the year' in 2016 but has today been fined in court after ramming his seven tonne tractor into a doctor's car at a junction in Sandbach, Cheshire

A BBC farming show star who rammed his tractor into his neighbour's car has avoided jail time for the road rage row that turned violent.

Eco-friendly farmer Andrew Hollinshead ploughed GP Dr Paul Uglow's VW after being confronted for pulling out at a junction forcing the doctor to swerve, which damaged his wheels.

Hollinshead, who is also a parish councillor, has been ordered to pay more than £2,700 over the spat after it was heard Dr Uglow ended up with minor injuries when his car window shattered from the impact of the seven-tonne tractor, which was also adorned with mowing spikes at the time.

The 54-year-old farmer was named 'Green Farmer of the Year' by the BBC in 2016 for his efforts at minimising his carbon footprint, powering his site in Sandbach, Cheshire, using wind, solar and hydrogen energy.

But eco-minded Mr Hollinshead appeared before magistrates on Tuesday over the incident on July 11 last year, where the court heard Dr Uglow had been driving home from work when he was forced to swerve sideways to avoid hitting the tractor as it pulled out of a give way junction, with the farmer swearing at him to add insult to injury.

Prosecutor Simon Leong told the bench the GP then saw Mr Hollinshead pull in to the farm on his way home, so followed him in impulsively to reprimand him over his driving and exchange insurance details.

But in a rage, Mr Hollinshead ""rammed straight into the driver's side of the vehicle where Dr Uglow was sitting in the driver seat"", Mr Leong said.

The impact of the hit damaged his wheel arch and crumpled his driver's side door, causing glass to shatter which cut the GP's arm while also causing £15,000 in damage.

Mr Leong added: ""The defendant then got out of the tractor and said 'I will tell the police you pulled out in front of me.' He got back into his tractor and drove away.""

After Mr Hollinshead left the scene, Dr Uglow rang 999 telling the operator that he was ""shaking like a leaf"" and that the tractor driver was ""an absolute animal"".

Stuart Flood, for Mr Hollinshead, said his client had been driving tractors since the age of 16 and frequented that section of road near his farm multiple times a day.

""My client saw no traffic in either direction but the tractor is not as mobile as other vehicles and when Dr Uglow came up, he felt as though my client had pulled out in front of him,"" Mr Flood said.

He added that the doctor had then followed Mr Hollinshead onto his land where the confrontation took place, saying his client was ""extremely disappointed"", but ultimately respected the outcome at court.

""This is a very unfortunate situation. He is respected in the farming community by an awful lot of people.""

Mr Hollinshead denied wrongdoing but was convicted of criminal damage and assault occasioning actual bodily harm at Crewe magistrates court. He was ordered to pay £100 in compensation to Dr Uglow and fined £1,190 with £1,476 in costs.

Between 1955 and 1995, more than 70,000 West African children were privately fostered by White Britons, and many of them have lived with the long-lasting impact

When Ore Ogungbayi was little, like many children, she asked her parents where babies come from. ""My mummy told me, ""˜You get them from a catalogue',"" she says.

In Ore's case, this was the truth. Her British parents had seen her baby photo in a newspaper, advertised by her Nigerian parents for private fostering while they studied in the UK. ""After an interview with my Nigerian parents, they fostered me from two months old until I was seven,"" Ore, now 57, says.

""I thought they were my parents. I knew they loved me - they had given me so much love. It never occurred to me that they were White and I was Black - or that the people who sometimes visited were my real parents."" Between 1955 and 1995, more than 70,000 West African children were privately fostered by White Britons, in a practice known as ""˜farming'.

Many of them have lived with the long-lasting impact of this controversial and unregulated practice on their life and identity ever since - often in silence. Ore's experience of ""˜farming' ended abruptly when her mum and dad panicked that her British foster parents were about to try to adopt her.

""They kidnapped me,"" she says simply. ""They invited me to a Christmas party in London, took me outside to see the rocking horse they said they had bought me and told me to get in the car. There was no rocking horse. They took me to Nigeria, a country I knew nothing about. It was very traumatic. They told me my foster parents had moved and I couldn't get in touch with them.""

Yewande Ogunnaike, 60, was farmed out at two months old with her twin sister, and moved between families. ""The first place I really remember was Leicester and I just remember darkness,"" she says. ""It was so bad we had to be removed by social services.

""I remember darkness and being beaten so badly. I don't remember the sexual abuse, but I know it happened there. I remember a cigarette being put out underneath my chin. I was beaten so hard that I wet myself, and I was forced to lick it up off the lino floor. I remember ""˜n*****', ""˜n*****', ""˜n*****'.

""I remember they made me sleep in the bath because I wet the bed, with the dog's blanket for warmth."" Yewande's mother had come from Nigeria to the UK to study, before an arranged marriage back home. In London, she met and married a Nigerian architecture student, bringing shame on her well-known Royal family.

Yewande and her twin sister escaped their foster parents, but came home to find a second set of twins had been fostered, and their father had left for a new family. Their mother was unable to cope. ""In 1970 I was taken into care and sent to a children's home at the centre of a paedophile ring,"" she says. ""There was constant sexual abuse and rape.""

Her life since has been a battle for survival, and a fight to bring up her own children alone, one of whom has complex needs. But Yewande is determined her abusive childhood will not define her. ""I want to say that this is not a story of victimhood,"" she says. ""It's a story of surviving and ultimately thriving.""

Ore and Yewande were among fostered British-Nigerians brought together by film-maker Andy Mundy-Castle for a new feature documentary White Nanny, Black Child which tells the story of the complex legacy of farming. ""Across the decades, 100,000 people may have been privately fostered in this way,"" Mundy-Castle says of his film, which invited people with experience of the private fostering scheme to a retreat with the support of psychotherapy and well-being professionals.

""I have friends who had this experience - and to many people it's just something that happened in their childhood. But when I was going on my own personal journey of identity, I became more and more interested in it. I'm British-Nigerian, so it's unifying the story of me.""

The result is an emotionally arresting film, which will be screened at the Brixton Ritzy in South London over the weekend and on Channel 5 next Tuesday. Private fostering is hinted at in the autobiographies of the musician Seal and at hlete Kriss Akabusi but, until recently, the accounts of ""˜farmed children' went largely unrecorded.

Shola Amoo's semi-autobiographical film, The Last Tree was one of the first to tackle it in 2019. Now Mundy-Castle hopes his film will bring the experiences of tens of thousands of people into the light. When Ore was in her late teens, she returned to the UK. ""My experiences with my British family were beautiful,"" she tells me. ""It was my own mum who kidnapped me.""

Aged 21, she went to her foster parents' house. ""I had a speech prepared to ask where the family had gone,"" she says. ""My foster dad opened the door. I wasn't prepared for that. I was in shock. He recognised me straight away. ""˜Ore,' he said. ""˜I'd bought you a coat for Christmas and I was waiting to give it to you when you went'. He said my British mum had to be sedated when she found out I had been taken.""

Before the foster couple passed away, Ore visited with her mother so they could make peace. ""My mum was terrified,"" she says. ""But it was OK."" Over the years, she has come to understand that her Nigerian mum also acted out of love. ""But many people were hurt along the way.""

Globally, agriculture and land use are responsible for almost 60% of ­biodiversity loss and 30% of ­greenhouse gas emissions - and we also bin 9.5m tons of food waste each year

It is an uncomfortable fact that alongside transport and how we heat our homes, what we choose to eat is one of the greatest causes of ­environmental destruction.

Globally, agriculture and land use are responsible for almost 60% of ­biodiversity loss and 30% of ­greenhouse gas emissions. By 2050, a third of the UK's carbon emissions are likely to come from agriculture. We also bin about 9.5 million tons of food waste each year.

While it's a complex issue, the way our food is grown and eaten doesn't have to destroy nature. We can cut emissions, food loss and waste and restore wildlife habitats, while supporting producers to grow enough food. Here, we look at the major issues you can find on your plate and what you can do to Fix Our Food...

ANTIBIOTICS

British livestock farmers have reduced their reliance on antibiotics, which now makes up about 30% of all use of the drugs. Meat reared this way costs less as animals grow faster and can be kept in overcrowded conditions - but diseases can spread easily. An estimated 73% of all antibiotics are used for farm animals globally.

And the World Health Organisation and European Medicines Agency say overuse contributes to greater resistance in some human infections. Since Brexit, our rules are weaker than in the EU, which banned routine use for farm animals, plus imports of meat, dairy, fish and eggs using antibiotics for rapid growth.

The Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics said: ""Use in British pigs remains two-and-a-half times higher than in Denmark and the Netherlands."" There is also concern new trade deals could jeopardise public health and British farming standards. In the US and Canada, use of antibiotics is some five times the level here.

PESTICIDES

Pesticides are widely used in agriculture to control weeds, insects and diseases. In 2020, the most recent available data, the average number of active substances applied to arable crops in the UK was 13.5. We grow about 9.8 million acres - or 5.6 million football pitches - of arable crops. The RSPB says in 2020, each could be treated with pesticides up to 10 times per year.

The charity is urging the Government to set reduction targets and warns: ""Farmland biodiversity continues to decline, with bird populations more than halving since 1973 and arable wildflowers becoming one of the most threatened groups of plants. Changes in practices, including increased use of pesticides, is likely to have been the leading cause. Insect declines are of great concern."" To avoid produce grown with pesticides, look for the Soil Association logo to find foods produced in a nature-friendly way. You should also wash food before eating it.

POLLUTION

In recent decades, pressure to provide food at low prices has pushed farmers to boost livestock numbers and use more fertilisers and pesticides to increase crop yields. Hedgerows have also been removed to make larger, more efficient fields. This has all resulted in pollution of waterways with soil sludge, toxic chemicals and excess nutrients, including nitrogen and phosphorus.

Sarah Ison, of Compassion in World Farming, said: ""To feed a growing global population, recycling nutrients from animal manure and compost is no longer enough. Synthetic fertilisers that include nitrogen, which is energy intensive to make, and mined phosphorus, which is running out, are used. But excess nitrogen and phosphorus is lost into the environment, causing toxic algal blooms and damaging aquatic life, as well as contributing to air pollution. This pollution is also threatening many species of animals and plants to extinction.""

ANIMAL WELFARE

Britain is one of the world leaders in animal welfare but there is still a long way to go. According to the RSPCA, about a billion chickens are slaughtered in the UK every year - or 2,000 every minute - and 90% of them are fast-growing breeds to keep up with demand. Sarah Ison, from Compassion in World Farming, said the chickens ""are bred to grow so fast that they experience disease, disability and pain while being kept in overcrowded sheds"".

Pigs too are an issue. She added: ""Breeding sows are confined to cages when they birth and nurse their piglets, where they are often tail docked, have their teeth shortened and - if imported from countries that do so - can be castrated with no pain relief of anaesthetics."" New trade deals could see standards drop. For example, unlike the UK, Australia allows mulesing, where the skin around a lamb's buttocks is cut off without pain relief. It is used to reduce flystrike in merino wool production but the wounds can take weeks to heal.

IS EATING LOCAL BEST?

Unfortunately not as most emissions come from food production, not transportation. For example, a tomato grown in a heated greenhouse in the UK uses three times more energy than a field-grown Spanish tomato that is transported to our supermarkets. Joanna Trewern, head of policy (consumption) at the World Wide Fund For Nature said: ""Research shows the type of food and how it is produced matters more than food miles.

Transporting food accounts for just 5% of a food's carbon footprint on average - the exception being for the 1% of our food that arrives in the UK by air. One of the most impactful things you could do is eat more vegetables and pulses. Chickpeas, beans and lentils taste great in curries, stews and chillies, and growing them has a lower impact on the environment. Using these tasty and filling foods to bulk out meals can help reduce the cost of your weekly shop as well as your environmental impact.""

Clarkson's Farm's Kaleb Cooper looked dapper as he arrived at 10 Downing Street for the Farm to Fork summit today, which hopes to secure the UK's supermarket supply chains

Clarkson's Farm's Kaleb Cooper rocked up at Downing Street today for the Government's Farm to Fork summit.

The farming contractor 24, who stars alongside Jeremy Clarkson in the Amazon show, was among a selection of food leaders hoping to secure the UK's supermarket supply chains.

The summit follows an announcement that farmers are to be given greater protection in future trade deals as part of a new package of measures unveiled recently.

Former Top Gear host Jeremy, 63, has revealed he is facing financial worries on Diddly Squat Farm after ""selling food at a loss"".

Claiming it was 'the last roll of the dice', he said: ""On top of the physical issues, which will only get worse, there are financial problems too. And they're going to get worse as well.

'Because the grants and subsidies that I used to get from the EU, to recompense me for selling food at a loss, are dwindling until, in three years' time, they will dry up completely. These, then, are troubling times, because what am I to do?

""Farming hurts my back and my knees, and if I attempt to use my land to grow food, I'll lose money. It has been causing me some sleepless nights, that's for sure,"" reports The Sunday Times.

Kaleb, meanwhile, who gained an army of fans with his witty putdowns on Clarkson's Farm has shared a dramatic new career move - which will help budding farmers.

The father-of-one has joined forces with the Royal Agricultural University (RAU) to launch a new bursary for those looking to follow in his footsteps and launch a career in agriculture.

The self-made agricultural entrepreneur has been working in and around farms since he was at school and wants to help those who share his passion.

Launching the bursary to students at Cirencester University on last week, he said: ""Farming is who I am. Encouraging the younger generation into agriculture has always been so important to me.

""I feel lucky that I knew my path from such an early age and want to help spread that passion and drive. Launching this bursary means so much, as it can support students who want to pursue an agricultural career or who might be struggling to get into farming.""

Kaleb is also set to become a father again after he revealed in January he and his fiancÃ©e Taya are expecting a girl.

The couple are already proud parents to son, Oscar and told fans they were delighted about welcoming a new addition to the family.

A new report has shone a light on Russia's systematic and pre-planned appropriation of Ukrainian grain - causing supply issues globally - with over £1billion worth of grain stolen so far

Vladimir Putin has a secret weapon in his belt to assist in Russia's war against Ukraine - but it is not of the type you might expect.

Farmers in occupied Zaporizhzhia revealed that the Russian military has been confiscating their crops since only five days into their invasion of Ukrainian territories on February 24, 2022. New evidence has now come to light showing that the Kremlin has stolen over £1 billion worth of grain from Ukrainian farmers in order to fund their war and create instability in the global food markets.

The first mass-extraction of grain was documented last year in mid-March, with disused railways in the region being refurbished in order to transport the stolen food. A new report by Global Rights Compliance has assessed the extent of grain-theft from the Kremlin.

Russian agricultural companies have been named in the new report, ""˜Agriculture Weaponised', as supporting the effort - partly by carrying out works on the old infrastructure. Images on Telegram showed officials from the Luhansk People's Republic - a Russia-aligned Ukrainian organisation - boasting about the theft of thousands of tonnes of grain at the seized Starobilski facility.

The grain would be taken to export ports controlled by Russia, such as Berdiansk (Ukraine), Sevastopol and Kerch (Crimea), and Rostov-on-Don (Russia). They would be transported via the refurbished Luhansk Railway, the Metro reported.

Starobilsky Elevator and State Grain Operator, two companies working in Russian-controlled areas, have extracted grain for international export according to analysis of satellite images. It is expected that a huge amount of pre-planning was put into the appropriation of Ukraine's grain supply - given the speed at which Russia acted following the invasion.

""The facts speak for themselves - as they progressed in their invasion of Ukrainian territory, Russian and affiliated forces systematically seized grain elevators, equipment, and transportation infrastructure on road, rail, and sea,"" said Naomi Prodeau, one of the report's authors. ""This logistical takeover was strategic and is thieving thousands of tonnes of Ukrainian grain each day, the yearly loss reaching one billion dollars.

""Such direct targeting of the most essential necessity holds hostage to Russian volition not only Ukrainian civilians, but people around the world who rely on this grain for tomorrow's meal. This cannot escape the attention of the UK's Summit on Global Food Security,"" she added.

The report shows convoys of vehicles carrying grain to the Crimean Peninsula following the invasion - with the GPS trackers of stolen trucks showing they drove through Crimea and into Russia. Trains which carried grain on the railways from June 2022 onwards were branded with the Russian Railway logo - Russia's state-owned rail service.

Furthermore, job ads on Telegram from Russian companies which were analysed by investigators on the report suggest they were not able to hire enough drivers to transport the huge amounts of grain stolen from Ukraine. After the occupation multiple private Ukrainian grain companies were forced under the control of Russia's State Grain Operator - which claims to have the capacity to export 12,000 tonnes of grain per day.

Catriona Murdoch, a partner at Global Rights Compliance, says the report demonstrates an ""insidious backdrop"" in which Russia has dismantled Ukraine's agricultural output and destroyed livelihoods - all while creating a food crisis globally. ""Russia does this through systematic extraction of grain; transporting it to occupied areas inside Ukraine or cross-border into Russia; and then relentlessly attacking and destroying grain infrastructure and Ukrainian ports,"" she explained.

This has caused serious supply issues for countries in the Horn of Africa, Sahel, Yemen and Afghanistan - all who suffer from food insecurity. It has also been indirectly felt in the UK with price rises in the supermarkets.

Researchers at the University of Warwick were looking for ways to solve the labour shortage after The National Farmers' Union found two in five farmers have lost crops because there was no one to pick them

Say hello to a high-tech beast of the field that's set to save our struggling farms.

This four-legged robot dog known as Spot and an AI crop-monitoring vehicle called Crombot are possible solutions to farm labour shortages. A survey found that 40% of farmers have lost crops because there was no one to pick them. More than £60million worth of food was wasted in the first half of 2022 alone, says the National Farmers' Union.

Crombot is a four-wheeled greenhouse helper with a camera on a telescopic arm. It can tell if crops are ripe, detect pests and diseases, and has already been used to harvest strawberries in a trial dubbed ""Robocrop"" at the University of Warwick. Researchers also bought a £90,000 robot dog to try out automated harvesting and planting.

""Spot"" was designed by Boston Dynamic to cope with terrain like muddy fields. Project chief Alex Keller said: ""Spot could be an ideal solution for an agricultural monitoring robot, but is currently very expensive. We are continuing to develop our in-house robotic capabilities.""

Engineer Harry Boyce added: ""Our research with Crombot aims to address growers' scepticism of new technology."" Mr Keller said: ""We hope to hear from growers who would like to be involved in this research - finding out how they can incorporate robots in their practices too.

Kaleb Cooper is a father again after the Clarkson's Farm star announced his fiancÃ©e Taya had given birth to their daughter, who has the most adorable name

Clarkson's Farm star Kaleb Cooper and his fiancÃ©e Taya are proud parents to a baby girl.

Kaleb, 24, who shares Oscar, two, with his partner jumped on Instagram to share the good news.

Posting a pic of the tot wrapped up in a blanket, he wrote: ""Welcome to the world. Willa Grace Cooper. Born in CHIPPING NORTON"".

A host of famous faces flocked to congratulate the farming guru with GB News' Eamonn Holmes replying: ""Congratulations Kaleb to you and your wife"".

Meanwhile boss Jeremy Clarkson's Hawkstone beer brand commented: ""Congratulations! We're drinking your cider to celebrate tonight!"".

Kaleb, who got engaged on Christmas Day last year, has confidently guided the former Top Gear host through the ups and downs of life on Diddly Squat Farm.

However, the Cotswold native shocked fans recently when he announced he was swapping the fields for the theatre.

Last week, Kaleb took to Instagram to reveal the exciting news, announcing: ""I'm braving it and leaving Chippy for a UK theatre tour!

""I'll be announcing my first show tomorrow morning, that's going on sale from 10am.""

Kaleb later confirmed his first gig would be in Nottingham as he said he was ""really looking forward to it"" because the theatre was a ""big old barn.""

Promoting the show, which is called Life According to Kaleb, the farming expert wrote: ""The first available date to book tickets for my national tour is going to be in a big old barn called the Nottingham Royal Concert Hall!""

Speaking to The Times magazine in 2022, Kaleb revealed the furthest he had ever travelled from his village is London, which he had visited three times at that point, and hated, describing it as ""f****** awful"".

However, it looks like he's embracing a change after also teaming up with Royal Agricultural University (RAU) to launch a new bursary for those looking to launch a career in agriculture.

Launching the bursary in May at Cirencester University, he said: ""Farming is who I am. Encouraging the younger generation into agriculture has always been so important to me. I feel lucky that I knew my path from such an early age and want to help spread that passion and drive.

""Launching this bursary means so much, as it can support students who want to pursue an agricultural career or who might be struggling to get into farming.""

Jeremy Clarkson has turned his hand to agriculture in his new Amazon Prime Video series Clarkson's Farm but has taken exception to former Top Gear co-presenter James May's comments on farming

Jeremy Clarkson has hit out at his good friend and former Top Gear co-host James May for his comments on farming.

The pair, alongside Richard Hammond, were the face of the popular BBC magazine show between 2003 and 2015 until Jeremy's contract was not renewed.

The trio were soon back working together on Amazon Prime Video under a new motoring series called The Grand Tour, which has flourished since debuting in 2016.

Clarkson, Hammond and May are renown for their comradery between one another but appears that the latter has got under the skin of Jeremy with his comments about farming in 2021.

Jeremy has turned his hand to agriculture in his new Amazon Prime Video series Clarkson's Farm, which has earned rave reviews following the two seasons of his docuseries on the streaming network.

The series documents the former Top Gear host's attempts at running his 1,000 acre 'Diddly Squat' farm in a sleepy village in the Cotswolds.

In 2021, James was asked if he would give his longtime co-presenter a hand on his farm, to which he replied: ""James said: 'I don't want to do farming myself because I think that farming is just big gardening, and gardening is one of the things I don't do at home'.""

Jeremy referenced the comments in a number of tweets earlier this month after James mocked farm produce on the social media platform.

James wrote: ""Is all that sourdough and spelt b****x over yet? I fancy a piece of bread."" Jeremy clapped back: ""Oh do f**k off.""

The Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? host doubled down on his criticism of James in response to other Twitter users.

He said: ""James is not a man who understands this kind of thing. He likes Spam,"" while replying to another fan: ""James is not across the problems of farming.""

Jeremy added: ""He called farming 'big gardening'. He's not a man we can trust on the subject.""

The second season of Clarkson's Farm has broken new records for Amazon Prime after it became one of the most watched shows after it was released last week.

The platform revealed 4.3million viewers watched the second season of the farming reality show, making it Amazon's highest rated show since the company began reporting viewing figures in November 2021.

The figures for Clarkson's adventures at Diddly Squat Farm even beat The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power which reached 3.2million viewers when it was released last year. The show was also watched by more viewers than Love Island and the Brit Awards.

Shoppers in the UK may be struggling to get their hands on fresh fruit and veg right now but the surface of Moon could soon have a thriving selection with a futuristic lunar farm, scientists claim

Scientists have unveiled groundbreaking proposals for growing fresh fruit and vegetables on the surface of the Moon.

Under the plans, lunar soil could be used to help grow food in a futuristic space farm not unlike the one managed by Matt Damon's character in 2015 sci-fi flick The Martian.

It is hoped the European Space Agency project - entitled Enabling Lunar In-Situ Agriculture by Producing Fertilizer from Beneficiated Regolith - will help future human colonies survive on the barren space rock.

The impressive structure would use a hi-tech system to mechanically sort soil from the Moon (also known as regolith) before dissolving it into water.

An artist's impression shows three separate working parts to the proposed lunar farm, which includes a pump, a processing plant and a greenhouse-like structure.

Because the Moon's soil lacks all the necessary nutrients to support vegetation a method called hydroponic farming would be used, which allows plants to be grown using only water.

Ongoing experiments in the innovative technique have been taking place at the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute in collaboration with ESA, Solsys Mining and the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Space.

Though no word as been given on what vegetables would be grown on the surface of the Moon, it is hoped the study will help show which are most suited to hydroponic farming.

Some of the success stories from experiments so far have included produce which is in desperate short supply back in the UK at the moment, including tomatoes, beans, and peppers.

Speaking on the announcement of the project, ESA materials and processes engineer Malgorzata Holynska said: ""This work is essential for future long-term lunar exploration.

""Achieving a sustainable presence on the Moon will involve using local resources and gaining access to nutrients present in lunar regolith with the potential to help cultivate plants.""

""The current study represents a proof of principle using available lunar regolith simulants, opening the way to more detailed research in future.""

The research project began in December last year, and estimated to last until the end of 2023 with a budget of â‚¬100,000 (£88,000).

The actor who played Victor Krum, Hermione's love interest in the franchise, looks completely different 20 years on from his appearance in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

The Harry Potter star who played Viktor Krum in the franchise looks completely different after cropping up on video sharing site Cameo.

Fans can use the site to connect with their favourite celebs and ask them to record a personalised message - for a price. But Stanislav Yanevski, who played Quidditch star Krum in Harry Potter and the Goblet Fire is pretty much unrecognisable. Of course - most people will look different after 20 years, but Yanevski has morphed from the clean-shaven love interest of Hermione Granger into a bearded, tattooed and ripped fitness enthusiast.

The Bulgarian actor was a youthful 20-year-old when the 2005 film was released, and now, aged 38 he is looking a lot more rugged, and describes himself as an actor and an adventurer in his Instagram bio. For the reasonable price of £29, fans can get a Cameo video from Yanevski, who is rated 4.98 out of five on the site.

He regularly shares updates of his adventures around the world, where he's often seen with a mountain bike or perfecting his physique in the gym with his 230,000 followers. He also still acts and has appeared in films including Resistance, The 11th Grade and Last Man Down.

Stanislav makes it clear that he is proud of his Harry Potter experience, and is often seen at conventions relating to the film, including WizardCon in Dublin. In April 2022 he shared a photo of himself wearing the Harry Potter sorting hat. He wrote: ""True friends are never apart, maybe in distance but never in heart.""

Given the Harry Potter cast were all so young when they first rose to fame, it's no surprise they have all had huge transformations over the last 20 odd years.

Another of the franchise's stars - Jamie Waylett who played Vincent Crabbe in all six of the movies - was also spotted on Cameo. He had tough few years after making a name for himself in the films, when he was sacked by Harry Potter bosses when he was caught growing cannabis in his home.

After being sentenced to 120 hours community service, he was convicted of violent disorder in 2012 and was jailed for two years. He was seen swigging champagne from a stolen bottle during the London riots and was pictured holding a petrol bomb, although he was cleared of intending to destroy or damage property.

He's now turned his life around but looks totally different from his Vincent Crabbe days. In his Cameo intro video, he has a face tattoo and beard. He jokes to fans that he's still a Slytherin, saying: ""What's going on people, it's your boy Jamie Waylett. I played Vincent Crabbe in the Harry Potter movies one to six and I'm very excited to have the opportunity to give the people and loved ones in your life that you care about a special message. That's it from me, I look forward to hearing from you. Slytherin for life.""

Carly Burd has been growing produce to help feed those in need from her allotment in Harlow, Essex, since last July, but over the weekend sick vandals tore up the plants and salted the earth

A woman sobbed as she revealed how cruel vandals broke into her allotment, destroyed the crops she had fed hundreds of people with and salted the Earth.

Carly Burd has been growing her own vegetables since last July and says she has helped to help feed over 1,600 people during the cost of living crisis.

The 43-year-old, who lives with multiple sclerosis and lupus and is on disability benefits, shared her produce with her local community as countless Brits struggled with rocketing food prices.

But on Saturday 8 April, Carly, from Harlow, Essex, revealed how unknown thugs have destroyed her garden completely and ruined her produce.

""I came down on Saturday morning and I just tasted and saw [the salt].

""Five kilograms plus of salt has been poured over my garden. It wasn't a kid grabbing it - it was an adult who knew what they were doing.

""What's heart-wrenching is that those onions were planted by children and they really put their effort in to put something back into the community.

""I felt like I'd been kicked in the face. I have no other explanation for it.

""Who would do that? It's just the most repulsive act I've ever known.

""[There's a huge] amount of people that it's going to affect, it's also affecting nature.

""All of the nature that's in the ground, all the worms, they're all dead. It has a massive impact.""

The green-fingered mum-of-three shared the news in a heartbreaking post on social media.

But she is undeterred by the sick vandalism and has promised to continue her good work.

She is instead planning on converting the damaged land into an outdoor space, where the community can enjoy teas, coffees and meals together.

In the meantime, Carly is planning on growing food in a different section of the allotment so that she can still deliver food parcels to those in need.

Carly said: ""Going forward, we carry on going. We're moving the other way, and trying to dig up as much as we can to get as much veg in the ground as we can.

""But affecting 300 people - that's a lot of veg in the ground I've just lost.

""On that land, we can't plant at all. Nothing will grow, so we're going to have an outdoor space with a tea and coffee area.

""We're going to invite the community over and have meal nights instead.

""All I can do at the moment is keep cracking on, I can't do anything else.""

Carly hit the headlines after she said she ""panicked"" last summer, amid rising food and petrol prices.

She decided to grow her own food, but quickly saw how she could help others and dug up her flower beds and replaced them with more produce.

She shares her story on social media and says she has fed over 1,300 people with her home grown veg which she puts into care packages.

Carly revealed what had happened in a heartbreaking TikTok and has long been fundraising to help her efforts.

If you're limited in space or prefer to stay warm, gardening experts have revealed the best vegetables to grow indoors this winter - and there's plenty to choose from

When it comes to gardening, you don't need to have a huge garden or outdoor space to grow delicious vegetables and blooming plants. In fact, there are many crops that thrive indoors with limited space.

If you don't have access to the outdoors, all you need is a sunny window and plenty of patience while you wait for your vegetables to sprout this winter. According to Bonnie Plants, there are some important steps that you should follow to ensure your veggies grow successfully inside.

Firstly, it's important to choose an indoor space with good lighting and warmer temperatures - avoid cold, drafty areas. Green-fingered folk should also keep their plants away from heat vents and fireplaces, as this dries them out and overheats them.

Make sure to use containers with drainage holes and use good-quality soil to guarantee the best growth. It's essential to water your plants regularly and keep an eye out for any pests and plant diseases.

If you're looking to harvest your own edible indoor garden, Bonnie Plants has revealed the best place to start. As the temperatures start to drop, here's the full list of home-grown vegetables you can enjoy this winter.

Lettuce

This versatile veggie can grow quickly and easily, but they need to be placed by a very sunny window to thrive. If your natural light is dim, Attainable Sustainable recommends providing supplemental lighting to help the growth. It writes: ""The full spectrum of light should be placed about 4 inches above the top of the leaves.""

Tomatoes

Bonnie Plants says it's important to pick dwarf-type tomatoes, which are bred for container growing. Tomato Growing notes that you can get ""very good results"" by growing the plant on a windowsill in a six to eight inch pot.

Peppers

Peppers need at least six to eight hours of sunlight a day, so make sure to place the vegetable plant in a well-lit area. Bonnie Plants adds that smaller peppers, including chilli and shishitos, are great additions for your indoor garden.

Microgreens

Microgreens are a great source of nutrients, and packed with vitamin A, E, C and K, as well as calcium, magnesium, iron, selenium and zinc, notes Banner Health. They are young seedlings of edible vegetables and herbs, including radishes, kale, basil, and mustard greens. Bonnie Plants suggests they should be grown in a shallow container, and placed in a sunny area.

Chives

Chives grow nicely in pots and are a great replacement for garlic and onion - which are difficult to grow inside. Make sure they are placed in a bright, sunny location and the pots have holes in the bottom for drainage. The gardening site adds that there are a selection of other winter plants that thrive indoors, including:

Gardeners are being warned not to kill slugs and snails with data showing 48% of bird species having declined in the UK over a five-year period, with the gastropods crucial to keep their numbers up

Gardeners are being warned not to kill slugs and snails or use pest control pellets this summer.

The gastropod cousins are usually found during wet autumn days under sodden leaves - but they can even strike during the hottest times of the year.

Those growing fruit and veg will be all too aware of how the little garden dwellers can leave neatly curated holes.

But people are being warned not to try and eradicate them - and it's do to with bird populations.

Bird numbers in the UK have steadily declined in the UK in the past 50 years.

Data released by the government this year, 2023, showed a mammoth 48% of bird species have declined in numbers in just the five years between 2015 and 2020, a huge and sudden drop.

The main cause of this is habitat loss and the loss of mixed farming.

On the other hand, reduced numbers of weeds and shorter lawns have both contributed, because there's fewer insects and indeed slugs and snails for birds to eat in urban environments where gardens are carefully managed and wildlife is stripped out and killed.

Read More

Killing slugs and snails also impacts on threatened hedgehog numbers, which rely on slugs as part of their diet, reports YorkshireLive.

In 2021, slug pellets containing a toxin metaldehyde were banned from sale in the UK. That's because the toxin was also poisonous to birds who ate the slugs which had eaten the pellets.

But even if you don't use slug pellets, killing slugs with things like scissors, stamping, or beer traps is still contributing to the decline of bird species, which in turn damages the entire food chain at a time when the environment is in crisis.

Some gardeners have suggested bird-friendly ways to curb slug problems without resorting to killing them.

One poster said: ""Get a honeydew melon. Cut in half. Eat the melon while preserving the skin in two 'Hemi-spheres.'

""Then go and put the melon skin in your garden near the crops - facing downwards, so it's like a dome.

""Then go and lift the melon up the next morning and you will see (nearly) every slug in your garden is in that melon, because they would rather eat melon than your crops. You can then go and put the melon miles away, or at least as far as possible, and it's bye-bye slugs!

""Although please note there are 22 species of slugs in UK, and only 2 of those want to eat your live crops.

""The others eat dead stuff, rotting wood etc, and we rely on them to do so, otherwise the whole world would be full of dead stuff just lying there forever. And those big Leopard slugs eat the crop-eating slugs, so you want to keep them. We have to avoid methods that kill or eradicate the majority of good slugs.""

Another said: ""Stop waging war on wildlife. If you gardened with nature in mind you get predators. Hedgehogs, slow worms, amphibians and birds will come with the right habitats. I have next to zero issues with slugs because I garden organically and for wildlife.

""Slug pellets are being banned for a reason, they are an indiscriminate poison the effects of which ripple up the food chain. If you don't create an environment which encourages wildlife then you won't get a healthy assemblage of species and the impact of that is imbalance.""

A third added: ""Please don't use pellets. No matter what they say on the packet these things are horrible for all the wildlife in your garden as any poison will simply accumulate up the food chain and harm other creatures. There's zero reason to resort to chemicals to deal with slugs or snails.

""Accepting you have to live with them as post of the garden ecosystem is a good start; no point trying to eradicate something when in most of the garden it's doing no harm. They provide food for numerous creatures and even help break down vegetation.""

They added that you can use natural means to get slugs out of your garden, such as putting up wool barriers, or cracking egg shells on the soil, which slugs won't want to cross.

Copper tape is another option that repels slugs and snails without harming them, to keep them off prized crops and flowers.

So there you have it: be kind to the slugs and help save the planet - before it's too late for the UK's wonderfully diverse bird species.

Australian farmers have been left devastated after millions of rodents wreaked havoc on north Queensland's sugarcane crops to disrupt what should have been a bumper year

A rodent plague has decimated crops in Australia as rapidly breeding rats devour sugarcane fields.

Crops in north Queensland have been ruined, with the rat infestation widespread in the Herbert River Valley near Townsville - almost 1,000 miles north of Brisbane.

Rat numbers are usually kept in check by the wet season but an unusually dry spell of weather has allowed them to breed.

A single rat can create 460 offspring in a single year, allowing for rapid population growth.

It had been anticipated that 2023 would be one of the best years on record for sugarcane farmers, but the bumper crop is now being consumed by swarms of hungry rats instead.

The Sun reported Lawrence Di Bella, a local farmer, as saying: ""Within two weeks, whole fields will disappear.

""It's the worst rat year that I've seen in my working career in the industry.""

Di Bella added: ""You can see the paddock is alive.

""You can see little animals popping up and down everywhere in the fields.""

There is a reluctance to use baiting to control and eradicate pest numbers, with the method seen as a last resort.

Baiting can kill predators that consume rat carcasses, potentially wiping out native species.

The east coast of Australia also saw rodents rampage through crops in 2021, when a mouse plague caused huge disruption.

On that occasion the decision was taken to blitz the rapidly growing mouse infestation with thousands of litres of rodent poison dubbed ""napalm for mice"".

For months, tens of millions of mice plagued a 600-mile stretch of farm land on the eastern coast between Brisbane and Melbourne.

The critters decimated crops and food storage units, as well as invading homes, schools and hospitals.

Colorado beetles, which swarm like a plague of locusts and can devastate crops, were last recorded in the UK in 1977- a year after one of the hottest summers and worst droughts in living memory

Britain's potato farmers face a battle with a menace which has not been seen in our fields since the Queen's silver jubilee year.

Colorado beetles, which swarm like a plague of locusts and can devastate crops, were last recorded in the UK in 1977- a year after one of the hottest summers and worst droughts in living memory.

Farmers thought they'd seen the last of the pest which can completely strip the leaves from potato plants. But to their horror, DEFRA said today that a Colorado potato beetle has been found in Kent.

Farmers have been urged to 'remain vigilant because the pest poses a significant threat to potato crops'. If Britain's spud crops are devastated, more will have to be imported from abroad and it will push up prices in the shops.

Defra and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) say the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) larvae was found in a crop of potatoes in Kent.

The agency is working closely with the affected grower to eradicate the pest from the field, including performing a 1km survey to determine whether there are further cases beyond the immediately infested area.

They warn that if not destroyed in time, Colorado potato beetles are a significant threat to potato crops.

The adult beetles and larvae feed on the foliage of potatoes and can completely strip them of their leaves if they are left uncontrolled.

UK chief plant health officer Nicola Spence said "" `While this pest does not pose a threat to human health, we encourage all growers, farmers, processors and the public to remain vigilant and report any sightings, especially in
Kent.""

The beetle is bright yellow or orange with black stripes and is usually 8.5-11.5mm in length and 3mm wide. Its larvae are a reddish brown in colour, round and globular, up to 15mm in length.

Although distinctive in appearance, there are several beetles that are frequently mistaken for them. A Defra factsheet (PDF) is available to help with identification.

Apha said that the beetles were occasionally imported into the UK from continental Europe as 'hitchhikers' on non-host plant material, such as leafy vegetables, salad leaves, fresh herbs and grains.

But the threat from the Kent field is different and far more serious because they have appeared on a crop of growing potatoes.

In the past 70 years, there have been two UK outbreaks of the pest, one in 1976 and one in 1977. Both outbreaks were eradicated shortly after detection.

The beetle is not native to the UK and is currently regulated as a Great Britain quarantine pest, with import and movement restrictions in place for susceptible host material.

The British potato industry is estimated to be worth more than £700 million a year, with almost six million tonnes of spuds produced.

The origins of the beetle aren't clear but they got their name in 1865 when some were identified in Colorado, USA.

The farmer found out from a neighbour that cars had started to appear on his land when a nearby car park became full - and discovered that there were more than a thousand vehicles on site

A disgruntled farmer has blasted local authorities after 'more than a thousand' drivers reportedly descended on his field when a nearby car park became full.

Willie Innes, who runs East Hermiston Farm near Edinburgh, was alerted by a neighbour after the vehicles began to appear on his land on Saturday afternoon.

Cars and camper vans heading to the Scottish capital for the rugby and Fringe Festival crammed into the space when the adjacent Hermiston Park and Ride facility reached capacity, reports Edinburgh Live, leaving him forced to deal with ruined land in the aftermath.

Around 200 vehicles still remained on-site on Sunday morning, and the farm owner claims he will have to completely re-sow the field once they have all left.

He told the local news outlet: ""Individuals have turned up to the Park and Ride to go to the rugby and into the Fringe but they found it was full, so decided to park in my field... one car must have gone in and the rest followed - there were over 1,000 cars in there. My neighbour phoned me and said ""˜I didn't know you were growing cars this year.

""We just planted cereal crops in the field this week and they have not gone through the ground yet so they were not visible. But now they have been completely destroyed so we will have to go in and redo it. The cars being left there will mean we will have to re-sow the crops. The field is 23 acres, and about seven acres of it has been damaged - it is a massive loss of income for the farm. I considered blocking them in but I did not want to get involved in a confrontation so I phoned the police.

The same issue also occurred in 2019, Mr Innes added, and he said he believes the problem ""highlights that the Park and Ride is not big enough"" for when special events are being held in the city. He is now planning to install a fence on the farm to ensure people are not able to gain unauthorised access in future.

He said: ""There is nothing we can do as well until the cars are gone. It is part of farming next to a city I guess where people are not educated on farming. We will now have to pay money to put gates and a fence up so that this does not happen again.""

A post on the Croppie website, for crop circle enthusiasts, described the new pictogram as a 'reproduction, remaster, even, of the most iconic crop circle of all time'

Cover versions might never quite be as good as the original - but this remaster of a rock classic looks just like the real thing. The Eastfield Pictogram, first spotted in 1990, was the most famous example of the

phenomenon.

It was used by rock legends Led Zeppelin for their Remasters album, released in October that year. Now a copy of the 600ft pictogram has appeared in a field in Rushock, Worcs, 90 miles from the original. The site is close to the grave of the band's drummer John Bonham, who died in 1980 after a drinking binge.

A post on the Croppie website, for crop circle enthusiasts, described it as a ""reproduction, remaster, even, of the most iconic crop circle of all time.""

Photographer Kris Malford, who snapped the new circle, said: ""I find them magical - the happiness they bring to people. They make people think about what's going on in the world around you.""

Crop circles went ""˜viral' long before the creation of social media, thanks to their mysterious origins. They first appeared in southern England in the late 1970s, concentrated in Wiltshire and Hampshire.

Many enthusiasts believed they were caused by UFO landings, while some said magnetic shifts were behind the phenomenon. Others believe their origins come from ley lines - seams of spiritual energy that intersect sacred sites including Stonehenge. But the mystery appeared to have finally been solved in 1991, when two landscape painters came forward to claim responsibility.

David Chorley, 67, and Douglas Bower, 62, said they came up with the idea in 1978 while drinking in a Hampshire pub. The pair spent 13 years sneaking around southern England under the cover of darkness, creating crop circles. At the height of their prank, the men said they were creating up to 30 each summer, using a plank and piece of rope.

They said they stomped down the crop without breaking the wheat shafts and used ropes tied to a central stake to make the circles. They were aided by a piece of wire hanging down from a baseball cap like a gun sight, to make sure their lines were straight. Their story made the front of the Today newspaper under the headline: ""Men who conned the world.""

David and Douglas said they watched in amusement as their antics gripped the country and began being copied around the world. But their confession was not enough to rule out an extra-terrestrial link in the eyes of many people.

Some scientists accepted hoaxers had created intricate circles, but said other simpler versions were formed by magnetic shifts. They claimed magnetic fields gave rise to a current which electrocuted the crops, forcing them to lie flat on the ground. Some UFO obsessives even argued that ""˜fakers' had been instructed to create the crop circles subconsciously by aliens.

In the late 1990s, US billionaire Laurance Rockefeller funded a huge UK survey of crop circles. Scientists carried out aerial research over Wiltshire in the hope of finding out their origins. US companies even advertised week-long tours of UK crop circles for an eye-watering £2,000 per-person.

In the 80s and 90s heyday of the phenomenon, there were five main groups in the UK creating crop circles almost every night during summer.

Some even branched out into lucrative private work, creating logos in fields for companies such as Nike, Pepsi and Greenpeace.

Public interest peaked with the Eastfield Pictogram, which appeared in a field in Alton Barnes, Wilts. Farmer Tim Carson turned a tidy profit by charging people £1 for a look. But while crop circles have long since vanished from news bulletins and front pages, they remain a familiar sight during UK summers.

Data released last week showed Wiltshire remains the county with the most crop circles in England. There have been 380 recorded since 2005, according to the Crop Circle Visitor Centre and Exhibition in Honey Street, near Pewsey, Wilts. Monique Klinkenbergh, researcher and founder of the Crop Circle Visitor Centre & Exhibition who helped with the research, said: ""There are obviously man-made ones out there.

""But if you listen to eyewitness accounts, the unexplained circles have one thing in common. They were formed in minutes, or seconds. There is definitely a mystery going on, but it's very hard to label the source, whether it is extra-terrestrial, paranormal or just nature. Wiltshire is so famous for its sites of heritage, and I believe the crop circles are attracted to those places.""

Nowadays, ""˜croppies' use drones to capture instant images and footage of their latest designs and post them on social media. Crop circle season begins at the end of May, when barley first ripens, and ends with the harvest in September. Last month, two new crop circles appeared in Winterbourne Bassett, near Swindon, and Potterne Hill, near Devizes, within three days of each other - both in Wiltshire.

So it seems to the annoyance of many farmers, crop circles will not be disappearing from the UK countryside any time soon. And each time one appears, the same question will be on everyone's lips: ""How on earth was that made?""

Farmer Steve Cornwell attempted to tip off leading supermarkets Aldi, Asda and the Cooperative about the impending vegetable shortages, and knew early on we had a ""big problem""

A month before veg started disappearing from British supermarket shelves, Steve Cornwell walked into a greenhouse in Morocco and realised we faced an unprecedented crisis.

The farmer, whose business supplies salad to chains like Aldi, Asda and the Cooperative, was visiting a site where tomatoes are normally ripe and ready for picking in January.

""I was gobsmacked,"" says Steve, owner of MBJSC Produce in Waltham Abbey, Essex.

""Everything was green. Any other year you'd see it full of coloured fruit. You can't harvest green tomatoes. You pick them when they're breaking colour and I could see they were weeks away from that. I knew we had a big problem.""

It was the same all over Southern Europe, where during the winter Steve and wife Morna source supplies of everything from cucumbers to peppers.

But this year an unseasonal hot spell then an even more unusual cold spell has thrown production into chaos. He says: ""Normally, you can trust the temperatures in Spain, Greece, Crete and Morocco. Between 12C and 15C at night and in the 20Cs in the day. But when I was there they were as low as 4C overnight. Most crops were not colouring up.

""Unusually warm weather from October to December meant crops matured quicker and had to be harvested earlier. So a lot of the winter crop had already gone by the time the temperature dropped, then we went from one extreme to the other.

""In Spain it had even snowed and they had lost crop. The temperature is so low in Morocco the bees supposed to pollinate the tomato plants aren't coming out of their boxes. In 50 years in the business it was the worst I'd ever known it.""

Steve says he tried to warn the supermarkets they would need to be prepared to pay more for produce or face shortages - but claims they refused to listen, adding: ""I think they thought it was never going to happen.""

He says stores are now calling him, desperate to fill empty shelves. ""One supermarket rang this morning asking for round tomatoes and offering the price that last month they said they couldn't pay. If they had listened then, there wouldn't be empty shelves. That delay meant the product went to European supermarkets instead.""

Yesterday, Lidl became the latest supermarket to limit sales of certain fruit and veg, like tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers.

It follows similar moves from Aldi, Tesco, Asda and Morrisons - all retailers Steve and Morna, whose firm is part of the Lea Valley Growers' Association, supplies.

Aldi and Tesco are limiting items to three per customer, while Morrisons is letting shoppers buy two each. Failing to tackle the crisis, Environment Secretary Therese Coffey was ridiculed last week after suggesting people should ""cherish"" turnips - which are not even in season now.

Steve and Morna know more than anyone about what is causing the shortages - as well as growing some of their own produce, they import from Europe to fulfil their contracts.

In normal years, their packing house works 12 hours a day, sending out 36,000 packs of cherry tomatoes alone. But this week their 40 staff are only working four hours a day due to the lack of produce arriving.

Morna says: ""Last year there was a brief shortage of round tomatoes but this year it's all the tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, cucumbers, peppers, all the salad lines.""

And it's not just due to the bad weather. Mona explains: ""It's compounded by all sorts of issues. In Europe, supermarkets set prices weekly, so if the market is short they'll pay the higher prices.

But British supermarkets still insist on setting a price for the whole season and then are reluctant to increase them, so they end up missing out on the produce.""

Morna says Brexit has also fuelled the crisis. ""Transport companies don't want to come to the UK because of all the paperwork and logistics, the visas they need for all their drivers.

On top of that, our growers in Morocco have to pay a 3.5% duty on imports to the UK, which in July will rise to 5.7%. Yet to send their produce to the EU in the winter they don't pay any duty.""

The biggest threat to growers like Steve and Morna, though, has been the huge hikes in energy prices. The cost of keeping gas boilers going to heat their four cucumber nurseries has risen threefold since last year.

It meant that this year, they planted a month later to save costs - and as a result there is still no sign of cucumbers on their plants.

Steve says: ""We used to plant the second week in January, it was a gamble we could take as the energy costs were kinder. But this year we couldn't risk it. Everything has gone up, transport costs, diesel, packaging. It's just become untenable unless you get increases in your values.""

Others, however, have been hit even harder. In the Lea Valley, once known as the UK's cucumber capital, 20 of the 80 growers in the association have shut completely. Among them are two brothers who until last year supplied cucumbers to Steve and Mona.

The brothers, who do not want to be named, knew they would not last when oil and electricity prices soared.

One says: ""This time of year you have to put 20,000 litres of oil in the heaters. And prices got so high that meant £20,000 a week in oil alone. Electricity has also risen four times what it was. We didn't know if supermarkets would pay a much higher price, so it just wasn't worth the risk.

""It's depressing, after all these years knowing we can't make a living here.

""I've been doing this since 1977, I've gone from doing something to not knowing what I'm going to do.""

Steve warns we risk sleepwalking into a food supply catastrophe if the Government fails to support farmers.

He says: ""We don't feel growers get enough support. In fact, I don't think the Government thinks about the industry at all, until times like this when the horse has already bolted.

""Like the supermarkets, they think these problems will go away. But they won't, it will get worse. In European countries, governments support their food growers, they provide subsidies, help with energy bills. They treat it like a serious industry. That's what we want from our Government.""

27,"Image shows mythical bloodsucking creature after spate of livestock deaths","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/image-shows-mythical-bloodsucking-creature-30176625","Image shows mythical bloodsucking creature after spate of livestock deaths

Villagers in the Bolivian city of Oruro have blamed a recent spate of animal deaths on the mythical creature known as the chupacabra after finding the carcasses emptied of blood

A mythical creature similar to vampires which kill animals by sucking their blood dry is feared to have slain a number of livestock.

Drone footage in the Bolivian city of Oruro seems to show a dark, two-legged creature walking across an open field.

The hunched figure was filmed shortly after several cows, llamas and alpacas, were found dead in the area.

The animals' strange wounds prompted many locals to believe it was the work of chupacabra, a mythical creature also known as the Goat-Sucker.

The demon-like creature is said to drink the blood of livestock, according to legend, and locals fear it was responsible owing to the injuries on the animal's necks.

In response, local farmers have reportedly erected fences around their livestock to keep the figure away.

It is unknown if the authorities are looking into the claims the mythical creature drank the blood of the local livestock.

Last month, a Chupacabra was blamed for the death of a ram in Mexico.

The dead animal was found in the rural village of Leona Vicario, about 25 miles west of the Mexican resort of CancÃºn.

The lifeless white ram was found lying on a rock on the ground with wounds to its neck, mouth and eyes.

Despite some residents believing a wild cat could have caused the animal's death, many attributed it to the Goat-Sucker due to the mysterious bite marks on its neck.

Elvira said: ""Jaguarundis usually eat the soft parts, the eyes and the tongue.

""It may have been that animal or another one acting similar.""

Another local added: ""It reminds me of a documentary about the explorers who disappeared and when they were found they were missing eyes and their tongue.""

Abdiel remarked: ""In my village, we've been told for years that it is a night bird that feeds on the brain mass of animals. In my village, we know it as the Xnuc.""

The creatures were first reported in 1995, in Puerto Rico, when locals blamed it for the deaths of domestic animals such as goats and sheep.

They were drained of all their blood and reports described it as a ""large reptilian kangaroo"" with large red eyes.

Other animal deaths in the likes of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil,Chile, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico and the United States were also blamed on the chupacabra

They were later linked to the deaths of around 150 animals in the 1970s in Mexico.

As cows are named the deadliest animal in the UK, it was revealed that 30 were killed by cows in four years. These figures have been rising and look to continue to soar.

As the UK's deadliest animal, cows attack between three and four thousand people every year.

An expert has revealed this figure may continue to rise. Between 2018 and 2022, more than 30 people were killed by cows, according to the UK Government's Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The news comes after a woman died after being trampled by a herd of cows in Wales on September 1. Previously experts have called for new laws to protect the public from ""killer cows"", claiming an increase in aggressive behaviour by cattle.

David Clarke of Cattle on Walkers Safety (COWS) told the Daily Star: ""Death figures vary year to year and there are often spikes, a few years back there were three deaths in a short space of months. Also, deaths can be distinguished between farmers and members of the public, usually about three times more farmers are killed than the public.

""Long-term fatalities are about five a year. On a low number, any increase is significant. But there does seem a trend upward. Also, remember deaths are just the extreme result of lots of attacks/incidents. I suspect three to four thousand a year but nobody knows, with consequences ranging from lucky escape, trauma, minor injuries and progressively more serious injuries to deaths.

""About 35% of incidents lead to injury, just a matter of luck and circumstances. A recent HSE paper indicated 25% of farmers are injured every year by their cattle. As for carrying sticks, walking confidently through a herd or shouting commands, all nonsense recommended by armchair experts who have never been attacked, such things don't survive a one tonne animal let alone a herd of 25 cows plus calves plus bull which ran over me several times.""

A man was killed and his wife was left paralysed when they were trampled by a herd of cows while walking their daughter's whippets in September 2020. Micheal Holmes, 57, was pronounced dead at the scene while his wife Teresa was airlifted to hospital. The couple were attacked after they were trampled 20 feet from the end of the footpath in a public right-of-way field.

Micheal suffered 35 rib fractures and the sack of his heart was lacerated, a pathologist ruled the injuries to his chest on their own were not survivable. Teresa, who was knocked unconscious in the incident, suffered injuries, which included spinal fractures, spinal cord injuries and fractured ribs.

In another incident, pensioner Huw Evans was ""attacked"" and killed by a cow, which had escaped from the Whitland Mart livestock market in Carmarthenshire, Wales. He was injured in the centre of the town on November 19 last year and airlifted to hospital, but sadly he died six days later.

In a statement, his family said: ""Huw was a loved dad, dad, brother, uncle, and friend to many. We would like to thank the community for their support and well wishes while Huw was in hospital and since his passing. We now know how much he will be missed.""

Marian Clode was also attacked and flipped over a fence ""like a ragdoll"" after a stampeding cow broke loose from a holding pen in 2020. The 61-year-old primary school teacher was on a public bridleway when the cow hit her three times, causing injuries that proved fatal.

The inquest at Newcastle Coroners Court heard Marian had been on holiday with her husband Christopher, daughter Lucy, son-in-law Kevin and two grandchildren, aged seven and eight.

Kathryne McKellar from Macclesfield was also trampled to death while walking her dog Archie through a field. The 74-year-old was on holiday in Clitheroe in September 2022 when she was set attacked.

Archie returned to the holiday home without her, prompting a search which led to the discovery of her body. It is understood that 25 calves, 26 cows, and one bull were in the field at the time of the attack.

A 77-year-old man died after he was attacked by a newly calved cow on the farm where he lived in 2021. Patrick Geraghty was checking on the cow when it charged at him, leaving him seriously injured. He was airlifted to hospital but tragically died sometime later.

Derek Roan died in hospital after a horror incident involving livestock at his family farm near Dalbeattie, Dumfries and Galloway in 2022. The 71-year-old, who had previously featured in a documentary series about farming, was injured by one of his own cows. He was taken to hospital but succumbed to his injuries.

Malcolm Flynn from Carlisle was seriously injured and later died after a heard of charging cows attacked while he was walking with a friend in 2020. The 72-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene from the injuries he sustained.

His death came 10 days after Dave Clark died during a similar incident in North Yorkshire. The school teacher was charged by a single cow while jogging with his dogs through farmland.

There have also been several cases where Brits have sustained severe injuries but have managed to survive the stampedes.

Including Shirley McKaskie who was left brain damage and confined to a wheelchair after the 40-strong herd charged her as she used a public footpath to cut across a field near her home. Sharon Eley was surrounded by 20 cows who head butted in a brutal attack in the Lancashire countryside

She was left with 15 broken ribs, a punctured lung, a dislocated and shattered ankle and a broken clavicle. The 51-year-old was also nearly garrotted by the strap on her bag after it wrapped around her neck causing ligature marks and severe bruising.

Janicke Tvedt, 55, had been walking her eight-year-old Labrador Goose with her partner David Hood, 57, when they stumbled across a 30-strong herd of cows in Masham, North Yorkshire. The former army officer was left with life-changing injuries and thought she was going to die as she was trampled by the dogs.

Advising people on how to stay safe, David Clarke of COWS warned walkers to stay out of fields containing cattle all together.

He said: ""Keep out of fields with cattle, they are unpredictable, even cattle thought to be docile. Dogs used to be blamed, particularly when calves are involved, but even now the HSE figures do not support that, as many get attacked without dogs. Dogs and calves seem to be a convenient excuse so as to pretend something is being done and the problem is understood.""

A HSE spokesperson told The Daily Star: ""All large animals can be a risk to people. Even a gentle knock from a cow can result in people being crushed or falling. All cattle should be treated with respect.""

Police have told people to watch out for 'aggressive' cows and avoid walking through fields with livestock when possible after a shock cattle attack left two dog walkers in hospital

Police have issued a warning after two women charged at by ""aggressive"" cows were left in hospital.

Officers said the cows recently had calves, making them suspicious of passing walkers and dogs.

The attack took place in the village of Yoxall, Staffordshire on Friday November 24 - and is only the latest in a string of similar cattle-related encounters across the UK this year.

Despite the two injured women having their dogs on a lead at all times, the cows charged at them, reports Stoke on Trent Live, resulting in them needing hospital treatment.

Neither of the women's injuries are believed to be life-threatening, Staffordshire Policesaid - but the force commented the attack serves as an important reminder for people to take care around livestock. PC Shonei Procter, who dealt with the incident, said: ""It can be common for cows and livestock who have recently given birth to become aggressive and reactive to people and animals nearby, which can put people at risk of serious harm. Dogs should be kept on a lead and under control at all times when near livestock, and where possible, people should avoid taking routes which go through fields with animals inside.""

In September, a man was airlifted to hospital after he and two women were attacked by a herd of cows at a remote beauty spot. The 56-year-old man and two women were trampled by a herd of cows at Traigh Eais beach on Barra, in Scotland. The alarm was raised at around 8pm on Saturday when Police, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, and Barra Coastguard Rescue Team sped to their aid.

Cow attacks can also be fatal. A total of 109 people have died in incidents involving cattle in the UK over the last 21 years, according to an analysis of Health and Safety Executive data by the Cattle on Walkers Safety (COWS) group. One in five deaths were members of the public, with the rest of the fatalities involving farm workers. COWS campaigner Mr Clarke believes the number of near-misses could be in the thousands.

Huw Evans, a 75-year-old retired council worker, had been crossing the road in the centre of Whitland, Carmarthenshire, when an 'extremely agitated' cow attacked him

A man died whilst crossing the road after he was attacked by an ""agitated"" cow that had recently escaped from a nearby livestock market.

Huw Evans had been crossing the road in the centre of Whitland, Carmarthenshire, around 10.15am on November 19 last year when the shocking incident unfolded, an inquest heard. The 75-year-old retired council worker was confronted and attacked by an ""extremely agitated! Cow that had escaped from Whitland Mart. It inflicted multiple injuries on the beloved grandfather and father.

Mr Evans had to be airlifted to hospital. But despite the best efforts of medics at the University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff, he died on November 25. An inquest into his death took place before Paul Bennett, acting senior coroner for Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire, at Llanelli Town Hall on Wednesday.

Following Mr Evans' death, his family issued a tribute through Dyfed-Powys Police. They said: ""Huw was a loved dad, dadcu, brother, uncle and friend to many. We would like to thank the community for their support and well wishes while Huw was in hospital and since his passing, we now know how much he will be missed.""

The cow, a brown Limousin breed, had escaped whilst it was being unloaded from a trailer at Whitland Mart. It bent a gate to get out, and then employees made repeated attempts to get it back in - leading to one being ""thrown"" onto a car by the cow. A livestock market, operated by JJ Morris Auctioneers, had been due to take place that day.

The escaped livestock animal ran down the main road into the centre of Whitland, a short distance away. It was here that it viciously attacked Mr Evans despite repeated attempts by people to contain it. Trains were stopped when the animal made its way onto rail track in the area, before it was put down in a nearby field.

Jurors concluded: ""Following an incident which occurred on November 19 2022, on North Road, Whitland, Mr Evans was admitted to University Hospital of Wales Cardiff with injuries sustained from being trampled by a cow which had escaped from Whitland Mart and travelled along a route which did not have a cattle grid installed. Mr Evans later died at the hospital on November 25 at 8pm.""

The jury said Mr Evans' death was caused by pneumonia, multiple rib fractures, trample injuries sustained from a cow, severe mitral regurgitation, renal failure and frailty of old age.

During the inquest, statements were read from witnesses including Paula Wilson, the farmer who owned the cow which was nine years old. She said the cow ""wasn't distressed"" when it was loaded into the transport to the market and had calmly loaded, though had previously been protective of her calves earlier in the year.

Mrs Wilson described how the cow escaped while being unloaded from the vehicle by drovers, people who herd and manage livestock at the market. The farmer told the inquest she was ""very upset"" about what had happened to Mr Evans and to the cow, which was shot by police.

Elgan Rees Williams, a drover with 36 years of experience, described how the cow ""went wild"" as he and colleague Gordon Silwyn George were preparing to unload it. He told the hearing: ""She just pushed the gate, bent the gate and flew out. She ran out straight for the road. We tried to stop her, there were three or four of us by then.""

Mr Williams described how they followed the cow into Whitland and tried to shut it into the fire station yard but it escaped through a back gate before attacking Mr Evans. He confirmed he had never experienced a cow acting in that manner in his many years of droving.

The inquest heard Mr George was thrown onto the back of a pick-up truck by the cow as he attempted to stop it from running onto the main road. Sian Murrow, also a drover, said the cow ran towards the Co-op store in Whitland after escaping from the fire station yard. ""We saw the cow running towards our direction with its head down as if it was going to charge us,"" he said.

""We ran back to avoid getting struck by the cow. I saw an elderly man crossing the road. At this point, the male was halfway across the road. I witnessed the cow going towards him. I would describe the cow as being large, brown-red. It was in an extremely agitated state from the beginning to end.""

Finley Harrison, from the Health and Safety Executive, said Whitland Mart had been served a formal notice to install a cattle grid following the incident, which it had done. ""There was full cooperation,"" Mr Harrison added.

Climate change has been blamed for the major wildfires continuing to burn in Greece and the Canary Islands today - where hundreds of firefighters have been working to tackle infernos

Major wildfires were burning in Greece today with hot, dry and windy conditions hampering the efforts of hundreds of firefighters battling the blazes which have been burning for several days.

European Union officials have blamed climate change for the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in Europe, noting that 2022 was the second-worst year for wildfire damage on record after 2017.

In Greece, authorities ordered the evacuation of two villages in the central Viotia region, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of Athens, after a forest fire broke out Monday morning. The coastguard put two patrol boats and several fishing boats and private vessels on standby in case an evacuation by sea was necessary.

Authorities said the body of a man was recovered from a sheep pen in the area under evacuation, with local media reporting the man apparently died of smoke inhalation while trying to save his livestock. In the northeast of the country near the border with Turkey, strong winds rekindled flames on several fronts in a major wildfire burning for a third day across forests and farmland near the town of Alexandroupolis.

Several homes were destroyed over the weekend. Thirteen villages were evacuated, while more than 200 firefighters, assisted by 17 water-dropping aircraft, volunteers and the armed forces were battling the fire, Deputy Fire Chief Ioannis Artopios said. Another two villages were being evacuated on the island of Evia, near Athens, where 19 French firefighters also helped fight the flames, Artopios said, noting that 65 forest fires had broken out across Greece in the previous 24 hours. Cyprus was sending two firefighting aircraft to help tackle the Alexandroupolis blaze, including four crew and five ground support staff.

With gale-force winds blowing in several parts of the country, authorities set the fire risk level in several regions, including that of the Greek capital, to ""extreme."" ""This extreme situation we are experiencing will further favor the outbreak and spread of forest fires,"" Artopios said.

Greece suffers destructive wildfires every summer, which officials say have been exacerbated by climate change. Greece's deadliest wildfire killed 104 people in 2018, in a seaside resort near Athens that residents had not been warned to evacuate. Since then, authorities have erred on the side of caution, issuing swift mass evacuation orders whenever inhabited areas are under threat.

Last month a wildfire on the resort island of Rhodes forced the evacuation of some 20,000 tourists. Days later, two air force pilots were killed when their water-dropping plane crashed while diving low to tackle a blaze on the island of Evia. Another three wildfire-related deaths have been recorded this summer.

WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES Terrifying cow attacks have left people dead, widowed and paralysed - with victims suffering devastating injuries when the livestock turn on unsuspecting walkers

Victims of stampeding cow attacks have been killed, widowed and paralysed by the farm animals, leading one survivor to call for more action to be taken.

Adam Delves lived to tell the tale when he was stampeded by cows and bullocks in Worsall, Cheshire in 2018 during a dog walk through a field - but the 38-year-old was left with shocking signs of his ordeal.

The herd of 14 raging cattle kicked and stamped on him, eventually throwing him around 5ft (1.5m) into the air and moving him into a neighbouring field.

He said at the time that he believed that they were attempting to protect their nearby calves.

Mr Delves was left unable to work for weeks after suffering agonising injuries to his back, arm, leg and ankle, with graphic photographs showing the extent of his wounds.

For another victim, a cow attack put them on a mission to change how rural land along public rights of way is signposted and set out. David Clarke, 67, was walking his border collie through the countryside back in 2014 when he was targeted by a group of 25 cows. While he has admitted that the thought of the livestock turning vengeful might at first sound ""comical"", the outcome was anything but - leaving him in hospital with life-threatening injuries.

Mr Clarke said he didn't think too much of the cows when he first spotted them at the other end of the field in North Yorkshire, and decided to walk behind to avoid disturbing them. Though at first they appeared calm, moments later the animals began ""snorting"" angrily - before beginning their mad rampage. The 25 limousin cows bolted towards them, with one of them trampling David underfoot and another running over his dog, Merlin. But as he picked up his injured pet and tried to escape, the cows - which he said weighed between 750g and a tonne - came at him again, leaving him fearing the worst.

He told the Sun: ""When I noticed that the cows were coming into me, I thought they would stop. They didn't. Before I realised it was too late. All thoughts go into your head. You think of death but you don't want to. You just wonder, when is this going to stop and how will I get out?""

Mr Clarke was taken to hospital with internal bleeding, and received emergency surgery for a lacerated liver as well as suffering severe bruising, including on his face. His dog, Merlin, sadly died. He has since set up the Cattle on Walkers Safety (COWS) campaign group, where he pushes for increased signage and safety fencing around farms.

A total of 109 people have died in incidents involving cattle in the UK over the last 21 years, according to an analysis of Health and Safety Executive data by the COWS group. One in five deaths were members of the public, with the rest of the fatalities involving farm workers. COWS campaigner Mr Clarke believes the number of near-misses could be in the thousands.

Once incident highlighted by the group is the tragic case of Michael Holmes, 57, who was pronounced dead at the scene and his wife Teresa airlifted to hospital after a cow attack three years ago during lockdown. An inquest this year heard the couple were walking their daughter's two whippets, Neville and Luna, during a lunch break when they were trampled by the animals.

Mr Holmes suffered 35 rib fractures and the sack of his heart was lacerated, the hearing was told. Teresa was meanwhile left paralysed from the attack, and now uses a wheelchair.

Another incident in 2020 saw a headteacher named Dave Clark suffer a fatal haemorrhage after he was attacked by cows on a footpath. Stella Collins from Tonbridge, Kent, was airlifted to hospital in a cow attack in the Yorkshire Dales the following year, and reported still feeling pain 14 months later.

A woman was trampled to death just this month by a herd of cows while walking her dogs along a public footpath. The woman, who has not been named, was walking the access route near Welshpool, Powys, through a field which is home to a herd of 40 cows on September 1. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is investigating the woman's death.

A spokesperson for Dyfed Powys Police said: ""We can confirm that a woman died after walking her dogs along a public access path through a field containing around 40 cows. The incident took place on the evening of September 1 in the Maesmawr area of Welshpool. Her family has been notified. The coroner and HSE have also been informed.""

Owners are urged to think twice before allowing their animals to run free in a rural environment. It comes after a series of attacks on sheep across the country

Three dogs have been shot after a series of reported incidents involving sheep being savaged, police say. It has led to a warning to pet owners to keep their dogs on a lead when walking them near livestock.

The dogs were shot in the past month after 25 sheep were killed in four separate incidents. Police in Cheshire have described ""shocking scenes"".

They are now urging pet owners to think twice before allowing their animals to run free in a rural environment. It comes after a series of incidents involving dogs and livestock across the country.

In September it was reported that two XL bully dogs killed 22 pregnant sheep in savage attack after escaping from their home in Wales. There were also reports of lambs being killed by a dog in Scotland earlier this year.

PC Jim Clark, of Cheshire Police, said: ""It is vital that you keep your dog on the lead around livestock, even if you can usually trust it to come to call. If you live in or near a farming area, you must make sure that your dog cannot escape from your property, as it may find its way onto land containing sheep. Dogs should only be released from a lead if walkers are followed or chased by cattle.

""It's better to be safe than sorry by using your lead to control your dog. This should avoid not only the devastation and financial cost to the farmer who has lost his or her sheep, but the trauma to the dog owner from their dog's actions, and the thought it could have been shot to prevent further devastation.

Liam Brown, 25, from Bournemouth, snuck onto a farm around six miles from where he lived and committed the horrific act - where he was caught by a farmer who had set up CCTV

A 25-year-old man was caught having sex with a cow after a suspicious farmer set up CCTV.

The farmer, from Burton, near Christchurch, Dorset, had grown worried his livestock were being abused and targeted. So he set up CCTV and an alarm.

Liam Brown snuck onto the farm in the dead of the night on June 12, last year, to commit the horrific act of animal cruelty. But Brown, of Grosvenor Gardens, Bournemouth, was detected by the new surveillance system and a sample of DNA taken from a calf proved the attack had taken place.

He cried in Pool Magistrate Court as he was found guilty of sexual penetration with a living animal and causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.

The Mail Online reported that the case has since been transferred to Bournemouth Crown Court for sentencing as Brown could face time in prison for his horrific abuse. Prosecuting, Charles Nightingale, said that the farm had installed alarms and surveillance system after becoming increasingly worried for the safety and wellbeing of their young livestock.

Brown had reportedly been known to the farmers since he was a youngster because members of his family had previously worked there. The newly installed surveillance system caught Brown and the family found him there. Brown had no previous convictions and has not returned to the farm since the incident.

Mr Nightingale added that the family, understandably, didn't want Brown anywhere near the farm. Defending, Harry Price-Smith agreed that the case should be sent to the crown court for sentencing. The defendant was given unconditional bail.

The magistrates said: ""It is going to crown court because the offences are so serious it is possible you [Brown] need greater punishment than we can give.""

The sentencing will take place on September 22.

WARNING DISTRESSING IMAGES: Police believe the newborn lambs, who were just a matter of hours old, were attacked by at least one dog at Blairadam Farm in Kelty on Monday

A farmer was left devastated after discovering 16 of his newborn lambs had been slaughtered by a dog in a night of total 'carnage'.

Police believe the newborn lambs, who were just a matter of hours old, were attacked by at least one dog at Blairadam Farm in Kelty on Monday between 10.30am and 1.30pm.

Farmer Stuart McDougall, 43, described the 'hellish' scene which he encountered with his two young daughters who have been left traumatised, reports the Daily Record.

""There were lambs that were still walking around disembowelled with their guts hanging out,"" he said. ""I've never seen anything like it.

""They had broken legs, lacerations all over their bodies, their chest cavities had been crushed, and they had been separated from their mothers. Six were killed outright but 10 had to be put down. We're expecting more to die in the coming days if they get infections.

""The oldest ones there were three days old, some were just literally 24-hours old. It's just horrendous.

""The emotional devastation it has caused the farm and us is just huge. I never slept a wink last night and my youngest was up through the night crying.

""Every time I've went to the lambs and the mother's with my sheepdog they just go into meltdown as they're that traumatised.""

Stuart rents his land and has a farm of 400 sheep, which is right beside Blairadam Forrest. He lambs pedigrees that are then sold for breeding. The estimated value of the damage is around £7000 so far.

""There was an incident 8 years ago where my lambs were attacked by a dog, but it was nothing like this and the owner took responsibility,"" he continued.

""This was such a frenzied attack, they've just gone from one lamb to the next. From the evidence we have from the vet, it's a large dog that's injured them.

""The dog has mauled them to death and the owner has just cleared off. How could you do that? They should be ashamed and appalled with themselves.

""I have no problem with people enjoying the outdoors but they are responsible for their pets and wildlife and livestock around them.

""This is our livelihood, I have no other form of income due to a spinal injury a couple of years ago. It's all we have.""

Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward who may have been in the area which is a popular walking route.

Inspector Stephen Gray said: ""Enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances of the incident and we are appealing to anyone with information to come forward.

""The lambing season has started and worrying can cause stress to sheep that can result in them losing their lambs, as well as injuries that can lead to their death.

""All of this is at considerable cost to farmers.

""Dog owners could face prosecution if their dog attacks livestock so we are urging them to keep dogs on a lead when walking near livestock as well as making sure they do not run or escape into fields on their own.

""I am asking all dog owners to be considerate. Please remember that it is your dog and your responsibility to keep them under control.""

Chief superintendent, Mike Flynn, said: ""We are very saddened to hear about the death of 16 lambs after a dog attack in Fife. This was a terrible incident which caused tremendous suffering.

""We always try to remind people that lambs and calves are being born at this time of year and the public should keep their distance. Getting too close to cows and sheep can cause them to panic, resulting in injuries or even miscarriages for pregnant mothers.

""Please, if you are near farm land, keep your dog on a lead. No matter how obedient you believe them to be, animals can surprise us and change their mind on a whim.

""Livestock worrying is a crime and attacks are the dog owner's responsibility, resulting in fines of up to £40k or 12 months in prison. If you spot any livestock worrying then please report this to Police Scotland.

""If we take responsibility for the actions of ourselves and our pets and respect farmers' land then these tragic attacks can be avoided.""

Anyone with any information, is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1580 of Monday, 3 April, 2023.

WARNING: DISTURBING DETAILS Liam Brown, 25, was caught 'clearly having sex' with a cow by a farmer who set a trap after he suspected his animals were being interfered in Dorset

An ""ashamed and embarrassed"" man was caught with his trousers down and having sex with a cow by a suspicious farmer.

Liam Brown, 25, snuck into the cowshed in the middle of the night to commit the disturbing act but was detected by the farm's surveillance equipment. Farmer Ian Farwell caught him with his hands placed either side of a calf and his trousers down. When he tried to flee he landed in another cow pen and was trampled by several animals and caught. A DNA sample taken from the calf proved sexual intercourse had taken place on June 12 last year in Burton, Dorset.

Brown, of Bournemouth, admitted the offence and felt 'shame and embarrassment'. He was ordered to pay Mr Farwell £600 compensation by a judge who called it a ""very alarming, bizarre and worrying case.""

The court heard how Mr Farwell suspected his cows were being ""interfered with"" for some time as there had been a number of suspicious incidents before. They had found surgical gloves and items of clothing left behind and several young calves had died in unexplained circumstances.

He and his wife Tracey, son Ralph and daughter Emily devised a plan to catch the offender and installed CCTV and in June the equipment showed there was someone in the barn. In a victim impact statement, the farmer said: ""The calves would suddenly come down with injuries and a change in behaviour with no apparent reason. I knew something was not right but could not work out what was going on.

""Calves were becoming poorly and dying for no apparent reason. We had a well-trusted supplier but made demands on them to make checks. But it was due to the unthinkable actions of the defendant.

""The animals are really important to me, seeing them distressed was soul-destroying. It put a real strain on the family, we all blamed each other but the truth was something we could not comprehend.""

Matthew Mortimer, prosecuting, said: ""CCTV was installed due to the frequency of the incidents and the family devised a plan as to what to do if someone was caught in the act, they would assemble surrounding the gates to ensure they could not escape then flick on the light. They believed they may only get one shot.

""When a cow is distressed it makes quite a distinctive noise. At 11.45pm on June 12 Ralph awoke hearing a calf making that distinctive noise. He went to get reception on his phone, viewed the CCTV and saw a figure chasing a calf with what looked like a belt in his hand.

""He called his dad and told him he was there. Emily and Ian Farwell moved to cover the entrance to the parlour. Emily saw the defendant with both arms around the animal and his trousers slightly lowered. She turned the light on. They saw the male figure's hips moving back and forward, clearly having sex with the animal.""

Brown pleaded guilty to sexual penetration with a living animal and causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. The court heard he had no previous convictions and shown genuine remorse.

Olivia McGonigle, defending, said: ""He doesn't live anywhere near the farm and has no intention of working with livestock. He is living with his mother, but there is the possibility of him moving in with his girlfriend, who has been a very supportive person. He has expressed how remorseful he is. He is distressed by the pain he has caused.""

She said Brown had no qualifications but was working with an agency and had been doing night shifts stacking shelves. Judge Keith Cutler sentenced him to a three-year community order with rehabilitation requirements and 150 hours of unpaid work and ordered him to pay £600 compensation to the Farwells. He also made a disqualification order, preventing him from keeping livestock for ten years.

Judge Cutler said: ""This is a very alarming, bizarre and worrying case. I am sure you will look back on it not only with shame and embarrassment but also with the resolve this will never happen again. Your actions did cause unnecessary suffering and distress to these animals.""

Ann Widdecombe's advice not ""to do the cheese sandwich"" if families can't afford bread and cheese is unhelpful and patronising, argues columnist Rachael Bletchly

This week, I have mostly been eating cucumbers.

I popped to my local market on Monday and a stall holder was selling eight for a quid, or 12.5p each.

And, as I can't resist a bargain, I got three bags and started experimenting. So, far I've had Greek salad, tzatziki and cucumber raita.

I've also pickled some, made healthy salt and vinegar ""crisps"" (disgusting) and knocked up a chilled cucumber soup, which tasted like a face pack.

But my favourite way of eating cucumber is still thinly sliced in a red Leicester cheese sandwich made with processed white bread.

Although that rather negates my salad savings, as cutting a basic cheese butty at home will now set you back 40p.

And with food inflation at a 45-year high of 19.1%, many hard-up families are finding their picnic planning is ­seriously hampered.

But why should we expect such extravagant mealtimes anyway? Families do not have a ""right"" to cheap food, according to one former Tory Minister. Ann ""Marie Antoinette"" Widdecome reckons, if you can't afford bread and cheese : ""Well, then, you don't do the cheese sandwich.""

You could stick to beans on toast, of course. And as Tory MP Brendan Clarke-Smith helpfully explained, ""if a Heinz tin has gone up by 50% or whatever, well, buy the Tesco Value one"". Genius! Out-of-touch politicians have no idea how ordinary people are struggling to feed their families.

And British food producers say the Government is not protecting their interests either. In the Lea Valley it costs salad farmers 30p to produce a cucumber. But European growers are overproducing, to make up for the bad weather in February, and selling theirs to UK wholesalers for 16p or less.

Greedy supermarkets then flog the foreign imports for 79p each while 30% of the Lea Valley harvest gets dumped every day. Others end up on cut-price market stalls - and in my kitchen.

And while I'm selfishly gratified to nab a bargain, I agree with Lea Valley Growers Association spokesman Lee Stiles that this ""seems like madness"".

Why isn't the Government protecting domestic growers and sorting out the chaotic UK food system? This week, Rishi Sunak hosted a ""farm to fork"" summit at No10 for farmers and supermarket bosses. But attendees said that there had been no discussion of soaring food prices or ­agriculture subsidies.

Instead, the PM seemed far more ­interested in posing for Instagram shots with Clarkson's Farm star Kaleb Cooper.

Food inflation is out of control and families can no longer afford the basics.

So the Government must take its cues from the experts. And get a forking grip.

A review of ultra-processed food (UPF), high in salt and sugar and used in popular snacks, found they raise cardiovascular risks by 24%, while 60% of the average UK diet is made up of UPFs

More than half of the British diet is linked to heart attacks and strokes, experts warn.

A review of ultra-processed food, high in salt and sugar and used in popular snacks, found they raise cardiovascular risks by 24%.

It comes as the Mirror reveals healthy, fresh produce is almost impossible to find in poorer areas.

Leon founder Henry Dimbleby said: ""This should be a wake up call.

""If there is something inherent in the processing of foods that is harmful, then that is a disaster.

""Britain is particularly bad for ultra-processed food.

""It is storing up problems for the future. If we do nothing, a tidal wave of harm will hit the NHS.""

UPFs make up 60% of the average UK diet. Only the US consumes more.

UPFs include most supermarket bread as well as shop-bought sandwiches, soups and crisps and are often high in salt and sugar.

""They have unhealthy artificial additives to boost flavour and shelf life including sweeteners, dyes and bulking agents.

These are mostly not used in home cooking but are cheaper in mass produced food.

UPFs are often low in fibre and lack the nutrients present in fresh foods such fruit and vegetables and homemade bread.

British Heart Foundation medical director Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan said: ""There is increasing concern about links shown between UPFs and cardiovascular disease.

""We don't know to what degree this is driven by artificial additives or the high levels of salt, sugar and fat these foods tend to contain.""

Mr Dimbleby was hired by the Tories to conduct an independent review of the food system.

But he quit in March after ministers refused to act on his many recommendations.

Mr Dimbleby added: ""We need a shift in our cooking habits to eat more food cooked from scratch, with more vegetables and fibre.

""That is really hard in practice, it requires a huge cultural shift.""

The finding came in a review of 10 studies involving 325,000 people being presented at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Amsterdam.

A second study of 10,000 middle aged Australian women showed those who ate more UPFs were 39% more likely to develop high blood pressure.

The Department of Health and Social Care said: ""We have introduced legislation to restrict the placement and promotion of certain products in supermarkets to discourage unhealthy choices.""

A small food shop near Liverpool can barely serve the needs of almost 11,500 residents and the nearby Asda is three miles away, which is poorly served by local bus routes

Searching for fresh fruit and veg in a small food shop serving nearly 11,500 villagers, all I can find are a few packs of frozen broccoli, mixed greens and cauliflower. Fresh produce is nowhere to be found.

To buy that I would need to visit the nearest supermarket, an Asda three miles away poorly served by local bus routes, making it hard to access for the thousands of residents without a car.

Welcome to Knowsley, one of the country's worst ""food deserts"".

More than half of the average UK diet is made up of ultra-processed food and it's proven particularly hard to change that for residents of the area.

Some 77% of locals of the borough, just under nine miles from Liverpool city centre, have limited access to affordable nutritious food.

As many as 48% of residents in some parts of the borough do not have a car, according to the 2021 census, meaning they rely more on local services.

Of course the lack of fresh produce is not the fault of small shops doing their best to stay afloat.

Profit margins are generally small, and with rising bills and the increasing cost of buying from farmers and wholesalers, it can be a costly risk to fill shops with food that has a short shelf life.

In 2018 the Social Market Foundation estimated 10.2 million people were living in food ""deserts"", and this has worsened in the cost of living crisis.

Only one in 10 British children and one third of adults are eating enough fruit and vegetables, Food Foundation research found this year. It found healthier foods cost nearly three times as much as less nutritious choices.

Campaigner Henry Dimbleby said this all adds up to a desperate situation for more deprived areas.

The businessman, who quit as the Government's food tsar in March over its inaction against obesity, added: ""Food insecurity and obesity are both on the increase.

""The poorest neighbourhoods have the most junk food available, as it's the easiest way to feed your family cheaply.

""People know what they should be eating. They just find it incredibly difficult on tight budgets to find that healthy food and feed their families.

""However, the Government has been hopelessly slow to get a grip on it. But if we don't, whoever is in power in 10 years' time is going to be crippled by the problems our food system causes.

""It is by far the biggest cause of avoidable disease and early death and it is the biggest drag on the economy.""

He said the official £6.5billion cost of obesity to the NHS is an underestimate.

""It doesn't take into account the health problems caused by poor diets in people who aren't obese,"" he said.

""There's also a bigger, hidden cost to the economy because the major causes of why people are out of work due to long-term sickness are musculoskeletal conditions, type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, as well as mental health problems.

""Food is the primary cause of those first three things, while it massively exacerbates mental health. If nothing changes we will get sicker and sicker, GDP will stagnate and we will be left in a terrible position.""

Food deserts are more likely to be inhabited by low-income residents with poor access to transport, making them less attractive markets for big supermarket chains.

Instead, the areas are home to smaller convenience stores which tend to be more expensive and less likely to stock fresh and healthier items.

Mr Dimbleby's book Ravenous, co-written with his wife Jemima Lewis, says 3.3 million people live in an area where there are no shops selling fresh ingredients within 15 minutes by public transport.

One Knowsley resident, who did not want to be named, told me: ""There's nothing round here. We desperately need a small local or express store, but the supermarkets don't want to come.""

Dr Naomi Maynard of Feeding Liverpool said: ""We often get asked, ""˜Why don't people just shop online?'.

""But we have quite low levels of digital access and there's often a delivery charge and a minimum spend.

""Low-income households don't shop in that way. They'd never spend £50 on food all at once.""

Community groups have stepped in to ensure residents can get nutritious food. Five days a week, greengrocer Paul Flannery takes his Queen of Greens van to the worst-affected areas of Liverpool and Knowsley. Affiliated with Feeding Liverpool and its partner charity Global Feedback, the scheme brings affordable fruit and vegetables to customers who can use vouchers such as Healthy Start cards.

And at the nearby Hillside Neighbourhood Centre residents can pay £3.50 for 10 items, including fresh fruit and veg, meat and staples such as rice and pasta at the Grub Hub.

One regular at the Grub Hub is retired lorry driver James Kennedy, 86.

He said: ""This is a godsend. Without this, I would be dead, simple as that.""

Margaret O'Mara, who is a volunteer with the Grub Hub, added: ""I never thought this would be the UK in 2023. It's Dickensian.

""At least here, we are offering people the chance to cook their families good, nutritious meals economically.""

Meet those in the know

CAMPAIGNER Henry Dimbleby, Leon founder

""People know what they should be eating. If you look at polling where people are asked ""˜what is a good diet', 95% know what that looks like. They just find it incredibly difficult on tight budgets to find that healthy food and feed their families.""

PARENT Dominic Watters, Single parent from Canterbury, Kent

""The shop on my estate only sells the lowest-quality foods and nothing fresh. The lack of access to nutrition mirrors the other lack of access we have to resources - our aspirations are very much dimmed by the environments we live in.""

EXPERT Dr Hillary Shaw De Montfort University

""Deprivation has continued because people in these areas don't have the money to buy healthy food or for transport to get to these shops.""

Chiefs from major supermarket chains are expected to meet with Food Minister Mark Spencer to discuss lessons learned from the crisis, and explain how it happened

Supermarket bosses are set to be hauled in by the Food Minister to explain shortages of fruit and veg products for customers across the UK.

It comes after Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Aldi were forced to put limits on the number of items customers were allowed to buy,

Today former Environment Secretary George Eustice warned that the shortages are likely to go on for another ""three to four weeks"".

Chiefs from major supermarket chains are expected to meet with Food Minister Mark Spencer to discuss lessons learned from the crisis, and explain how it happened.

It comes as chef Thomasina Miers, who runs the Wahaca chain of restaurants, sounded an ominous warning, describing the UK's food system as ""completely broken"" and stating: ""There's a time bomb we're sitting on.""

She continued: ""If we think cucumbers and tomatoes are bad, we are looking at way worse in the next decade.""

Tesco and Aldi are limiting customers to three units of tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers as a precautionary measure, while Asda is also limiting customers on lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflower and raspberries.

And Morrisons has set a limit of two items per customer across tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and peppers.

Mr Eustice claimed there wasn't much different the government could have done, but told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: ""We're going to have three or four weeks of this and the supermarkets have got to work to get it right.

""Longer term that there are things we should be doing.""

Retailers say the problems stem from poor yields on the continent and north Africa, and that supplies will improve in the coming days or weeks.

And an unnamed supermarket executive told the Mail on Sunday: ""˜Supply chains are run as 'just in time'.

""To stop it spoiling, we get produce just in time for it to go on shelves and be sold. Any hiccupand shelves look empty.""

Last week Environment Secretary Therese Coffey suggested in the House of Commons that people could get around the shortages by eating turnips instead.

She said: 'It's important to make sure that we cherish the specialisms that we have in this country.

""A lot of people would be eating turnips right now rather than thinking necessarily about... lettuce and tomatoes and similar, but I'm conscious that consumers want a year-round choice and that is what our supermarkets, food producers and growers around the world are trying to satisfy.""

The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned that shortages of some fruit and vegetables in UK supermarkets could be ""the tip of the iceberg"".

NFU deputy president Tom Bradshaw said a reliance on imports has left the UK vulnerable to ""shock weather events"".

Mr Bradshaw told Times Radio: ""We've been warning about this moment for the past year.""

He continued: ""There's a lack of confidence from the growers that they're going to get the returns that justify planting their glasshouses, and at the moment we've got a lot of glasshouses that would be growing the tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, aubergine that are sitting there empty because they simply couldn't take the risk to plant them with the crops, not thinking they'd get the returns from the marketplace.

""And with them being completely reliant on imports - we'd always have some imports - but we've been completely reliant on imports (now). And when there's been some shock weather events in Morocco and Spain, it's meant that we've had these shortages.

""It's really interesting that before Brexit we didn't used to source anything, or very little, from Morocco but we've been forced to go further afield and now these climatic shocks becoming more prevalent have had a real impact on the food available on our shelves today.""

The majority of both prospective Labour and Conservative voters are in favour of extending eligibility immediately to all those from families receiving Universal Credit

Jamie Oliver has demanded free school meals are given to more children as research shows the majority of both Labour and Tory voters back this. The celebrity chef, who has long campaigned on child food and nutrition issues, insisted it is ""time to prioritise our children's health"".

Polling shows a whopping 82% of prospective Labour voters and more than half of prospective Conservative voters (53%) are in favour of extending eligibility immediately to all those from families receiving Universal Credit, followed by a future expansion to all school children. Mr Oliver said: ""It's great to see that voters across all parties want to put child health first. It's time to prioritise our children's health. We know that nourishing young minds with nutritious food is an investment in their future, boosts our economy and our health. Sadiq Khan has recognised this by giving all primary school children a free school meal and now we need politicians across all parties to put child health above politics and act now.""

Currently only children from households with an income below £7,400 a year after tax and benefits are eligible. This has not increased since 2018 despite prices rising and means an estimated 900,000 schoolchildren living in poverty are not eligible. Keir Starmer so far has refused to back free school meals for all primary school children. He faces calls from within the party, with leaders in London and Wales committing to the measure.

The polling, which was commissioned by the School Food Review Working Group, found 23% of 2019 Conservative voters and 18% of those who intend to vote Tory at the next election would be more likely to switch to Labour if it adopted a free school meals policy. The survey of 3,011 members also suggested almost two thirds (65%) of prospective Labour voters would be more likely to vote for the party if they committed to extending free lunches.

Anna Taylor, Executive Director of The Food Foundation, said: ""This research has an instructive new finding. People now believe that children eating well in school to support their learning is so important that it would affect which party they vote for in the next election. It's a clear signal that the status quo is both unfair and damaging, and voters want it fixed.""

Anna Garrod, Policy & Influencing Director of Impact on Urban Health, added: ""This research confirms that Free School Meals expansion is a key issue for voters and a move to support it would appeal to swing and undecided voters. We urge policymakers to take this opportunity to create a more equitable school food system across the country - to support all children to access healthy, nutritious food, and in doing so build a healthier society and more resilient economy.""

Rotten meat may have been sold in British supermarkets and could have even made its way into schools and hospitals in food like ready meals, quiches, and sandwiches

Rotten meat may have been sold in British supermarkets and is claimed to have even made its way to schools and hospitals.

The processor, which cannot be named for legal reasons, has been accused accused of mixing rotten pork in with the fresh product.

It's alleged that meat from the company ended up sold in supermarkets and the most rotten meat was said to have even reached schools, hospitals, care homes and prisons - who were indirectly supplied.

It was allegedly used up in products like ready meals, quiches and sandwiches - as none of the processor's customers were aware of its alleged practices.

Reported by Farmers Weekly, the company was also alleged to have sold up to ""tens of thousands of tonnes a week"" of foreign pork as British and is now under investigation.

The shocking practice is said to have gone on until at least the end of 2020 and for at least two decades prior.

One way they reportedly dodged auditors, was having an employee push the suspect meat around the circle-shaped factory as the auditor went round too, so they never came across it

Former employees also told the outlet that the processor would regularly ""wash"" hams that were visibly off in an attempt to pass them off as fine.

They also alleged tests which reportedly showed the meat picked up bacteria like E-Coli and Listeria were said to have been buried, and paperwork falsified.

It was reported an ex-employee claimed that EU bacon medallions were bought for £1/kg and sold on as British ones for £12/kg.

Darren Davies, head of the FSA's NFCU, said: ""The FSA's National Food Crime Unit is carrying out a criminal investigation into how a supplier was allegedly providing products labelled as British when they were in fact sourced from elsewhere.

""This is a complex and live investigation and we are looking into all new lines of enquiry with our partner organisations, including any potential food hygiene breaches at the premises. If any evidence of a food safety risk is found, then necessary action will be taken.

""The FSA advised retailers last year to check their cooked meat supply chain and to apply extra due diligence in their checks. We don't give out these alerts without a reason.

""We will not name the supplier while we painstakingly gather evidence to support our investigation so as not to prejudice any possible future action by the courts.

""As a national regulator, we are the last line of defence. At a time when cost pressures and other challenges mean the risks of food fraud might be increasing, it is vital that everyone involved in the food system remains extra vigilant to ensure that food is safe and what it says it is.""

The British Retail Consortium (BRC) issued a statement on behalf of all the affected supermarkets.

It said: ""The role of the FSA is to work with retailers to prevent fraud. While we cannot comment on an ongoing investigation, retailers will support the FSA with its investigation into the individual supplier in question.""

Norman Bagley, the group's head of Operations, said: ""Reading the response from Darren Davies, head of the Food Standard Agency's NFCU, we note that they alerted retailers, possibly via the secure Food Industry Intelligence Network (FIIN) members area in May 2022, some 5 months after first advising the FSA board about there being a live high level food fraud investigation.

""The FIIN has, according to their website, just 58 members from a supply chain of thousands of food business operators.

""It is inexcusable that food manufacturers and foodservice businesses, some of whom supply some of society's most vulnerable consumers, were not alerted at any time to date by the NFCU as to there either being a possibility of labelling fraud or of a risk to public health.""

Members of the Animal Rising protest group sat down at tables reserved for other customers at Cail Bruich in Glasgow during the high-end restaurant's evening service

A Michelin-starred restaurant was stormed by animal rights activists who claim it ""refuses to cater for vegans"".

The Animal Rising group disrupted waiters during the evening service at Cail Bruich restaurant, which starts at £140 per head.

Seven protesters allegedly sat at tables which were reserved for customers and held up placards showing conditions inside UK farms.

It's understood they stormed the high-end eatery to express their frustrations at the lack of plant-based options as well as its ""meat-heavy menu"".

Police were called to the scene at 7.30pm on Saturday where five of the activists were arrested and taken into custody, reports the Daily Record.

A protester identified as Marshall, 25, said: ""How we currently treat intelligent, feeling animals and our beautiful countryside is not reflective of who we want to be as a society.

""We can have a safe, secure food system that feeds everyone without the need to harm animals or devastate nature.

""We can do so much better than places like Cail Bruich that serve excessively expensive meals and refuse to cater for vegans in the midst of our cost of living and environmental crises.""

Other luxury restaurants were also targeted by the group including venues in Southampton, Bristol, Birmingham, Lancaster and London.

According to the group, these included Cow and Sow in Bristol, Adam's Restaurant in Birmingham, Quite simply French in Lancaster, and Blue Jasmine in Southampton.

'Sit-in' protests were also reportedly held at Salt Bae's flagship London restaurant that serves steak coated in gold costing upwards of £700 each.

A spokesperson for Animal Rising said in a tweet: ""These people taking action care deeply about animals, nature and the future of our planet.

""We must stand - or sit - together. There is strength in numbers when calling out our destructive food system and this action was six cities strong.""

Last month, the group gained attention when they protested the Grand National.

Protestors launched a petition to cancel the UK's more watched race and then tried to get onto the racecourse in Aintree, Merseyside.

The group clashed with police shortly before the scheduled start time of 5.15pm.

It led to the race being delayed and the protest group, who had signalled their intent to disrupt the steeplechase, have begun a petition to get the race cancelled.

Surrey Police confirmed the arrests were made on Saturday morning after animal rights activists confirmed their plans to halt the historic race

Police have revealed 19 people have been arrested over alleged plans to disrupt the Epsom Derby on Saturday.

Animal Rising activists announced their plans to halt the Derby earlier this week after disrupting the Grand National at Aintree in Aprill.

Officers said 11 people were arrested at separate addresses in the early hours of the morning following warrants based on intelligence received ahead of the festival. Eight people were also arrested after a vehicle stopped in Burgh Heath at about 10.20am, two miles from Epsom Downs racecourse.

All were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit public nuisance and remain in police custody. Activists from the group Animal Rising had pledged to ""cancel or severely delay"" the Derby in the lead-up to the event.

At Aintree, protestors from Animal Rising delayed the famous race by 14 minutes after scaling fences and breaking onto the course. They were blamed with unsettling horses with trainer Sandy Thompson claiming they paid a part in the death of Hill Sixteen.

The Jockey Club, who own both Epsom and Aintree, took legal action after the National and argued that protests ""compromise the safety of equine and human participants and all racegoers"".

High Court judge Sir Anthony Mann granted an injunction stating that activists who disrupted the event could be subject to proceedings for contempt of court, which may lead to a fine and/or imprisonment.

Jockey Club chief executive Nevin Truesdale pleaded earlier this week: ""I urge Animal Rising to abandon any plans to breach security at The Derby Festival and respect the legitimate right of the thousands of people who will join us at Epsom Downs and the millions of others watching at home and around the world to enjoy the sport they love uninterrupted. We will simply not tolerate a repeat of the dangerous and reckless behaviour we saw at Aintree on Grand National Day.""

The Jockey Club offered an area outside of the main gates for a peaceful protest and many campaigners were seen holding up signs on Saturday morning. However it seems any attempts to bring the racing to a halt have been thwarted.

Animal Rising claim the arrests are ""another example of how the Government is attempting to outlaw all protests and ignore critical societal issues.""

Dan Kidby, co-founder of Animal Rising said: ""We are seeing an intensive policing operation to protect the interests of a multi-billion pound industry that the majority of the public, as a nation of animal lovers, recognise as cruel to horses.

""A horse dies every other day in racing and billions of animals are killed every year in our food system. Animal Rising will not stop trying to bring these issues to the forefront of the public agenda and demand change.""

After a huge winning ticket was won at a Fred Meyer store in Washington state, the store decided to donate their cheque for selling the winning ticket to help those less fortuante

A grocery store that sold one of the largest jackpot Powerball winning tickets decided to put their reward for selling the winning ticket to amazing use.

After selling the $754.6 million (£599.2 million) jackpot-winning ticket, the fifth largest in the Powerball's history, the Fred Meyer store in Auburn, Washington received a $50,000 (£39,700) cheque from the lottery commission earlier this year. But instead of keeping the money for themselves, the store decided to be generous.

The company donated the full $50,000 to Auburn Food Bank. This donation means the food bank was able to provide around 66,000 meals, according to a joint statement from the store and foodbank.

""Hunger and food insecurity are critical issues across the state and partnerships like this one with Fred Meyer and QFC (Quality Food Centers) aim to shrink the numbers of people facing food insecurity,"" said the executive director of the Auburn Food Bank, Debbie Christian. Fred Meyer added that their decision was made in honour of their Zero Hunger Zero Waste social impact strategy.

In a statement shared by the City of Auburn's government Facebook page, Ms Christian added: ""This donation is truly remarkable. These funds will help feed tens of thousands of families across the community as we work to top our goal of feeding more than 14,000 households in 2023. With the rising cost of food nationwide, this donation will translate to much-needed assistance.""

Kroger's strategy is aimed at reducing waste and ending hunger and has seen three billion meals donated since 2017. According to Kroger, the company that owns Fred Meyer, 38 per cent of food produced in the US is thrown away - meaning 229 million tonnes of surplus food goes unsold or uneaten every year, and that's in addition to food left unharvested on farms.

Meanwhile, almost 42 million Americans, one in eight, struggle with hunger. Kroger says the social and environmental impact plan ""reflects our commitment to build a more resilient, equitable and sustainable food system that improves access to affordable, fresh food for everyone - for generations to come.""

""It's always good to give back and today everyone wins,"" Fred Meyer president Todd Kammeyer said. ""In addition to this donation, Fred Meyer is giving $10,000 to the store for our associates to celebrate.""

All the winning numbers were matched on the single ticket in Washington state for the $754.6 million jackpot in February earlier this year. The winner had the option of taking a lump sum payment of $407.2 million (£323.2 million) or having their prize paid out in annuity for the full $754.6 million.

The win, drawn on February 6, was the first Powerball jackpot win of 2023, and the first since November 19. The almost three-month streak without a win allowed the jackpot to grow larger and larger until it became the ninth-largest in US history

Former model Kelly Brook has launched her own TV show alongside her husband following in the footsteps of Jeremy Clarkson as she focuses on harvesting and trading olives

Kelly Brook has launched her own farming TV show to rival Jeremy Clarkson alongside her husband as they focus on harvesting and trading of olives.

Set in her husband Jeremy Parisi's Italian homeland, the 43 year old model turned presenter visits olive groves to learn about the process of making olive oil. Giving a sneak peek of the show, Kelly posted a few behind-the-scenes pictures of her posing in olive groves and visiting pizzerias. She captioned the snaps saying: ""Last autumn, my husband and I filmed a pilot on his family farm in Italy during the olive harvest and captured the beauty of where he is from and the beautiful family I married into.""

She added: ""We are not sure if this pilot will ever become a TV show, however, we are hoping one day it might. Arpino is where we were married and is definitely a place we will be spending more time in the future and I'm looking forward to learning more about the business of olive oil farming.""

Kelly's show could rival Jeremy Clarkson's Clarkson's Farm, detailing life on a farm in the Cotswolds. Her new venture is a far cry from what Kelly is perhaps used to presenting as she made her name fronting lads mags and then went on host the Big Breakfast in 1999, alongside Johnny Vaughn. Years later, Kelly then appeared on Strictly Come Dancing and even hosted Celebrity Love Island. Ever the professional, Kelly, who married Jeremy in 2022, went on to thank her production company Fulwell 73, which is co-run by James Corden, for helping her to bring her dream to reality

She continued: ""Thank you to Fulwell 73 for making this dream a reality and capturing so many wonderful moments on film."" The new pilot show, which has not set an air date, will mark Kelly's first attempt at hosting her own series. But while things appear to be going well for the former model it was only recently that she was embroiled in a love triangle scandal. Kelly has been accused of cheating on her ex boyfriend Thom Evans with rugby ace Danny Cipriani, during a secret romantic trip to Mauritius.

Danny and Kelly dated fot two years between 2008 and 2010 but it looks as though the pair struggled to cut off all ties if Danny's tales in his new book, Who Am I?, are to be believed. Danny claimed that he found it difficult when he found out about Kelly dating his Wasps team mate Thom. But according to Danny, he felt it was fair game to pursue Kelly, despite the model being in a committed relationship.

It was a year into Kelly's relationship with Thom in 2011 that she announced that she was pregnant with the couple's first child. But tragically, the pair lost their unborn child. And this was when Danny claimed the secret liasons started.

Danny alleged in his book: ""When she loses the baby, we secretly meet up in ­Mauritius while she's still meant to be with Thom. I know deep down it's wrong, but I'm convinced I want her back."" And he told The Sun On Sunday: ""I was friends with Thom.It was definitely a difficult scenario ""” it's like seeing your mate and your ex-girlfriend all over Facebook, but yet it's a national newspaper. The whole thing was intense. I was away in Australia, and Kelly was still messaging me. And I was so confused and torn and twisted at that time.""

Welcome to This World Talks - an offshoot of our ground-breaking Britain Talks series, but this time around readers will have the chance to sign up and meet people from all over the globe.

The screen freezes for a moment, and then a connection is made.

""Good morning!"" says Brian Ascroft, 78, from Tarleton Lancashire. ""My name is Brian.""

""Morning!"" says Mustapha Ali, a 25-year-old from Fanteakwa in Eastern Ghana. ""Call me Ali.""

Brian and Ali were born over 50 years and 5,000 miles apart, but one subject immediately unites them - tomatoes.

Within moments the two farmers are talking about soaring inflation, the cost-of-living crisis, climate change - and their love of the sweet red fruit they both make a living from.

""How did you get into tomato farming?"" Ali asks.

""With my father 70 years ago,"" Brian smiles. ""It's a family business, and it's been in the family for over 77 years. I have done nothing else all my life.""

""I'm from a farming family,"" Ali says. ""My dad is a farmer, my mum is a farmer, my entire family are farmers.""

""We are similar!"" Brian says.

Brian and Ali are the very first pair to meet via video call for the Mirror's brand-new project, The World Talks. An offshoot of our ground-breaking Britain Talks series, this time around readers will have the chance to sign up and meet people from all over the globe.

Newspaper and online audiences are taking part from a wide range of countries including Ukraine, South Korea, Brazil, Ghana, South Africa, India, Germany, Italy and Mexico - as part of an initiative by the Berlin-based My Country Talks.

Applications go live today, and the date for meeting up online is Sunday June 25th.

Back on the call, Ali is fascinated to learn that at Croftpak Nurseries, Brian's tomatoes are grown in coconut fibre in glasshouses.

""When we started, we grew - probably like you - on the soil, watered with a pipe,"" Brian says. ""Now it is all grown by computers. All the watering, ventilation and heat is controlled by technology. Our glasshouses are heated by a biomass boiler which runs on wood chip and by solar panels. Whereas presumably outside you don't need any heat, Ali? You get all the heat from the sun.""

Ali laughs. It's 32 degrees in Ghana today, more than twice that of Lancashire. ""Yeah, we get a lot of heat here,"" he says.

Ali's 10 acres of tomatoes are grown using traditional methods. His family collect rainwater, have drilled a borehole, and sometimes dam the local river.

""At this time of year our farmers go to the stream alongside the community and fetch water,"" Ali says. ""Then they manually measure 200ml of water and just put it in the hole they have created.""

Both farmers control pests using natural methods rather than harmful pesticides. Ali grows tomatoes for maximum yield.

""However, many we can grow, people always want more,"" he says. ""You can never grow too many tomatoes for people in Ghana - it's part of people's everyday food. We love tomatoes here a lot!""

Tomato is a key ingredient in the national dish, jollof rice. ""If you want to make jollof rice you have to have a lot of tomatoes so it's one of the most consumed vegetables we eat here,"" Ali says. ""But every December when the water source dries up, we normally have a shortage, so we have to walk to our methods to grow for intense flavour.

He is evangelical about a new variety, Strabena. ""It's strawberry shaped and it's really juicy. It's unbelievable. Everybody who tries it wants more.""

In 1992, Brian produced the first tomato to be harvested on the vine in Britain for Booths, the upmarket northern supermarket. He also grows for Michelin-starred restaurants.

Ali sells mostly to the market women who haggle over prices but also to some nearby eateries.

While Brian left school at 15, Ali went on to study agriculture and animal husbandry. But times for farmers are hard in both countries.

Ghana is suffering a tomato crisis thanks to inflation soaring above 50%, and deep drought caused by climate change. It is seeking a $3billion loan from the IMF to shore up its economy.

Britain is also suffering from inflation, a cost-of-living crisis, and a changing climate. ""Our biggest problems are water and the cost of inputs like the fertilisers,"" Ali says. ""Climate change is affecting us.""

He explains that when he was due to transplant seedlings in January, it didn't rain. Without money to set up irrigation, they just had sit and wait. It didn't rain until the last day of February.

""Water source is quite a problem now,"" he says. Brian says ""market conditions"" are a problem in the UK. ""Plus, the same as you were saying, input costs. Fertiliser costs have doubled in the UK.

""We were paying £10 for calcium nitrate, which goes into the irrigation system. It got as high as £22 per bag. A pallet of 40 was costing us £400, it is now costing us £880. If you cannot get a better price for your produce, you cannot continue. You can't survive.""

Brian's dad established the farm just after WWII, and Brian worked the land from the age of five. Now his two sons are carrying on the family tradition, while his daughter works in education.

""So, basically we're still a family business growing tomatoes,"" Brian says.

""Everything that's harvested here is harvested by family members. You live or die by what you produce."" Both men are passionate about their produce.

""I absolutely adore eating tomatoes,"" Brian says. ""When we're in production, I must eat several kilos a week, trying each variety.""

Ali smiles. ""I love eating tomatoes a lot,"" he says. ""There are a lot of health benefits. It even improves the eyesight. I can't stay away from them.""

After the call, Brian reflects on meeting a man so far away yet with so many things in common. ""It was an interesting chat with Ali,"" he says. ""Even though we're from the same industry, the way we operate is completely different. But we also had things in common. It was really nice to speak to a farmer from a different country who has come from a farming family and community.""

Green Bay Packers running back has responded to fans questioning why he was live streaming a farming video game in the early hour of the morning ahead of Week 6 in the NFL

Green Bay Packers running back AJ Dillon has sent a message to fans after he was discovered live-streaming a video game in the early hours of the morning.

The 25-year-old is one of the key players for the Packers offense, alongside fellow running back Aaron Jones. Dillon has entered his fourth season in Green Bay, after being drafted in the second round with the No.62 overall pick back in 2020.

Dillon has helped the Packers move to 2-3 after the opening five weeks of the 2023 NFL regular season. The most recent game was a 17-13 loss on the road to the Las Vegas Raiders on ""˜Monday Night Football'.

Even though Dillon earns his money by playing football, he enjoys playing video games in his spare time. Most notably, the running back is a fan of playing the game ""˜Farming Simulator' on his PC.

On Wednesday night, Dillon was spotted by fans live streaming on Twitch while playing the farming video game. Some fans on social media were questioning why Dillon was playing a video game in the early hours of the morning while the season is ongoing.

Dillon posted a response of his own on X, formerly known as Twitter, pointing out that Week 6 is a bye week for the Packers. Dillon and the rest of the Green Bay roster do not return to the field until October 22 in Week 7 in the road game against the Denver Broncos.

The Packers running back wrote: ""Lol first stream this season! Chat wanted to get the farm up and running during the BYE week! Most watched farm sim in the world Come check us out.""

Soon after the stream, Dillon updated his profile picture on X to include a photo of himself during the broadcast. The photo featured Dillon sitting in his chair facing the screen while wearing a cowboy hat.

Packers head coach Matt LaFleur has played Dillon in all five games so far this season. The running back has scored one rushing touchdown this season which came in the Week 5 loss to the Raiders, and has amassed a total of 194 rushing yards across 64 carries.

Dillon is second on the Packers' depth chart in the running back room, behind usual starter Jones. Dillon has stepped in for the injured Jones, who has only played two games this season due to sustaining a hamstring injury.

Will Young is set to join Winter Love Island next week, but the hunky farmer already has a claim to fame and a major social media following for his shirtless farming videos

Buckinghamshire farmer, Will Young might spend all day with pigs and sheep, but he is already a major internet sensation before he debuts in winter Love Island on Monday.

The 23-year-old is known for showcasing his farming skills, while shirtless on TikTok, especially how he raises his flock of sheep, all while also showing off his abs.

However, even with a hefty 1 million followers on the platform and another 126,000 on Instagram, Will has admitted that his line of work has left him too busy to have the time to find love.

Ahead of his entry into the villa Will said: ""Having grown up on a farm, it's been quite difficult juggling relationships and work.""

"" Love Island will give me time away from the farm to solely go out and find love. I think I'm at the time of my life where I'm mature enough to go and find a wife.""

Will lives at home with his parents Andy, 55 and Jenny, 53 on their £1 million family estate, but he often joins his older brother Tom, 26 for nights out in London.

In spite of Will's fun attitude on social media, the reality of farm life is also tough. In 2021, the Young's estate was the victim of a horrific sheep mauling that left 25 lambs dead and another 20 injured, which traumatised the whole family.

Alongside the working farm, the family also run a luxurious AirBnB on site, and the two-bedroom cottage is available to rent for guests to enjoy the beautiful countryside.

Yet Will's rural background hasn't kept him away from brushes with celebrities, as he revealed that Claudia Winkleman came to his farm.

The Strictly Come Dancing host threw a bucket of water over Will for a video, after she had filmed an advert for Head and Shoulders.

Will shared the clip to his TikTok back in November, where the topless farmer is doused in water by The Traitors host. He recalled about the event: ""Claudia Winkleman came to my farm. She was lovely and got stuck in. She poured water over me.""

After it was announced on Monday that Will is joining the show, the farmer has also opened up about why he is still single.

""Honestly? Probably commitment issues. I self-sabotage myself sometimes when I've got a good thing going,"" he admitted.

""I do like my own space and my own time; I haven't got to stress about anything and just worry about myself.""

Thinking back on his dating life, Will added: ""I'm not a big dater but the dates I've been on have been super romantic.

""For the right girl I can be quite romantic. Once I took a girl on a date to the bottom of our farm where there's this really nice hill with amazing views surrounding it. I put fairy lights all up in the tree, I set up a picnic with wine and we watched the sunset.""

Love Island returns on Monday, January 16 on ITV2 and ITVX.

Our Yorkshire Farm star Amanda Owen recently bagged a brand-new show called Amanda Owen's Farming Lives on More4

Amanda Owen has secured a brand new TV show after her 'tough' split from her husband Clive Owen.

The shepherdess is best known for fronting Channel 5's Our Yorkshire Farm with her large family as she shows the realities of life on their Ravenseat Farm.

However, not only did the show get cancelled after four years on the air but she parted ways with Clive in June 2022, after 21 years.

After a few difficult changes in her life, Amanda recently landed her first solo series called Amanda Owen's Farming Lives.

The brand-new series is set to start this month and will be airing on More4.

Amanda, who shares nine children with Clive, will be visiting other working farms in the UK.

The star will be sharing what it's like to work on the farms and the struggles of the large industry.

Travelling through six different farms, viewers will get to see lands passed down through generations and totally new spaces.

Speaking about the new show, the 48-year-old said: ""If you're in farming and agriculture, it's very easy to feel like you're unsupported, even vilified, heartening to see how different people were making it work and how diverse modern farming is.""

Meanwhile, Amanda recently said single life has been 'tough' after splitting from Clive last summer.

The two have been married for almost 22 years so she has found navigating single life can be confusing and difficult.

However, despite keeping busy with other TV appearances, Amanda has said that she has found it ""tough"" since splitting from her husband but says they ""just have to get on with it"".

Speaking to the Radio Times Amanda said: ""Look, there are two simple facts: if he thought I was brilliant, and I thought he was brilliant, then we wouldn't have separated.

""It's a fact, isn't it? But, you know what, that's not unique, it's just how things are, pressures, all the rest of it. But we have nine kids, with associated friends, girlfriends, and we just have to get on with it.""

As the duo are now separated, she had to film her new documentary in small sections in order to plan around her children.

Amanda Owen's Farming Lives premiers on January 25th at 9pm on More4.

51,"One in five Brits willing to become more vegan - due to dairy cow farming practices","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/dairy-cow-farming-animals-vegan-30015352","One in five Brits willing to become more vegan - due to dairy cow farming practices

A fifth of dairy cows spend their entire lives in a shed, and never get to graze - but just three in ten Brits are aware of this, research finds

Millions of Brits wrongly believe that all cows live free range - when 20% actually spend their entire lives in sheds.

A poll of 2,000 adults found only three in ten are aware of the zero-grazing practice - where the dairy cow is never allowed to roam free, being kept in a shed for its entire life.

But campaigners claim this affects up to a fifth of UK dairy cows.

After being made aware of the farming technique, 69% of consumers opposed it on ethical grounds, and 49% said they would be unlikely to buy any dairy products that were a result of this indoor process.

Meanwhile, 56% went as far as to say it should be banned completely - as 87% believe cows deserve a nice life.

The research was commissioned by Viva!, whose spokesman said: ""Ignorance about the UK dairy industry is widespread and profound.

""It's not accidental that consumers are ignorant of zero-grazing and other cruelties in the dairy industry - it is purposely camouflaged by constant images of a non-existent rural idyll.

""Zero-grazing is sweeping across the world, and already one in five UK dairy cows are victims, despite overwhelming scientific and public opposition.""

The research also found just 41% of adults were aware cows have to be made pregnant and give birth to a calf before they can give milk.

And only 27% knew all calves are grabbed from their mothers at birth - and either killed, or locked away in isolation.

Once aware of the facts, almost a quarter (24%) claimed they were prepared to change their habits to become more vegan - with 25-34-year-olds most likely to do so (45%).

The thought of animals being poorly treated (58%), and the environmental impacts of the meat and dairy industry (56%), were the main drivers of this change.

Of those willing to change their habits, 53% would try plant milks instead of dairy milk, and 48% would attempt to reduce their consumption of cheese.

Although both of these top the list of things considered hardest to cut out of their diet - alongside chicken and butter, according to the research carried out via OnePoll.

In fact, almost one in ten (9%) consider themselves a ""flexidairian"" - a term coined by Viva! to describe someone that wants to cut out dairy, but finds it hard to do so.

The spokesman added: ""There is a clear lack of knowledge when it comes to how cows are treated, as it is often glossed over.

""But it's encouraging to see people are willing to change their diets and cut back on dairy foods as a result of the inhumane processes used in farming.""

Emma Ledbury has revealed her shock after discovering fans of Clarkson's Farm had raised £34,000 to help her farm which had been struck by TB wiping out her livestock

Clarkson's Farm star Emma Ledbury has said she was in ""total shock"" when fans of the show raised an eyewatering amount to help her TB-hit farm recover.

The dairy farmer appeared on the Prime Video series when she told Jeremy Clarkson that hold of her herd of 60 cows had been completely wiped out by the disease.

After the episode was released onto the streaming giant, fans rallied around to help Emma raise money to get herself back on track and ensure that she was able to relaunch her business.

During an appearance on Channel 4's Steph's Packed Lunch, Emma explained that fan Beccie Poole created a GoFundMe page for the farmer.

Emma said: ""It was a real shock, we found out this lovely lady called Beccie, that we'd never met before, a total stranger, had set up a GoFundMe page through seeing my story on Clarkson's Farm.

""It's really lovely, a total shock.

""I was literally on telly for 30 seconds, so never expected any sort of support in this way, it's just really lovely of everybody that's donated.""

The dairy farmer revealed that the majority of the £34,000 will be donated to the Royal Agriculture Benevolent Institution (RABI) - a charity organisation which is dedicated to supporting farming communities across both England and Wales.

She continued: ""It's become quite overwhelming the amount of support we've had from the general public and their donations.

""So it's really lovely that there's such a big pot there now that we can give some money to RABI to ensure that they can get some more help out to other farmers through counselling or TB advice.""

While Emma acknowledged that the money could have massively helped her, she insisted that it could also help more farmers across the two countries.

Reflecting on the devastating impact TB had on her 120-acre farm on the Oxfordshire and Warwickshire border, she told Steph McGovern: ""It's just devastating to lose your cows when you've spent so long, rearing them and getting them to be as healthy as possible, through no control of your own.""

Emma added that the effects were ""depressing"" as the farmer can never get over losing so many animals had lost their lives due to the disease.

The farmer went on to say that livestock owners across the entire nation are losing ""thousands of cows"" each year as TB continues to wipe out the animals.

53,"Extremely rare case of mad cow disease detected at slaughter house for beef","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/extremely-rare-case-mad-cow-30073354","Extremely rare case of mad cow disease detected at slaughter house for beef

The USDA has reported one isolated case of mad cow disease, or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), in a cow at beef slaughter plant located in South Carolina

An extremely rare case of mad cow disease has been detected at a slaughter plant.

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has reported a case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease, in a cow at a slaughter plant located in South Carolina, US.

The neurologic disease, which affects cattle, has caused quite a stir among authorities and the public alike.

However, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has assured citizens that there is no cause for alarm, as the infected animal never entered the food supply chain, posing no threat to human health in the United States.

This peculiar incident unfolded when the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL), under the APHIS, confirmed that the infected cow tested positive for atypical L-type BSE.

The routine surveillance conducted by APHIS on cattle deemed unsuitable for slaughter led to the identification of this case, the USDA explained in an announcement.

The cow was equipped with a radio frequency identification tag, which traced back to a herd in Tennessee.

As investigations continue, APHIS and veterinary officials from South Carolina and Tennessee are collaborating to gather more information regarding this case.

Atypical BSE, which generally affects older cattle and arises sporadically, has been detected on seven occasions in the United States.

Of these cases, the initial instance in 2003 involved classical BSE in a cow imported from Canada, while the subsequent occurrences have been classified as atypical (H- or L-type) BSE.

The World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) recognizes the United States as having negligible risk for BSE.

In accordance with WOAH guidelines, atypical BSE cases have no bearing on the official BSE risk status recognition, as this form of the disease is believed to arise spontaneously and rarely in all cattle populations.

Thus, this recent finding of an atypical case will not impact the US' negligible risk status, and trade issues are not anticipated as a consequence.

The United States boasts a robust system of intertwined safeguards against BSE, safeguarding both public and animal health.

The foremost protection is the removal of specified risk materials, which are parts of an animal that may contain BSE, from all animals presented for slaughter.

Furthermore, a stringent feed ban is in place to shield cattle from the disease.

The ongoing BSE surveillance program implemented by the USDA is another vital component of this comprehensive system, facilitating the detection of the disease at extremely low levels within the US cattle population.

Millions of chickens in Iowa and Ohio, two of the largest egg-producing states in the US, have been culled as a result of the latest outbreak of bird flu that began in 2022

More than 1.3 million chickens are set to be slaughtered on an egg farm as the US continues to battle a bird flu outbreak.

According to the US Department of Agriculture, all 1.35 million chickens at an egg farm in Ohio's Union County are set to be slaughtered to help limit the spread of the highly contagious virus. It comes after a case was confirmed in the flock this week.

The outbreak that began in early 2022 has been far less severe this year with fewer cases of the virus being found among the wild birds that spread it. But there have still been 8.1 million birds killed this year to help control the spread of the disease.

5.8 million of those have come just this month as several large egg farms have been struck down with the virus. That includes 1.2 million birds at an Iowa egg farm and another 940,000 chickens at one Minnesota egg farm that had to be killed.

Egg farms tend to be far bigger than turkey or chicken farms, sometimes home to millions of birds. It's one of the reasons Iowa, the US's largest egg-producing state, has been hit hardest in this latest outbreak with almost 17.3 million birds killed.

Ohio is another one of the top egg-producing states but has only seen 5.1 million birds killed due to bird flu. Sizeable bird flu outbreaks have also been confirmed on farms in Minnesota, Maryland, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Georgia, and California.

The biggest of those was in Maryland on a chicken farm where 198,200 birds were killed. In 2022 almost 58 million birds were slaughtered as part of the outbreak.

The highly contagious virus is spread easily by wild birds through droppings and nasal discharges. Farmers are working hard to keep the virus from infecting their flocks by taking steps like requiring workers to shower and change clothes before entering barns, sanitising trucks that enter a farm and investing in separate sets of tools for every barn.

But the virus is difficult to keep out, especially along the main pathways for migrating birds who are heading south for the winter. Officials have advised bird flu doesn't represent a significant health threat.

Human cases are extremely rare and none of the infected birds are allowed into the nation's food supply. Properly cooking poultry and eggs to 73.89C will also kill any viruses.

Wildlife officials have previously warned anglers who catch a northern snakehead to 'kill it immediately.' A slightly less alarming memo called on anyone who sees them to 'kill the fish by freezing it or putting it on ice for an extended length of time'

An invasive predator ""Frankenfish"" that can survive for days out of water has been found in a drainage pool sparking fears of the creature's uncontrollable spread.

A northern snakehead, indigenous to east Asia, was found in a drainage pool at Duck Creek Conservation Area, Missouri.

It's been four years since the species last was seen there.

The alarm has been sounded and officials are calling on anyone who catches a specimen should photograph it and ""kill the fish by freezing it or putting it on ice for an extended length of time.""

On May 19, state workers used a net to pull out a 13-inch northern snakehead.

The fish was found in the same water basin as the first one caught in 2019.

Many anglers don't know what an impact an uncontrolled population would have on the environment.

In their native east Asia, the snakeheads are considered a delicacy thought to have healing powers.

In 2002 the US government banned the import and transport of live northern snakeheads. Despite this they are still flourishing in parts of the US.

Dave Knuth, a Missouri fisheries management biologist based in Cape Girardeau said: ""They are knocking on the door in Arkansas. They are a beast.""

The fish reproduce quickly and can wiggle across muddy land. They grow up to three feet long.

Mr Knuth added that a find early in the year is worrying, saying: ""I didn't expect them to be this far up the state already.""

The first of its species found in Missouri was in 2019 in a ditch nearby this new find.

Officials spent days searching for additional northern snakeheads but no others were found.

Larry Underwood, 73, who lives near the conservation area, wished the state well but noted that the state also tries and fails to control feral hogs.

""It's kind of like the hogs,"" he said. ""You are going to eliminate that? Yeah, good luck.""

The fish have been spotted in Pennsylvania and in Georgia before.

After one fisherman reported catching one in Georgia, an official advised him to: ""Kill it immediately.""

In 2015, a team of U.S. Geological Survey scientists found a group of the fish riddled with bacteria that is known to cause chronic disease among a wide range of animals.

Diddly Squat Farm owner Jeremy Clarkson has made a savage remark over worker Kaleb Cooper's throwback pic as he shared a snap of what he looked like when he was younger

Jeremy Clarkson didn't hold back his opinion as he made a savage comment on Kaleb Cooper's throwback snap.

The Clarkson's Farm owner, 63, has a strong reputation for his brutal remarks and co-star Kaleb didn't get out unscathed.

Kaleb, 24, quickly became a hit with viewers on the Amazon show as he helped out the former Top Gear host on his 1,000 acre Cotswolds farm.

He used his prior knowledge of farm live to help with numerous tasks as well as building a humorous relationship with Jeremy.

The young farmer took to his own social media account to share a snap of himself as a teenager at a farm.

He captioned the post: ""This is a throw back 14 years old working on a dairy farm. Dreams don't work unless you do!""

Just like their cheeky banter on the show, Jeremy commented: ""Bit pudgy"".

Kaleb recently rocked up at Downing Street for the Government's Farm to Fork summit in the hopes to secure the UK's supermarket supply chains.

The summit follows an announcement that farmers are to be given greater protection in future trade deals as part of a new package of measures unveiled recently.

Jeremy has revealed he is facing financial worries on Diddly Squat Farm after ""selling food at a loss"".

Claiming it was 'the last roll of the dice', he said: ""On top of the physical issues, which will only get worse, there are financial problems too. And they're going to get worse as well.

'Because the grants and subsidies that I used to get from the EU, to recompense me for selling food at a loss, are dwindling until, in three years' time, they will dry up completely. These, then, are troubling times, because what am I to do?

""Farming hurts my back and my knees, and if I attempt to use my land to grow food, I'll lose money. It has been causing me some sleepless nights, that's for sure,"" reports The Sunday Times.

Self-made agricultural entrepreneur Kaleb has been working in and around farms since he was at school and wants to help those who share his passion.

He has joined forces with the Royal Agricultural University (RAU) to launch a new bursary for those looking to follow in his footsteps and launch a career in agriculture.

Kaleb said: ""Farming is who I am. Encouraging the younger generation into agriculture has always been so important to me.

""I feel lucky that I knew my path from such an early age and want to help spread that passion and drive. Launching this bursary means so much, as it can support students who want to pursue an agricultural career or who might be struggling to get into farming.""

Father of one Kaleb is also set to become a dad again after he revealed in January he and his fiancÃ©e Taya are expecting a girl.

Jeremy Clarkson's Diddly Squat farm, which fans can see on his top rated Amazon show, has received more than £250,000 in government and EU subsidies in under three years

Multi-millionaire Jeremy Clarkson's farm raked in government and EU subsidies topping £250,000 in under three years.

Diddly Squat Farm, which features in the hit Amazon Prime show Clarkson's Farm, benefitted from two payments from The Rural Payments Agency.

Figures obtained using Environmental Information regulations reveal that the agency, part of DEFRA, awarded the business £133,733.01 under the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS), split across two payments in December 2021 and 2022.

In addition, the Cotswolds farm received £116,352 in four payments from May 2020 to December 2022 under the Environmental Stewardship (ES) scheme.

Last year, Clarkson - estimated to have a personal fortune of £50 million - claimed people ""don't pay enough for their food"".

Speaking during an interview with the News Agents podcast in November, Clarkson told the presenters Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel about economic problems faced by farmers and was asked if food prices should go up.

He replied ""Yeah, they should. They should be double what they are.""

Clarkson, 63, who presents The Grand Tour on Amazon as well as Who Wants To Be A Millionaire on ITV, bought his Oxfordshire farm in 2008.

The Amazon Prime show regularly shows the farm's staff telling Clarkson he is being useless.

Its popularity attracts thousands of visitors to the Diddly Squat farm shop to buy products such as ""Cow Juice"", rapeseed oil, chutneys and jams.

The RPA commented: ""The Basic Payments Scheme (BPS) makes income support payments to farmers carrying out qualifying agricultural activities on eligible agricultural land that they own or hold as tenants.

""Now that we have left the EU, BPS is being phased out in favour of alternative schemes that will reward farmers directly for the public benefits that they provide.

""Agri-environmental schemes reward farmers and land managers for looking after and improving the environment - conserving and restoring wildlife habitats; maintaining good air and water quality; managing flood risk; creating and managing woodland and preserving historical features in the landscape.""

According to Defra, BPS payments have been fully funded by the UK government since 2021 and ES payments were fully funded by the EU from 2020-22.

In the finale of the first series of Clarkson's Farm, the TV star pointed out - in reference to the farm's finances - he had ""worked bloody hard all year and my reward was £144"".

The former Top Gear presenter has won praise for showcasing British farming - he was named NFU's 2021 ""Farming Champion of the Year"" at the Farmers Weekly Awards.

Clarkson's assistant was contacted for comment.

The Welsh Government in the Senedd is expected to back plans to outlaw the devices on Tuesday - triggering fresh calls for other British governments to follow suit

""Barbaric"" snares which trap wild animals will be banned in Wales - piling pressure on the rest of Britain to outlaw the devices.

Calls are growing for a UK-wide block on the cruel traps as the Wales Agriculture Bill moves to its final stage of Senedd scrutiny on Tuesday.

It means Cardiff Bay will become the first part of the UK to scrap the devices designed to catch foxes and other predators but which also harm badgers, rabbits, lambs and even cats and dogs which stray into the countryside.

Animal Aid director Iain Green said: ""To the majority of people who love and cherish our wildlife, the use of these archaic, barbaric implements to trap and kill animals is appallingly cruel and needs to end - and we are delighted the Welsh Government has listened to the people and taken decisive action to protect our wildlife.

""Snares, which are essentially a loop made of wire, are used by gamekeepers to trap animals by the neck, before killing them in order to ""˜protect' pheasants and partridges - that is, until the start of the shooting season when they too will be killed for ""˜sport'.""

He said animals caught in snares ""face hour upon hour of pain and panic, with a wire loop digging into their flesh as they struggle in vain to escape"".

Read More

He added: ""Snares are inhumane and inexcusable, and there should be no place for them in today's society.

""We hope that the Scottish Government and Westminster will follow the compassionate lead of the Welsh Government.""

Last year, MPs held a parliamentary debate on banning snares after an online petition was signed more than 100,000 times.

TV presenter and wildlife campaigner Chris Packham told the Mirror at the time: ""These Stone Age contraptions really have no place in today's Britain.

""They are cruel and barbaric, trapping something like 1.7 million animals every year and, in the process, causing horrendous suffering to wildlife and domestic animals too.""

The first-ever ""made-in-Wales"" Agriculture Bill has its ""stage four"" Senedd scrutiny next week.

Members are expected to back the legislation before it receives Royal Assent from the King - becoming law in Wales.

Rural Affairs Minister Lesley Griffiths told the Mirror snares ""are inherently indiscriminate"".

""Our programme for government includes a commitment to ban the use of snares as a means of trapping and capturing wild animals,"" she said.

""They are not compatible with the high animal welfare standards we strive for here in Wales and can cause a great deal of suffering, severe injury and even kill.

""Should the Bill be passed and receive Royal Assent, the use of snares in Wales would be completely banned.""

Hailing a ""fantastic move"", League Against Cruel Sports public affairs chief Will Morton said: ""The ban now sets the bar for the rest of the UK to meet, and we look forward to the UK and Scottish governments taking steps to ban these brutal devices which cause so much suffering.

""Our polling shows that a ban on snares in the UK will have the support of nearly three quarters of the public.""

Mountain vineyards - where the popular tipple is produced - are most at risk from soil degradation and drought, say scientists in the latest devastating news about climate change

Prosecco could soon be wiped out by climate change, according to new research.

Mountainside vineyards - where the popular tipple is produced - are most at risk from soil degradation and drought, scientists say. The concern also applies to other famous vintages including Burgundy, Grand Cru and Cabernet Sauvignon, the world's most popular red. Study lead author Dr Paolo Tarolli, of the University of Padova in Italy, said: ""The risk is not only losing an agricultural product or seeing a landscape change, negatively impacting the local economy. The risk is losing entire communities' history and their cultural roots.""

The soils on mountain vineyards are usually thin and eroded and the struggle is massive for grapes which send their roots deep in search of water. Mountain soils also lead to grapes that are small, about the size of a typical blueberry. Small grapes have a higher ratio of skin to juice. Because so much aroma, flavour, and tannin are lodged in the skins, mountain wines often have intense flavours and, for red wines, copious tannin and therefore considerable structure.

Tucked into the hillsides of Italy, Portugal, and Spain, they are also the most difficult to maintain - coining the expression 'heroic viticulture.' Extreme weather and changing socioeconomic conditions are making them even more challenging. They are the most vulnerable to global warming.

Farmers and scientists must work together to save some of the world's most celebrated wines, say the Italian team. Dr Tarolli said: ""The great effort required to manage these areas reinforces the specific human-environment connection. This is why they are recognised as cultural uniquenesses of primary historical and social importance, where traditional knowledge is still the determining element.""

The study lists poor soil and less rain as the biggest threat to the industry. It also cites several significant socioeconomic barriers. Dr Tarolli said: ""The last half past century has been characterised by rural exodus and a gradual abandonment of mountain landscapes. The new generation is unwilling to continue working under extreme conditions if economic benefits are insignificant.""

Mountain vineyards are expensive to farm. Every bit of the work - from planting a vine to harvesting the grapes - is slow and painstaking. And it usually has to be done by hard, because most tractors and mechanical harvesters can't negotiate steep inclines. They are also part of a larger 'polyculture', often ringed by forests and other types of vegetation as well as wildlife. Heroic viticulture sites either have a slope steeper than 30 percent, are located on small islands, higher than 500 metres above sea level or incorporate vines grown on terraces. The name originated from the inherent difficulty of cultivating and harvesting crops in these landscapes.

Centuries-old examples include the Prosecco Hills of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene, Treviso, and the traditional vineyards of Pantelleria Island in the Strait of Sicily, both of which are protected by UNESCO. The growing popularity of Prosecco has seen demand soar by more than a third in five years, the fastest of any sparkling wine with champagne showing only around one percent growth over the same time period.

The researchers suggest strategic communications designed to unite scientists, farmers and consumers to onsite solutions like integrated small water storage systems to prevent runoff. They also underline the importance of educating young people about the benefits of rural communities, preserving cultural heritage, living in equilibrium with the environment and sustainable agriculture.

Dr Tarolli added: ""The key to success lies in combining the traditional knowledge of winemakers with innovation and scientific rigor. In this way, farms can work closely with scientists to optimise investments for a more functional, sustainable, and safe agricultural landscape - a winning alliance to face these diverse natural and anthropogenic challenges.""

The Georgia Department of Agriculture (GDA) announced it had detected the invasive killer species after a beekeeper in Savannah made the discovery earlier this month

The dangerous bee-eating Asian hornet has been spotted in the US for the first time as officials issue a warning over the invasive pest.

The Georgia Department of Agriculture says a beekeeper in Savannah discovered the yellow-legged hornet earlier this month. There are now growing fears the hornet could threaten bee hives and honey production.

If the hornet establishes itself in Georgia, agriculture and US native pollinators could be under threat., experts warn. The GDA say a team of professionals is now working on tracking the yellow-legged hornet while asking for the public to help spot these hornets.

Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper said: ""Georgians play an important role helping GDA identify unwanted, non-native pests, and I want to thank the beekeeper who reported his sighting to us, as well as our partners at the University of Georgia and USDA's Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service for working swiftly to confirm its identity.

""Our experienced team of professionals will continue to assess the situation and are working directly with USDA APHIS and UGA to trap, track, and eradicate the yellow-legged hornet in Georgia. ""

The yellow-legged hornet is a social wasp species that builds egg-shaped paper nests which can become huge, with an average of 6,000 workers. Native to tropical and subtropical areas of Southeast Asia, the species can be fatal to other insects, reports WSB-TV.

While the GDA is asking for reports from the public if spotted, they also advise caution in the event of a sighting. The GDA said its team of Pest Program scientists, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and academic experts are developing an ""˜operational plan to trap, track, and eradicate the yellow-legged hornet in Georgia.'

Dr. Mark Davidson, Deputy Administrator of APHIS' Plant Protection and Quarantine Program said: ""The foundation of this response is the strong relationship USDA has developed with the Georgia Department of Agriculture and the University of Georgia over many years. Our partnership is already paying off as our teams come together to apply the science and technology in our response planning. The public can also play a critical role by reporting potential sightings of the hornet to help eradicate this pest.""

GDA's website has been updated with additional information regarding the yellow-legged hornet and an easily accessible form to report potential sightings. This information is prominently displayed on the homepage of the website. Georgians with additional questions or concerns are encouraged to email us at yellow.legged.hornet@agr.georgia.gov.

Cruel 'puppy butchers' are charging dog owners as much as £1,000 to mutilate their pet's ears without proper anaesthetic during illegal DIY procedures at backstreet 'clinics', a charity has said

DIY 'vets' are charging as much as £1,000 to mutilate the ears of small dogs as part of a cruel and illegal trend, it has been revealed.

Animal cruelty investigators have reported a huge rise in ear cropping, with the Scottish SPCA seeing an increase of more than 600% in calls relating to the practice in only six years.

The organisation said it is now receiving more and more reports about the work 'puppy butchers', who wield scissors, kitchen knives and scalpels on unwitting pets, reports the Daily Record.

Ear cropping - the popularity of which has partly been blamed on celebrities who post photos of their pets on social media - can cost owners up to a grand, and is often carried out without adequate anaesthetic at backstreet clinics.

It provides no benefits for the dog and can inflict permanent damage, including an inability of their ears to stand properly and possible infection.

The practice is classed as animal cruelty in the UK, and a number of people have been prosecuted for carrying it out in recent years following tip-offs by members of the public.

In January this year a dog owner pled guilty at Glasgow Sheriff Court to causing unnecessary suffering through failing to provide veterinary treatment for injuries caused by a prohibited procedure.

His tiny dogs were seized, and he was slapped with a two-year ban on keeping animals.

He also received a 40-day restriction of liberty order.

A Scottish SPCA SIU inspector involved in the case said they were alerted by a member of the public.

He said: ""Both dogs had injuries to their ears. The wounds were red, crusted and looked recent.

""We immediately removed the dogs due to concerns for their welfare and took them to one of our centres to be examined by a vet. The vet examined their wounds and found they were still in a stage of healing and appeared to cause some discomfort when touched.

""This illegal procedure would have caused these puppies considerable pain and discomfort, for purely cosmetic reasons

The inspector said Chrystal had claimed he had owned the puppies for two weeks and that their ears were already cropped when he received them.

He also shared that they were given to him ""˜on breeder's terms', meaning he would keep them as a pet until the breeder required them back for breeding.

Both pups have been since been rehomed.

Another similar case saw a man given a 12-month ban on owning, keeping or working with animals after he admitted allowing the dog's ears to be cropped. He claimed he believed such a procedure would make the pet less aggressive.

Scottish SPCA chief superintendent Mike Flynn said: ""It's incredibly worrying to see the increase in ear cropping over the past three years. We want to be clear on this: ear cropping is a needless cosmetic procedure that inflicts horrendous suffering on dogs. It serves no purpose other than to make the animal look a certain way.

""In order to avoid detection, this procedure is often carried out on young puppies without sedation, pain relief or proper veterinary care. Due to this, when we are alerted to these types of incidents, the wounds are usually horribly infected and the puppy is in a tremendous amount of pain.

""We would urge the public not to purchase animals with cropped ears. Even if you are told the dog has been imported from another country where this procedure is legal, often this is not the case and the ear cropping has simply been carried out illegally.

""Regardless of where the procedure is carried out, by purchasing that dog you are contributing to their suffering and the suffering of other dogs like them.

He urged anyone in Scotland with information on those carrying out ear cropping procedures to call their confidential animal helpline on 03000 999 999.

The RSPCA also operate a confidential helpline in England and Wales, which can be reached by dialling 0300 1234 999.

For days shoppers have been photographing gaps on the shelves where fruit and veg should be, as some supermarkets resort to rationing peppers, tomatoes and cucumbers

At the end of the usually ­bustling fruit and veg aisle, an elderly man is eyeing up a ­sad-looking, solitary cucumber.

""Is this it?"" he says, putting it in his supermarket basket and looking puzzled. ""Where's the rest?""

It is a good question, and one we have all been asking.

For days shoppers have been photographing gaps on the shelves where fruit and veg should be and a YouGov poll reveals 61% of us have noticed sudden shortages.

With stocks running low, Lidl, Aldi, Tesco, Morrisons and Asda have resorted to rationing peppers, tomatoes and cucumbers.

Environment Secretary Therese Coffey has warned the disruption could carry on for weeks.

So what is causing the shortages while European shelves are well-stocked? And how are shoppers, retailers and prices being affected?

Superstores blame cold weather for reducing outdoor harvests from usually hot countries (we import 20% of our tomatoes from Spain and 25% from Morocco) and soaring energy bills, disrupting imports from glasshouse producers in places such as the Netherlands.

British-grown crops are down, too. The National Farmers Union points to a 79% rise in fuel bills and 179% hike in fertiliser costs since 2019, on top of the cold winter.

It has hit crops such as carrots and ­cauliflowers and delayed new planting. The NFU is predicting record low yields for UK energy-intensive foods.

Brexit has increased labour costs and industry commentator Chris White, of FruitNet, says leaving the EU has affected the UK's place in the global supply chain.

He adds: ""It is less costly for a supplier to supply to the ­Netherlands and other countries, because they don't have these 25 miles of the Channel to negotiate.""

But there are reports of smaller British shops faring better.

So how difficult is it to fill your basket this week? In Burnley, Lancs, it is not hard to spot gaps on the shelves.

There is a wide variety of shops here.

But at the first place we visit, an Asda, the shelves are empty, with signs ­apologising for missing items. There were no cucumbers or tomatoes at all.

Its tomatoes come from Spain, with the cheapest at 85p a packet and the most luxurious, £2.10. A cucumber is listed as 75p. It's a good price - when they're in stock.

Asda says: ""Like other ­ supermarkets, we are experiencing sourcing challenges on some products grown in southern Spain and North Africa.

""We have introduced a ­temporary limit of three of each product on a very small number of fruit and vegetable lines."" A Tesco, on the edge of town, is just as bad.

There are no ­multipacks of peppers or tomatoes and only organic cucumbers at a pricey £1.20. A shop floor worker tells me that when stocks do come in, shoppers will be restricted to buying three or less. The firm declined to comment.

One of the town's two Aldi stores is faring better. They have a big range of tomatoes, Spanish peppers and Moroccan cucumbers.

At Polish supermarket, Food Plus, getting hold of produce has not been a problem. Salad and more exotic fruit and vegetables are piled high.

But providing customers with this level of choice comes at a price.

Manager Kamaran Karim, 37, shows a picture of his well-stocked supplier in Poland and says: ""We can get anything, that isn't an issue. But the prices are high and supermarkets don't want to pay. I've paid £6.29 per kilo for cucumbers I sell at £3.99.

""So I lose money on them but it's worth it to be reliable to our customers, they come for those and buy other things.""

At The Big Fruit Shop, produce is available, much of which is imported from Turkey. But not at the value prices of ­supermarkets. Plum tomatoes are two for £1 while peppers are £1.79 for a bag of three.

Manager Yaz Ashraf, 40, says: ""The prices are extortionate. The harvest and climate have helped push ­everything up. We will pay and we'll try and keep prices down but that's not always possible.

""For us, it's more important to have the things our customers want. I don't know what will happen in the future but for now that's just how it is.

""People aren't happy but they still have to eat.""

British Retail Consortium Director of Food and Sustainability Andrew Opie says ­independent shops can be more flexible on pricing.

But he adds: ­""Supermarkets are adept at managing supply chain issues and are working with farmers to ensure customers can access a wide range of produce.""

Worse to come as climate changes

Exclusive by Nada Farhoud, Environment Editor

Food shortages and price hikes will become the norm due to the climate crisis, an expert has warned.

More extreme floods, frosts, droughts and heatwaves will destroy crops and reduce yields - meaning more gaps on shelves, environmental scientist Angela Terry said.

This is already happening in other parts of the world, but the problem is going to get worse, she said.

She added: ""Traditional weather patterns around the world have been completely disrupted, most recently in Spain and northern Africa.

""But this is not the first time extreme weather has impacted supplies. Last year Australia, one the world's biggest exporters of wheat, experienced droughts and floods leading to shortages. As the price of wheat goes up, it is possible to mix in other grains.

""But the difference this time is when you walk into a supermarket the fresh items are in front of you so you can't escape the empty aisles as there are no other alternatives.""

Calling for long-term action to secure supplies, she added: ""We're going to have to get used to price hikes and food shortages of certain products, depending on where extreme weather hits, and it is impossible to predict long term what that will be.

""Eating fruit and vegetables in season will help but we must be looking at more renewable sources of energy.

""Greenhouses rely on cheap energy we just don't have any more. The issue is only going to get worse so it is vital we introduce a food security strategy.""

Broccoli and cauliflower have been badly affected, experts say, but Christmas supplies of sprouts and parsnips are expected to recover enough by December 25

Shoppers have been warned to expect empty shelves in the supermarkets this Christmas as farmers battle with one of the toughest harvests on record.

Broccoli and cauliflower have been badly affected by heavy rainfall and supply issues, experts say, but sprouts and parsnips are expected to recover by December 25. Potato crops are on track to hit a record low of 4.1million tonnes, with retailers forced to supplement supplies from cold storage.

It follows unprecedented levels of rain after Storms Agnes, Babet and CiarÃ¡n battered Britain in recent weeks. The heavy rainfall has affected annual harvests, sparking fears for Christmas dinners.

Fred Searle, editor of Fresh Produce Journal, said: ""We're set for the lowest potato crop recorded in recent times at just 4.1 million tonnes. The British potato harvest has been hit hard by heavy rain and flooding in recent weeks, causing delayed lifting and large crop losses.

""This was preceded by a cold, wet spring and a cool summer with low light levels. With the potatoes that are in store there's likely to be enough supply to meet demand for the time being, but that might not be the case in the months ahead.""

Lincolnshire grower, Martin Tate, who manages 18,000 acres in the county, said: ""There won't be enough broccoli to supply the Christmas dinner demand. There is a nationwide shortage of broccoli, in fact, there's a European wide shortage.

""The whole of northern Europe, including Germany, has been experiencing the same wet conditions as us, as have Poland and Holland. Imports from Spain have been hit by an exceptionally dry summer/ Cauliflower is still a problem, and you can expect to see empty trays over the next few weeks but may return to normal before Christmas. After some initial issues brussels sprouts supplies look like they will be okay.""

Earlier this month, T.H. Clements, one of the country's largest suppliers of brussels sprouts with 11,000 acres in Lincolnshire and 1,000 in Cornwall, warned that sprouts would be smaller this year than average. CEO Chris Gedney told BBC 's Farming Today: ""Brussels sprouts are likely to be smaller this year as the larger ones tend to fall in the water and rot.""

However, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has said retailers will have enough supplies for families this Christmas. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC, said: ""High rainfall has created challenging conditions for farmers in the UK, however, food retailers are adept at managing disruption and have all the vegetables, potatoes and other festive foods households need for a great Christmas.""

One visitor to Jeremy Clarkson's Oxfordshire Diddly Squat Farm discovered there are a few things that are not seen on Clarkson's Farm

Since Jeremy Clarkson opened up Diddly Squat Farm to the public, it has attracted thousands of visitors from all over the country, but somethings are very different to what fans see on TV.

Dealing with the worst farming weather in decades, animals with a mind of their own and unresponsive crops - the nation watched on as the former Top Gear host attempted to run his 1,000 acre farm.

Diddly Squat Farm, in the heart of the Cotswolds, quickly became a much-loved destination with visitors from all over the country when The Grand Tour star decided to open his very open farm shop.

Featured in both series of Clarkson's Farm, fans of the show have flocked to the site to see if it really is like on the TV.

On the visit, as reported by Yorkshire Live, there were several staff members that were present in the shop but have yet to appear on the TV show while Jeremy Clarkson's girlfriend Lisa Hogan was missing from the shop.

Fans of the Amazon Prime Video series will know the Diddly Squat Farm Shop is Lisa's domain while her partner takes care of the farm itself.

It appeared several staff members had been hired to staff the shop during the time between filming seasons.

The infamous Diddly Squat Farm Shop sign is perhaps surprisingly made with cardboard lettering.

The former Top Gear presenter has used corrugated grey cardboard lettering nailed to the wood to sign post his shop.

It's clear from Clarkson's Farm that the shop where Jeremy sells his produce isn't particularly big.

But, on closer inspection the shop is much smaller than it seems which is one of the reasons for the huge queues fans must wait in before they get a chance to look inside.

People have to queue for hours just to get the chance to walk through it for a few minutes and the usable floor space, is probably ""no more than about 10ft by 8ft"".

On the Prime Video show, the farm shop and surrounding area look reportedly very different in real life.

On Clarkson's Farm, there are tidy rows of stock shown in the shop but in reality it's absolutely overflowing with souvenirs.

Piles of posters and postcards and even knitted dolls of Jeremy and Kaleb sat behind the till as well as Diddly Squat Gin and a freezer full of ice cream to cater for the tourists.

Outside, there are portaloos and several overflow emergency car parks are open and allowing cars in.

In very busy periods like half terms, there's a 'pop up shop' set up behind the farm shop building to serve more customers.

There is also a burger van and a bar serving alcoholic beverages including beer and cider for visitors while there's a local lavender flower seller all set up on the tables in the lambing shed.

Take a pen

Another thing that isn't shown in the Prime Video programme is the signs outside the lambing shed, which have been doodled on.

There are thousands of messages scrawled on the planks of wood from farm visitors, with cheeky messages such as 'James May is a d***o"" to ""We love Pepper"" (the cow Jeremy decided to keep as a pet).

Visitors to Diddly Squat Farm are encouraged to write their own lasting message on the signs.

There's a campsite next door

There is a surprisingly close campsite situated next door to the farm shop.

In season one, Jeremy references the campsite to farm management advisor Charlie Ireland as he joked he could make a ""killing selling farm produce to campers"" next door.

Although the above sign has not been shown on TV it's a stone's throw away from the shop.

This zesty trick might leave your plants looking worse for wear, with yellow scorched leaves. Luckily there is an easy solution to make sure your plants are healthy

Whether you're green-thumbed or a gardening novice, even the most low-maintenance plants can be tricky to take care of. There are a range of variables which might contribute to why your plants are struggling: you could be under or over-watering them, giving them too much or too little sun or it could just be a bad range of crops. It's understandable if you want to take on any advice which might make gardening easier.

There are plenty of unusual tips: using coffee grounds to fertilise your plants, cayenne pepper to ward off pests - and even strengthening seedlings with camomile tea. One tip gardeners will tell you to steer clear of, however, is the lemon water hack currently going viral online.

If you've not heard of the lemon water hack before, it's when you dilute some lemon juice in water and use it to water your garden or prized flowers. Sadly, according to HuffPost, if your soil is too alkaline, it can under-develop your plants. The theory behind this viral 'hack' is the acidity of lemon water can rebalance the pH of overly alkaline soil. While it makes sense in theory to lower the pH of your soil using diluted lemon juice, the reality is it could damage your plants.

You probably don't know exactly how alkaline your soil is, or how acidic any given lemon is, so you're unlikely to balance the pH exactly with these imprecise ingredients. In fact, you could very easily add too much acid to your soil, creating a completely different issue: overly acidic soil.

This can 'burn' the plants and create further nutrient deficiencies in the soil. Your plants may start to look yellow or 'splotchy', with cupped leaves. They might even appear scorched. They might not be able to absorb all-important nutrients, which can stunt their growth, and they may even die.

Before attempting to neutralise your soil, the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) warns that ""before adding any acidifying materials you need to check your soil pH to see how much (if any) you need to add."" Once you've measured the pH of your soil, the RHS recommends sprinkling a calculated amount of sulphur on your soil, personalised to your specific garden. The earlier you place it in the soil before planting, the better, so avoid adding soil additions close to winter. Summer and spring are the perfect seasons to rebalance your soil.

A brief statement from the retailer revealed the major change to the rationing scheme after it was brought in two weeks ago at several major supermarket chains

Supermarket chain Aldi has announced that it plans to lift limits on the numbers of vegetables customers can purchase, starting on Monday.

A brief statement from the retailer today (Saturday) said: ""From Monday (13th March), Aldi will remove all purchasing restrictions on fresh produce - including limits on tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers.""

Aldi imposed customer purchase limits on certain salad vegetables over two weeks ago, February 22 alongside several other major supermarket chains.

Aldi, Tesco, ASDA and Morrisons were among the supermarkets to impose the limits, blaming bad weather abroad for the low supplies of certain fresh veg.

On February 22 an Aldi spokesperson said: ""We are limiting purchases of peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes to three units per person to ensure that as many customers as possible can buy what they need.""

Clive Black, a top analyst at broker Shore Capital, said bad weather in Spain, where a lot of our produce comes from at this time of year, had come at a low point in the UK's growing season.

It has resulted in a ""perfect storm leading to sky-high prices for tomatoes and cucumbers,"" said Mr Black.

He echoed warnings that restrictions to supplies could drag on for ""weeks.""

Industry experts previously warned the crisis could last until as late as April, with Andrew Opie, Director of Food & Sustainability at the British Retail Consortium trade body, saying the issues were likely to last a ""few weeks"".

Suppliers in Morocco and Spain, which are two of the UK's biggest suppliers over the winter months, have experienced cold temperatures, heavy rain, and flooding over the past three to four weeks.

This has affected the crops and on top of this, the bad weather has caused several ferries which transport the vegetables to the UK to be halted.

The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said Britain typically imports 95% of its tomatoes and 90% of lettuces from December to March.

Another reason for the reduced supplies has also been down to rising energy costs for British growers.

British farmers are struggling to power their greenhouses which are used to grow specific crops during the colder months.

The British Retail Consortium said shortages were expected to last a few weeks until the UK growing season begins and retailers found alternative suppliers.

But the easing of restrictions at Aldi hopefully indicates that stocks are recovering, with a return to service as usual in supermarkets across Britain in the near future.

Leonardo DiCaprio didn't hesitate to squish a spotted lanternfly in New York. A bug expert spoke to The Mirror and shared whether or not the actor was helping the environment

Leonardo DiCaprio has made a name for himself as an environmentalist but a recent photo showing the actor stomping on spotted lantern flies might raise some eyebrows

The Titanic actor was seen out in Chelsea in New York City with his mum and her partner. The family outing turned violent when Leo squished some of the bugs with his feet and then continued on his day.

Spotted lantern flies are originally from Asia, and were first spotted in America in the state of Pennsylvania in 2014. Dr. Kacie Athey, a Specialty Crops Entomologist and Extension Specialist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, believes they got to the country by ""hitching a ride on something"" either trade-wise or just by a world traveler.

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.



But is Leonardo doing the right thing? Is the 90s heartthrob being a hypocrite when it comes to his environmentalist views as he stomps on the bugs the way he reportedly stomps on the hearts of anyone over 25? Dr. Athey shared her official recommendation on whether or not to kill the bugs.

""Squash it is what we're still telling people,"" She said, ""which is not something we normally say as a control strategy.""

Dr. Athey explained: ""It is a legit thing to do. it is kind of interesting. It is definitely, in the time that I've been doing entomology, the first time that a large campaign was just 'no seriously, squish that thing.'""

""They don't bite, they don't hurt you. we're not doing anything dangerous for the public,"" she added.

She calls the spotted lantern flies a ""nuisance pest."" They make plants ""sort of gross to be around"" and while it feeds on over 100 different plants, ""it doesn't do commercial damage to a lot of things like we thought it would,"" she said.

Though they've been here almost a decade, spotted lantern flies have made the news in recent months for various reasons, according to Dr. Athey, but the biggest is that they're appearing in more states across the country. The bugs are mostly found on the East Coast in states like Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland, and Delaware. But if you're in another state, while you should squish them, snap a quick picture before.

""What we would like is if someone would take a picture of it and kill it, unless you're in a place where they're already active,"" Dr. Athey said, You should send the picture to Cornell University, as they're leading the tracking research on the bugs. But if you're like Leonardo and in New York, ""feel free to squish as many as you want.""

King Charles III has put out a job advertisement for students to work at Sandringham over the summer and autumn months, with competitive pay and living accommodation part of the deal

King Charles III has offered a series of ""˜competitive' farming jobs to students over the summer and autumn months this year.

The monarch, 74, has created work placements for young people who want to learn more about organic farming.

The work will be carried out at Sandringham, and the roles include benefits such as ""highly competitive rates of pay and overtime"" and ""high-quality accommodation"".

The farming work will be in line with this year's harvest, with workers set to be employed from June to October this year.

A job advertised on the Royal Estate's website reads: ""Sandringham Farm is looking for harvest students to aid the farms team during harvest 2023.

""The role will involve using modern equipment in an interesting and unique environment.

""Candidates with a strong interest in organic farming or a willingness to learn new techniques would thrive in this role.""

The advertisement stated that the farm, situated near King's Lynn, stretches to 2,400ha and grows crops including wheat, barley, oats and beans.

Cattle and sheep are kept on the farm and are used within the rotation to cover crops and graze clover.

The work will include grain store maintenance and operation, some trailer work, occasional livestock work and estate maintenance, with the farm running a fleet of John Deere tractors.

While students are set to be welcomed onto the farm, it is thought that some of the monarch's other residences could also be opened up to the public, so that they can become more self-sufficient.

According to Forbes, Charles has a property portfolio worth some £20billion, including ten castles, 12 homes, 56 cottages and 14 ancient ruins.

Royal biographer Andrew Lownie said: ""We will see many more royal properties open to the public and hosting concerts such as Windsor, Sandringham and Balmoral.""

It comes after King Charles has given up his ""very special"" home in Wales, in a bid to scale back expenses associated with his multiple homes. Named Llwynywermod, the property is an old farmhouse which Charles and Camilla refurbished after buying it in 2007.

Following the Coronation, the King and his aides have shifted their attention towards the management of the various residences owned or used by the King, including Highgrove, Birkhall, Clarence House, Sandringham, and Balmoral, as well as official residences such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle.

One insider mentioned that this is an issue that requires attention, and discussions are underway regarding the possibility of increasing public access to some of the properties to help generate revenue.

The Hollywood star known for his stance on the environment so many were surprised to see his actions - but there is actually a wildlife-friendly reason for his move

Leonardo DiCaprio appeared to be going against his eco-friendly ethics when he was photographed stomping on some bugs.

The Hollywood star was seen putting his feet to work as he killed a batch of spotted lantern flies as he visited a New York City art gallery with his mum and her partner. Leo was in Chelsea NYC on Wednesday when he was faced with a swarm of the creepy crawlies.

The Wolf Of Wall Street star was then snapped vigorously stomping on the bugs as he hung out on the street. Leo is well known for his love of the environment and as an animal activist so the killing-spree seems a little against the grain for the Oscar winner.

However the move is actually a good thing, as it's what New Yorkers are being asked to do as part of a campaign to reduce the number of bugs in the city. While the creatures are harmless to humans, they damage trees and fruit crops which means their increasing number has confirmed wildlife experts.

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .

Meanwhile, Leo has found love again and has reportedly settled down with stunning Italian model Vittoria Ceretti. The Hollywood star has reportedly been dating Vittoria, 25, for at least two months and they were spotted kissing in a nightclub in Ibiza earlier this month. Leo, 48, is 23 years older than the leggy brunette with whom he appears to be smitten.

Leo has notoriously only dated women under the age of 25 and appears to break up with his significant other when they reach the milestone. But sources close to the Wolf Of Wall Street star now say that he has found true love. One insider claimed that he is ""besotted"" with Vittoria and that she is being called his ""girlfriend."" He has allegedly spent the summer jetting around the world with his new love.

One friend close to him told the Daily Mail : ""Vittoria is a beautiful girl, but Leonardo is of course surrounded by many beautiful girls most of the time. But he adores her and she him, they have been spending a lot of time together this summer, travelling around on romantic trips.

""It has obviously led to much chatter within his circle that Leo is ready to hang up his lothario ways. There have been many women pictured with him, partying with him, but what he has with Vittoria is much more serious.""

The daughter of designer Francesca Lazzari, Vittoria has modelled for big name labels including Versace and Alexander McQueen, as well as being a brand ambassador for Balenciaga. She has seemingly rubbed shoulders with many mutual acquaintances of Leonardo, including his alleged former flame Gigi Hadid.

Vittoria was previously married to Tales of Us DJ Matteo Milleri but the couple appear to have separated and she hasn't been seen with the 35-year-old New York-born Italian since December 29. She was however spotted in France with Leo in late May when his new film Killers of the Flower Moon was premiering at Cannes

West of England Metro Mayor Dan Norris, chairman of the League Against Cruel Sports' trustees, says bloodthirsty individuals who break the law by illegally hunting foxes, hares and deer need to be stopped

Today is the biggest date in the hunting calendar, with an estimated 200 Boxing Day meets expected across the UK.

Crowds will gather in town centres and on village greens to watch the horses, riders and hounds before they head out to the countryside. According to the League Against Cruel Sports there were hundreds of cases of suspected illegal hunting and hunt havoc around Christmas last year.

This includes the pursuit and killing of foxes, trespassing onto private land and disturbing livestock and pets. This illegal activity continues despite the fact that fox hunting has been banned in the UK for nearly 20 years.

Under the Hunting Act 2004, hounds are still allowed to follow an animal-based scent trail called trail hunting. As chair of the League, I am urging the next Government to ban trail hunting because evidence shows it has created a smokescreen for illegal activity.

And I am not alone in this view. Earlier this year the lead police officer in England and Wales responsible for hunting, Chief Superintendent Matt Longman, said that perpetrators avoid being caught by using trail hunting to carry on hunting foxes and other animals.

This isn't about destroying traditional ways of life. As a former MP and Rural Affairs Minister in the last Labour Government, I understand why people want to watch the spectacle of riders on horseback taking part in centuries' old Boxing Day parades through villages and towns.

Neither do I have any problem with people riding a predetermined route away from foxes, livestock, crops and private land following a non-animal scent without the pursuit or killing of wild animals. But those bloodthirsty individuals who break the law by illegally hunting foxes, hares and deer in the local countryside need to be stopped.

My greatest regret is that legislation I voted for back in 2004 has not ended this senseless cruelty. So this Boxing Day I am demanding that the loophole in the law be closed and hunting is consigned to the dustbin of history forever.

Do not be fooled into believing that this is a culture or a class war - people can wear what they want, blow horns and ride responsibly around the countryside. But killing animals for fun - no; that is not the mark of a modern day civilised society.

Tabled by former leader Tim Farron, the amendment seeks to ensure that live reindeer cannot be taken out of Britain for slaughter elsewhere

Reindeer would get special protection under the law under a move dubbed the ""Santa clause"" by MPs.

The Lib Dems tabled an amendment to the Animal Welfare Bill currently going through parliament, singling out the festive beasts. Tabled by former leader Tim Farron, the amendment seeks to ensure that live reindeer cannot be taken out of Britain for slaughter elsewhere.

It comes after the Mirror revealed a British company is advertising reindeer shooting holidays this Christmas. Hendry, Ramsay & Waters - run by businessman Vernon Waters - boasts that it ""is pleased to be able to offer Moose and trophy Reindeer hunting in the North Eastern part of Norway"". The ""exclusive"" trips would take place during three weeks in late summer.

Mr Farron said: ""Families this Christmas would be appalled to learn that reindeer don't have the protections they need under UK law. From British companies advertising reindeer shooting holidays to these animals facing being exported for slaughter, tragically too many reindeer are at risk of cruel treatment.""

If MPs vote for it on 15 January, the ""˜Santa clause' would add reindeer to the ""˜relevant livestock' listed in the Animal Welfare (Livestock exports) bill. The bill would ban the export of certain live animals for slaughter, after years of campaigning by activists including actress Dame Joanna Lumley.

The current list includes cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and horses. No live animals have been exported for slaughter since the Government announced plans to ban the practice in 2021.

But the new law will ensure this is put on a permanent basis. Last year, one batch of two live reindeer was exported from the UK, but it's thought this was for exhibition rather than slaughter.

Mr Farron added: ""This Christmas, I can't think of a better present than MPs backing our ""˜Santa Clause' amendment, to ensure reindeer get the protections they deserve.""

Mary Tangney, 74, was selflessly trying to rescue her sheep when she tragically drowned in a County Kerry river. Tributes have poured in for a ""beautiful"" and ""warm-hearted"" mother-of-five

Tributes are pouring in after a ""loving"" Irish mother-of-five tragically drowned in a horror accident as she bravely tried to rescue her livestock.

Mary Tangney, 74, was found in a County Kerry river shortly after 11am on Friday, December 1, near the Gap of Dunloe in Beaufort. Ms Tangney was pronounced dead after attempts were made to save her life at the scene.

It is believed that Ms Tangney, nÃ©e Dennehy, was attempting to rescue her sheep when the tragedy occurred - seemingly because they had found themselves stuck in the river. The Black Valley resident has been described as ""beautiful"" and ""warm-hearted"" as local councillors weighed in on her tragic passing.

Local councillor Patrick Connor-Scarteen, of the Fine Gael party, said it is ""shocking and very sad"" to hear of Ms Tangney's untimely death. ""This is a very close-knit community where everyone looks out for one another,"" he continued. ""Sheep farming would be one of the main occupations in this world-wide famous location. My sympathies are with this poor woman's family and also to her neighbours and friends right now.""

Another local councillor, Michael Cahill of Fianna FÃ¡il, described Ms Tangney as a ""very warm-hearted and loving"" person, the Irish Mirror reported. ""Mary was a beautiful woman who was well known, highly regarded and respected. My deepest sympathies are with her family, friends and neighbours.

""This tragedy has occurred so close to Christmas which only adds to the devastation her loved ones must be going through right now,"" Cahill added. Kerry IFA Chairman Kenneth Jones also offered his sympathy, saying he was ""very saddened to hear of Ms Tangney's tragic passing''.

The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) has confirmed that they are investigating the tragedy. Ms Tangney's death is the third farming tragedy in the past fortnight following the recent farming tragedies in Wexford and Carlow. Mary Tangney is survived by her husband Eugene (Genie) and children Karen, Patie, Niall, Eugene and Donnacha.

According to the Department of Agriculture over the past decade there are on average 19 workplace fatalities on Irish farms each year accounting for two in every five workplace fatalities. Almost one in five farm fatalities involved livestock.

The sheep were seen wandering across the flooded plains of Thessaly in Greece and came across a crop of medicinal cannabis that had been damaged by Storm Daniel

A herd of sheep were found acting in a strange way after they reportedly chewed through a large dose of mind-altering drugs.

The wandering animals were searching for food on the flooded plains of central Greece. But instead of finding any nourishing sustenance, they stumbled across 220lb worth of of cannabis. Ravenous, the sheep invaded a greenhouse producing medical cannabis near the Greek town of Almyros. It was not long before they made their way through the crop of already damaged plant matter.

Following their 'meal', the herd was then said to begin displaying unusual behaviour after they were spotted making their way across the plains of Thessaly. However, the exact nature of their actions was not fully explained.

The sheep finished off what remained of the crop that had been damaged by Storm Daniel and a recent heatwave, reports MailOnline. The owner of the crop told local media: ""I don't know if we should laugh or cry. We had the heatwave and we lost a lot of production. We had the floods, we lost almost everything. And now this. The herd entered the greenhouse and ate what was left. I don't know what to say, honestly.""

Storm Daniel ravaged the Mediterranean earlier this month, causing floods and loss of life in Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria. Officials also said that over 100,000 animals and livestock were killed in the three days that it battered Greece. While in the coastal city of Derna in Libya, thousands of people were feared dead following the devastating storm. Emergency teams worked to recover bodies from the city in the east of the country, which has a population of around 85,000, after large parts of it were destroyed.

Rescuers had said 10,000 people were reported still missing after floodwaters broke through two dams and smashed through the city, washing away entire neighbourhoods. Residents said they heard loud explosions and realised that dams outside the city had collapsed.

The search for a daring rodeo goat that disappeared over a week ago has united a small South Texas county, with locals using various means and even donating rewards to locate the wayward animal named ""Willy.""

The search for a daring rodeo goat that vanished over a week ago has brought together a small South Texas county.

Armed with horses, ATVs, and a strong dose of determination, the locals are now even mulling over the possibility of unleashing a helicopter to track down the wayward goat.

The goat escaped from its pen at the county's rodeo arena near Raymondville on July 15 and locals have scoured cotton and sugar cane fields tirelessly.

Local businesses have even stepped up to the plate, generously donating an impressive array of nearly 90 prizes and gifts totaling more than $5,000 to act as an incentive to track down the wayward goat. From mouth-watering brisket to chic salon services, the reward for the triumphant goat-finder is shaping up nicely.

Alison Savage, the indomitable president of the Willacy County Livestock Show and Fair said: ""We never imagined it would blow up like this. Our county is cozy, about 20,000 folks in total, and we're mostly a tight-knit community of farmers and ranchers. But it's heartening to witness everyone rallying together to locate our four-legged escape artist.""

Originally nameless, the runaway goat has now been dubbed ""Willy,"" an abbreviation of the beloved Willacy County, following a poll on the livestock show's Facebook page. As for Willy's gender, the authorities remain uncertain.

The livestock show has been diligently updating its Facebook page with regular progress reports on the ongoing search. Not only has this pursuit garnered unwavering support from the community, but it has also bolstered the livestock show's finances, with residents and businesses generously contributing funds for much-needed improvements to the nonprofit's arena and other facilities.

""He's a crafty one, that Willy! But we're closing in, mark my words. We're not giving up until we've got our beloved goat back,"" Alison added.

The organisers of the country show's Facebook page today confirmed (July 14) that Willy is ""willy"" hard to find, but nonetheless the search is still going strong.

The latest post added: ""What has become ""the great goat chase"" wasn't planned""¦ but if it had been, we couldn't have planned it better.

""At a time when the world is often scary, a little rodeo goat, now named Willy, has come along and united an entire community. It's taught us all that sometimes we need to focus on the good, and that even a nameless rodeo goat is important and worthy and plays a vital role in the world. In this case, the role is reminding us to be kind.

""To be good neighbors. To help each other out. To support one another. And that everyone is worthy of being saved, being found, and being loved.""

Every dog breed is different, coming with its own set of personality traits associated with them and lifestyle quirks. But one dog trainer has advice for which breeds to steer clear of

Dogs are all over the news at the moment, with a particular focus on XL Bullies, but they aren't the only controversial dog breed. The reality is that each pedigree dog comes with its own set of difficulties depending on the breed, whether that is due to their behaviour or their health. Just as all dog breeds come with their quirks, particularly popular ones like French bulldogs and pugs are hit with a number of health issues, meaning the vet bills rack up.

One dog trainer has gone viral on TikTok for sharing the three dog breeds that he would never own - one of which was particularly surprising. Garrett King, who runs TikTok channel American Standard K9, is best known to his audience of 3.2 million followers for his handy dog training tips. With his years of experience, he's developed strong opinions on what dogs he wouldn't own.

Garrett explained that the number one dog he would never own is the Central Asian Shepherd, also known as the Alabai. ""The males can get over 170 plus pounds and they are great livestock guardians. Problem is I don't have any livestock. Now if you have livestock at home then you might get this dog to help protect the flock,"" he explained.

The second dog he would never own was a bloodhound, because of their oily skin. ""That oily skin makes them stink like no other dog. I don't care how many baths you give them they just have a smell about them that's hard to get rid of"", Garrett revealed.

The third breed Garrett would never consider getting was the most surprising - the chihuahua. ""If I needed a 3lb demon from the underworld that served no other purpose than to sit on my lap and bite anything that comes within three feet range of me, then I'd get a chihuahua. But it'll be a hard pass for me on that one.""

Chihuahua fans were shocked by Garrett's character assassination of the tiny dog. One woman said ""Chihuahua are actually very smart, their aggressive behaviour actually comes from people treating them like a toy instead of a dog."" Meanwhile another chihuahua owner said ""my chihuahua is an angel. It's all about early training, don't be discouraged! Mine is super friendly towards strangers and all it wants is cuddles."" Another observed that ""chihuahuas are like cats, you either get a Satan or a Saint.""

Hopefield Animal Sanctuary in Brentwood, Essex, has slammed thoughtless revellers who set off the monster pyrotechnics, with the noises having already caused one of its horses to die

An animal shelter says two of its furry residents died after ""selfish"" neighbours let off fireworks causing terrified pets to suffer a heart attack and die.

Hopefield Animal Sanctuary in Brentwood, Essex, has slammed thoughtless revellers who set off the monster pyrotechnics, with the noises having already caused one of its horses to die. Bonfire Night saw Brits across the country launch fireworks as part of displays for the annual celebrations.

But the rescue centre shared a clip of one such display near to their base, reiterating a warning over the impact the noises can have. Posting on Facebook and TikTok, the shelter said those responsible were fully aware of the sanctuary nearby.

Horse Popkei died in 2019 as a result of the distress caused by the explosions, the sanctuary said. Popkei, who had reportedly been poorly for a while, ""basically died in the name of entertainment"", they said.

Posting footage of the loud bangs on Sunday, a spokesperson said: ""This is what we're having to deal with at the sanctuary tonight as we speak. Pure selfishness from our neighbours in Rushdene Road, who know full well they have an animal sanctuary located next door to them.

""Our poor animals are absolutely terrified, and tragically, two of our residents passed away suddenly and unexpectedly last night, from what we can only assume was a heart attack from being petrified of the constant explosions. We will need to contact their previous owners first before providing details.

""Our managers are on site trying to comfort our animals, but with over 600 it's not a small job and we're devastated that people are still ignoring the law on setting off fireworks near livestock."" While the government and animal welfare authorities strongly advise against launching fireworks near livestock, there is currently no legislation stopping people from doing so.

Many animal lovers have been campaigning in recent years for changes to the law surrounding fireworks over concerns for animal welfare as well as the many other safety issues surrounding them. Despite this, the government reiterated last week it had no plan to ban public sales but ""continued to monitor the situation"".

Sharing the sad news about Friesian horse Popkei's death, Hopefield said: ""We are urging people to reconsider setting fireworks off in their gardens, and to instead attend displays that comply with the laws and are less likely to be in close proximity to animals. Please do also choose a regulated display that puts animals first and foremost. It seems ludicrous to us that any local or national attraction that has animals on site, would also host a firework display.""

The 19-year-old lion, known as Loonkiito, was speared to death when he strayed too close to livestock in the Amboseli National Park and succumbed to his injuries

A lion long believed to be the oldest of its kind in the world at 19 has been killed by herders after straying too close to live stock.

The animal, known as Loonkiito, is said to have strayed too close to a pen in the Amboseli National Park on Wednesday when a group took action.

They used spears to push the ages predator away from the cows and he died owing to the wounds to his head.

Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) spokesman Paul Jinaro said: ""It was an old lion that had issues... getting prey on its own and livestock is easy prey.

""A normal lion would go for wildlife inside the park.""

A source told Gulf News: ""The animal entered the cowshed around 9pm and the owners attacked him with spears before he attacked the animals.

""It was weak due to old age and succumbed to the spear wounds in its head.""

Conservation group Lion Guardian hailed the majestic beast as a ""symbol of resilience and coexistence"" in an emotional Facebook post.

It read: ""It is with heavy hearts we share the news of the passing of Loonkiito (2004 - 2023), the oldest male lion in our ecosystem and possibly in Africa.

""He died yesterday, on the 10th of May 2023 at 19 years old. He was a symbol of resilience and coexistence.

""We at Lion Guardians feel privileged to have borne witness to his life and his legacy.

""In the following weeks and months, we hope to share the extraordinary story of Loonkiito's life with the world.

""The end of a drought is habitually marked by an uptick in human-lion conflict as wild prey recover and become more difficult to hunt.

""In desperation, lions often turn to take livestock. Since livestock owners lost so many of their animals to the drought, they are particularly vigilant in watching over their remaining animals.

""Unfortunately, Loonkito was caught up in this dynamic as he was starving and jumped into a corral in the middle of the night - this was a tough situation for both sides, the people and the lion.""

Predators such as lions have strayed closer to humans in recent years in Kenya as they face growing pressure from the expansion of of cities into their traditional hunting grounds.

Several people reacted to fury at the news.

One said: ""These situations always make me sad, while I know it's a complicated situation. I won't lie that I am annoyed and if I am honest, I have more attachment to the Lions.

""To me, losing livestock is just part of the gamble you take in raising cattle near these areas.

""It's like living in Florida and not expecting to deal with a hurricane.""

Another added: ""I am deeply saddened by this news.""

Will Young, who will enter the Love Island villa in South Africa , is known for his farming content on TikTo and has come under fire from social media trolls following his graphic videos

Love Island star Will Young has already found himself in hot water on social media and received criticism from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) before the reality show has even started.

ITV has announced its full line-up of new Islanders looking for love as the red-hot reality TV show heads to South Africa for the first series of 2023. Among those heading into the villa for a hot winter include a makeup artist, rising social media star and a rugby hunk ahead of the new winter series starting on January 16.

Maya Jama takes the presenting role after Laura Whitmore stepped down last year, while her husband Iain Stirling, continues his comical narration - a role he has had since it began airing in 2015.

The 10 singletons will enter the plush new luxury £1.2million South African mansion, which overlooks the prison where Nelson Mandela spent his jail term, and is set to spark the raunchiest series yet with a number of X-rated additions.

The 23-year-old farmer, who is known for his farming content on TikTok, has come under fire from social media trolls following his graphic videos.

Will has over 1 million followers on TikTok, where he opens up on his life as a farmer and the realities of some of the more gruesome antics on his land.

For example, the new Love Island star recently posted a video of his helping a prolapsed sheep on his family farm as he helped the pregnant animal with his bare hands in the graphic post.

In another clip, Will is seen helping a sheep in labour after the head and hooves get stuck which drew criticism from animal charity PETA and death threats from trolls.

Sharing the video in question, PETA wrote the caption on their social media channels: ""This farmer is a disgusting creep. He's dancing over her body as she gives birth.""

The fifth generation farmer responded with a video, saying: ""It was just two hooves and a head, pull it out, job done. I'd never have got the camera out for a situation I wasn't in control of.""

Will's family farm is estimated to be worth around £1.6 million and has a cottage - called The Dairy - which can be rented out for £600 for three nights on Airbnb.

*Love Island launches on Monday night (January 16) at 9pm on ITV2 and ITVX.

Richard Parry had a farm in Therese Coffey's constituency and slammed the Environment Secretary's tip for Brits to turn to turnips amid a fruit and veg shortage in supermarkets

Britain's Turnip King used to produce 30 million of the vegetable every year, but says business collapsed after the Tories came to power.

Farmer Richard Parry, who had a farm in Therese Coffey's constituency, cast doubt on Environment Secretary's suggestion that people turn to turnips to confront a lack of fruit and veg in supermarkets.

He says a combination of rising energy prices and labour shortages, partly caused by Brexit, made his turnip business financially unviable.

Reacting to Ms Coffey's claim, Richard said: ""I think she's got the wrong vegetable.""

Richard's annual crop of 30 million turnips - enough to stock all of Britain's supermarkets - earned him the title of Turnip King among his peers.

But last year he stopped farming the vegetable as costs grew greater than potential earnings. He also said he'd seen a decline in demand: ""Turnips don't have the greatest reputation, they're not a sexy vegetable. Most people don't know what to do with a turnip or even how to cook one.

""I understand the point Ms Coffey was trying to make about using British veg, but a carrot would have been a far better example,"" he added.

Richard said the number of turnips produced on his 120-hectare farm had dropped by two-thirds in the past 15 years.

And also, laws passed post - Brexit meant he struggled to staff his turnip farm, which previously had a 15-strong team handpicking the root veg.

He said: ""Labour has been more and more tricky for the last five years. We've had less people coming back to work here from Eastern Europe. ""It's harder to get hold of people because of legislation and better opportunities in mainland Europe. Brexit certainly hasn't made things any easier."" He also said his business' energy costs shot up by 25% in the last year.

But the former turnip king hasn't given up farming altogether. Richard still runs a 2,000-hectare farm in rural Suffolk but now focuses on growing spuds, onions and cereals like wheat and barley.

In an interview with ITV's Love Your Weekend programme to be broadcast on Sunday morning, Mr Starmer spoke movingly to host Alan Titchmarsh about his upbringing and his late mother's illness.

Keir Starmer is pledging to back farmers by introducing strict ""buy British"" spending rules for the public sector.

The Labour leader will promise to prevent British farms being undercut by poor quality food from overseas - after new analysis found just 1-in-5 of all pears, plums and raspberries in the UK market last year were produced in Britain. And in an interview with ITV 's Love Your Weekend programme to be broadcast on Sunday morning, Mr Starmer spoke movingly to host Alan Titchmarsh about his upbringing and his late mother's illness.

He said a Labour government would usher in a decade of national renewal - helping Britain to regain its lost its sense of hope and optimism.

""For my mum and dad, this sense that things would be better for the next generation was an incredible source of comfort and pride because they had ups and downs,"" he said. ""My mum was very, very ill for most of her life, in and out of high dependency units, they didn't have a huge amount of money, so they had the ups and downs that many, many families go through.

""But towards the end of her life the comfort they took from the fact that things we're going to get better for their children and their children's children, that allowed them to reflect and think ""˜well my life was worth living'. And we've lost that somehow. And I think this decade of national renewal will restore that sense, collective sense if you like, that we can improve where we are and again get back to that sense of hope and optimism that things will actually get better and that the next generation has even better opportunities that we have.""

Mr Starmer said Britain needed to be ""ambitious"" about food production - working with farmers to deliver food security for the country.

""We produce fantastic, high-quality food,"" he told the green-fingered TV host. ""Talk to any farmer anywhere in the country and the pride that comes with high standards in food is enormous.""

He added: ""The government can pull levers with big procurements for food into the NHS and other places. We should take pride in that, it's what drives our countryside.""

Labour's analysis found England spends £2.2bn more on imported fruit and vegetables today compared to 2010 - but has lost more than 15,000 hectares of fruit and veg planting area in the same time period. Meanwhile, the Government's free fruit and vegetable programme for primary schools is estimated to use just 13% of UK-sourced apples and 5% of UK-sourced pears, even when in season.

Labour's plan would require half of all food bought in hospitals, prisons and schools to be either locally produced, or to have higher quality and welfare standards. The Government spends billions of pounds per year on procuring food for the public sector.

Money spent on local, sustainable produce in school food public procurement can provide a return of up to four times that for the local economy. Around 3.3 million tonnes of UK food go to waste on farms ever year, enough to fill Wembley Stadium nearly 4 times.

The sector itself is struggling to stay afloat, with 7,000 agricultural businesses going bust since 2019.

Mr Starmer said: ""British farmers produce fantastic food and deliver security for our country. But they are being let down after thirteen years of Conservative failure, and consumers are faced with empty shelves. There's no metaphor of government-made damage more apt than good food left rotting in British fields during a cost-of-living crisis.

""Labour will not tolerate that. We will harness the power of public procurement to buy British, and buy sustainable, protecting our high food standards. We'll make sure that hospitals and other public bodies provide food that is high-quality and sourced in Britain when they can, while also supporting producers and boosting economic growth.

""My Labour Government will buy, make, and sell more in Britain. We'll back Britain's farmers and turn the page on 13 years of Tory failure and neglect.""

Animal Justice Project filmed for three months at Bickmarsh Hall mega-farm in Warwickshire, where 8,000 pigs are housed in 46 sheds. Some staff were seen kicking and slapping pigs when moving around

Pigs lie in cramped squalor and are left for hours to die in footage revealing the ""grim reality"" of farming.

Animal welfare campaigners say the scenes caught by a hidden camera at a Red Tractor-assured farm are some of the worst they have seen.

Animal Justice Project filmed for three months at Bickmarsh Hall mega-farm in Warwickshire, where 8,000 pigs are housed in 46 sheds.

The site rears them for pork producer Cranswick Country Foods, which supplies Asda and Tesco.

Footage shows one pig being cannibalised, while a shivering and groaning piglet is trampled on and bitten by others. Staff took up to 13 hours to remove them, Animal Justice Project said. Farrowing crates, which are legal and confine pregnant and nursing sows, were also in use and bins were piled high with corpses.

Pigs were kept in pens with no bedding, just hard slats, and investigators said many were covered in excrement. They were also documented biting and fighting, with only five feed troughs for more than 25 animals.

And cameras captured some staff kicking and slapping pigs when moving them around.

Red Tractor, which says its logos on supermarket food ""underpin high standards of British food and drink"", said its investigation found the farm was in compliance with its animal welfare standards.

It added: ""Protecting health and welfare is a top priority.""

But Animal Justice Project said some of the scenes it filmed, such as pigs unable to bear weight on all four legs, potentially break welfare regulations and industry guidelines.

Founder Claire Palmer added: ""Our footage captures the grim reality for pigs on farms in Britain.

""Consumers must be asking themselves, is a bacon sandwich or pork pie worth that?

""Red Tractor's claim that our footage shows a farm compliant with its welfare standards makes it clear this scheme is not fit for purpose. It exists to protect profit and act as a mouthpiece.""

Former pig industry vet Dr Alice Brough said the footage shows ""the epitome of squalor and unfortunately represents the norm for a large proportion of Britain's pig farms"".

Cranswick said it takes animal welfare seriously and made an unannounced audit of Bickmarsh Hall after seeing the footage.

It added: ""The unit was found to be operating to the required standard.""

Tesco and Asda said they took the allegations seriously and were investigating.

Tesco added: ""All of our pigs are reared to recognised farm assurance standards such as Red Tractor, RSPCA Assured, as well as our own.""

Kaleb Cooper, 24, explained how in order to make a profit, he has to pay himself just 50p an hour after embarking on a new venture, with the young farmer found fame alongside Jeremy Clarkson and has since gone on to write a book

Clarkson's Farm's Kaleb Cooper pays himself just 50p an hour after opening up about the challenges faced by farmers in the wake of Brexit.

The 24-year-old farming contractor from Chipping Norton won over the hearts of viewers with his passion for his work and his hilarious approach to working alongside Jeremy Clarkson.

Since finding fame as the petrolhead-turned-farmer's advisor, Kaleb has decided to step out of Jeremy's shadow and start his own venture.

The father of two has said that it's his dream to run his own farm in Oxford and has recently purchased eight calves.

However, he has spoken about how tough it is to be a farmer in Britain today and has had to take drastic measures.

""""When I'm working for myself, when I'm feeding my calves, I bought eight calves, it's a little bit of a new business idea that I'm doing,"" he told the Performance People podcast hosted by Ben and Georgie Ainslie.

""And then you feed them on milk which costs me about £200 a calf and then selling them at nine months, trying to get a profit, trying to see if it will work you know.

""But, I worked out the other day how much my hourly rate is. I pay myself 50p an hour so then I can make money.

""But if I put myself at £10 an hour I don't make money, I lose money on the calves,"" he explained.

Kaleb stars alongside Jeremy in his Amazon Prime Clarkson's Farm and Clarkson's Farm 2.

The series documents the former Top Gear host's attempts at running his 1,000 acre 'Diddly Squat' farm in a sleepy village in the Cotswolds.

""My main goal is by far to buy my own farm, you know, and then that is where the dream is,"" Cooper explained.

""The day I wake up on my own farm, walk out the front door and go ""˜On that field there, I'm gonna plant wheat.' Not because anyone tells me to because simply I want to.

""And then I can go right in that barn there, this year we're gonna go and get some pigs ""¦and I'm going to try and make money out of that. That is when the dream is complete.""

WARNING: DISTRESSING DETAILS Gloucestershire farmer Rob Jenkins lost three cows after thieves trespassed onto his land in two incidents, targeting the animals for their meat

A horrified farmer found his cows butchered in his field by thieves who slaughtered them for their meat.

Rob Jenkins made the ""horrendous"" discoveries on his farm in Gloucestershire, where the criminals trespassed on to his land and targeted three of the animals in two separate incidents. Two cows were killed in separate incidents in November and August and were already dead when Mr Jenkins found them, with five others attacked.

A third cow which was injured in the attack last month had to be put to sleep as a result of its injuries. Farmers believe the attacks - while described by police as 'rare' - are from criminals hoping to sell the meat on the black market.

Mr Jenkins told the BBC the attacks left him and his family, including his 13-year-old son, extremely distressed. ""It's horrendous, it's like losing a pet in a way,"" he said. ""It's our livelihood. I know that we're breeding them for meat, but we're giving them the best life in the time that they're alive.""

The disturbing incidents on Mr Jenkins' farm follows a similar attack in October, where two calves were slaughtered and meat removed on a farm in Frankley, Worcestershire. West Mercia Police detectives at the time said they were investigating possible links to three calves being killed the month before on another nearby farm.

Gloucestershire Police said such incidents were uncommon. ""This isn't something that Gloucestershire in general suffers from,"" Pc Phil Mawdsley from the force said. ""We have very few incidents of livestock thefts or animals being butchered in a field on a farm.""

Five further cows were attacked in the incident on November 3, one of which had its ear cut. Sadly, all that was left of the cows which were killed were their heads and insides.

""It took three or four days for the animals to calm down. I couldn't go anywhere near them. They were frightened,"" said Mr Jenkins added. Both attacks left the farmer thousands of pounds out of pocket from vets fees, as well as the loss in income.

He said the attack has cost him thousands of pounds in vet fees and lost revenue. PC Mawdsley added: ""The sooner we are notified that there is cattle or sheep missing, it gives us more chance of having an evidential lead as to what's happened there.""

The fate of Jeremy Clarkson's farm could be in for a spell of trouble after the TV presenter posted a worrying tweet concerning the upcoming winter season

TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson has issued a worrying tweet regarding the potentially poor fate of his farm following a ""harsh"" winter prediction.

The former Top Gear host, 63, took to his Instagram account and posted a picture of a Hawthorne tree that was laden with berries - and, according to his farmer pal and regular on his show Clarkson's Farm, this means a harsh winter is looming, which could spell trouble for the Diddly Squat Farm and the entire . He wrote: ""It's #backbritishfarming day. And please do because it's been a b****** of a harvest. And according to Gerald, all those berries mean we are now in for a harsh winter.""

The presenter, who owns a farm in the Cotswolds, was referencing Gerald Cooper, a local farmer who has regularly appeared on the popular documentary show. Viewers have been engaged in the dynamic between the two as Jeremy often fails to understand Gerald due to his thick West Country accent.

But Jeremy's post sparked a debate among his fans as some believed he was simply believing an old wives tale about the production of Hawthorne berries in autumn being a sign of a terrible winter. One fan wrote: ""Gerald is the philosopher of our generation."" But another seemed to aggree with Gerald and Jeremy and penned: ""Abundance of all hedgerow berries normally forecasts a hard winter.""

The star's love of farming has seen him land three series of Clarkson's Farm but not that long ago, it was speculated that Amazon bosses were not planning to commission a fourth series. This comes after his comments on Meghan Markle in his column for The Sun.

Last year he said: ""I actually feel rather sorry for him (Prince Harry) because today he's just a glove puppet with no more control over what he says or does than Basil Brush. Meghan, though, is a different story. I hate her. Not like I hate Nicola Sturgeon or Rose West. I hate her on a cellular level.""

He added: ""At night, I'm unable to sleep as I lie there, grinding my teeth and dreaming of the day when she is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while the crowds chant, 'Shame!' and throw lumps of excrement at her."" And so, on the back of his brutal comments it was believed that he was set to face the axe from the streaming platform.

Jeremy quickly issued an apology and said that his ""clumsy"" comments were in reference to the Game Of Thrones series. On his social media, he told his fans: ""I'm horrified to have caused so much hurt and I shall be more careful in future.""

But as of a few days ago, reports have surfaced claiming that the opinionated TV star will have his series renewed for the fourth time. According to Deadline, sources have said: ""Relations had improved and Amazon is in active talks with Clarkson over Season 4 of the farming documentary series, which is easily its best-performing UK original A deal is not finalised and there could yet be another plot twist, but those familiar with the matter said discussions have been positive and there is ambition on both sides to bring the show back.""

Jeremy Clarkson has taken to Twitter to address the future of the hit Amazon Prime show Clarkson's Farm after the backlash over his Meghan Markle column threw the series into jeopardy

Clarkson's Farm proved to be a huge hit with Prime Video viewers ever since the first series dropped as viewers enjoyed watching a hapless Jeremy Clarkson turn his hand to farming.

Series two landed on the streaming giant on Friday and fans are already keen to find out whether they'll be further episodes following Clarkson's controversial comments about Meghan Markle.

The former Top Gear host received a huge backlash over the comments and it was reported Amazon was planning to end its partnership with The Grand Tour presenter.

However, fans will be thrilled by Clarkson's announcement that there will be a third series of his farming adventure.

On Monday, Clarkson replied to a fan of his Prime Video show on Twitter confirming the future of the series.

The fan wrote: ""I loved it on Saturday that just passed, loved the show cant wait for a season 3 if there is one."" (sic)

The Grand Tour presenter replied: ""There is one.""

Fans of Clarkson's farming antics shared their excitement at the news as one tweeted: ""Awesome, great show. I love the serious messages and awareness the show tries to highlight through the humour. We've had farm shops, Roll on farm cooperatives and farm restaurants.""

Another said: ""Glad to here it! If Amazon tries to cancel you, I'm canceling Amazon. What you are doing is one of the most entertaining shows out there. It is also important to our civilization. People have forgotten what it takes to put food on the table and the importance of farmers/ranchers.""

""Oh my!! My wife will p*** herself knowing there's a season 3,"" a third joked. (sic)


Clarkson fans feared his popular Amazon shows would be cancelled after it was reported the streaming service was considering ""cutting ties"" with the presenter following the backlash to his column slamming Meghan Markle.

The former Top Gear presenter's column became the most complained about ever and was removed from The Sun's website at Clarkson's request.

Clarkson apologised on Twitter before releasing a lengthy statement on Instagram expanding on his apology and denied being sexiest or misogynistic.

A spokesperson for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle rejected both Clarkson's and The Sun's apology.

Kaleb Cooper, who became a sensation after appearing on the Amazon Prime show, attended a crunch No10 summit with supermarket bosses, farmers' leaders and industry executives

Clarkson's Farm star Kaleb Cooper attended a crunch Downing Street food summit hosted by Rishi Sunak today.

The TV farmer, along with ""Cheerful"" Charlie Ireland, Jeremy Clarkson's land agent and advisor, was welcomed into No10 for the Prime Minister's Farm to Fork conference, alongside supermarket bosses, industry chiefs and Whitehall officials.

Kaleb, 24, became famous for his blunt put downs to Jeremy Clarkson on the hit Amazon Prime show.

More used to sitting aboard tractors rolling across the Oxfordshire countryside and around Clarkson's 1,000-acre Diddly Squat holding, Kaleb took his seat at the summit aimed at boosting production and slashing shelf prices for hard-up families.

Rishi Sunak's spokesman said: ""He was in and obviously that programme has been important in raising some of the issues that farmers face.

""Some of the policies set out today will support the farming sector.""

The PM said: ""I will always back British farmers, and I pay tribute to their hard work and dedication all year round which keeps shelves stocked and food on our tables.

""Supporting our farmers and food producers must, and always will be, at the heart of our plans to grow the economy and build a more prosperous country.

""That's why I'm proud to host this summit, and working together, I'm determined to build resilience, strengthen our food security and champion the best of British at home and overseas.""No10 said the PM used the summit to ""make the point that supporting the countryside, supporting farmers is not simply seeking to hark back to the past or more rural Britain - it's vital to everyone in the UK both in terms of food security, growing the economy and creating more jobs"".

Mr Sunak earlier told the Cabinet the event focused ""on how government and industry can best work together for a thriving food sector here in the UK"", his spokesman said.

""He said this was not about some nostalgic vision of the UK's rural past"", the spokesman added.

Clarkson used a recent Sunday Times column to reveal his ""last roll of the dice"" as he faces financial worries over the future of Diddly Squat, in the Cotswolds.

The presenter wrote: ""On top of the physical issues, which will only get worse, there are financial problems too. And they're going to get worse as well.

""Because the grants and subsidies that I used to get from the EU, to recompense me for selling food at a loss, are dwindling until, in three years' time, they will dry up completely. These, then, are troubling times, because what am I to do?

""Farming hurts my back and my knees, and if I attempt to use my land to grow food, I'll lose money. It has been causing me some sleepless nights, that's for sure.""

Environment Secretary Therese Coffey said newly-announced measures, including a £30million investment in new technologies, were about putting ""more British produce on supermarket shelves and plates"".

Will Young, from Buckinghamshire, has been confirmed as one of the new Love Island contestants as the winter series kicks off on Monday

Animal rights charity PETA has criticised an upcoming Love Island hopeful who will be entering the winter villa next week, as they claimed he ""exploits"" animals for his TikTok.

Will Young, from Buckinghamshire, has been confirmed as one of the new Islanders on the ITV reality show as the winter series kicks off on Monday, presented by new host Maya Jama.

The 23-year-old boasts 1.1million followers on his TikTok, who see him post clips from life on his farm,

Yet animal welfare organisation PETA re-shared a 2020 clip of Will, which he has since deleted from his TikTok account, which sees him dancing around a sheep giving birth before moving the newborn lamb to the music.

Re-sharing the clip to Instagram, the organisation wrote: ""This farmer is a disgusting creep!

""He's dancing over her body as she gives birth! Then he forces the second-old baby to ""˜dance' for clout on TikTok.""

A representative of PETA has since said that the fifth generation farmer should be ashamed of posting TikTok dances with a seconds-old lamb for ""social media click bait"".

PETA Vice President of Programmes Elisa Allen told The Sun: ""Women want a man who cares about animals, not someone who exploits them for their fleece, their flesh, or social media clickbait.

""Mr Young might want to consider that the cholesterol in meat and dairy can clog the arteries to all organs, not just the heart - and switch to a vegan diet if he wants to please his partner in the villa or later in his life.""

Will's family farm is estimated to be worth around £1.6 million and has a cottage - called The Dairy - which can be rented out for £600 for three nights on Airbnb.

Will is one of the 10 singletons who will enter the plush new luxury £1.2million South African mansion next week.

ITV has announced its full line-up of new Islanders looking for love as the red-hot reality TV show heads to warmer climes for the first series of 2023.

Among those heading into the villa for a hot winter include a makeup artist, rising social media star and a rugby hunk as the new winter series starting on January 16.

Maya Jama takes the presenting role after Laura Whitmore stepped down last year, while her husband Iain Stirling, continues his comical narration - a role he has had since it began airing in 2015.

People in Kent woke up to a pink glowing hue in the sky on Thursday that looked like it had come from a sci-fi film and one person fretted it could be ""the end of the world""

Brits were left fearing it was ""the end of the world"" after the sky lit up a mysterious glowing pink colour this morning in Kent.

It appeared like it was straight out of a sci-fi film with images showing the pinkish hue in the sky over Thanet on Thursday. Puzzled locals were left guessing as to what could be behind the phenomenon. Pictures taken just before dawn show the sky looking very unusual. In one photo, taken outside Bethany's Sandwich Bar and Cafe in Westgate, the sky was completely filled with the pinkish colour, with a point of origin in the distance. Sharing the images online one person joked: ""Thought it was the end of the world, was looking for the four horsemen,"" while another said: ""It's just Zuul from Ghostbusters.""

The reason for the display has now been identified and while the scenes looked like they were from a movie, the answer is actually based on science with it being artificial light from an agricultural company growing 400 million tomatoes. Thanet Earth is a large industrial factory located in Birchington on the Isle of Thanet - it's the biggest greenhouse complex in the country, covering 90 acres of land, reported KentLive.

According to the Thanet Earth website: ""Britain's leading glasshouse complex sits proudly within the landscape of East Kent. These enormous glasshouses are estimated to produce around 400 million tomatoes, 30 million cucumbers and 24 million peppers each year.

""Innovation, environmental concern and a focus on quality combine with cutting-edge technology, international expertise and the best growing conditions in the UK to produce unrivalled taste on a commercial scale.""

The South East was chosen for the large complex due to its longer sunlight hours, benefiting the growing plants. However, British winters still pose a challenge as plants need light, so artificial alternatives are used during this time of year.

A spokesperson from Thanet Earth explained: ""As a responsible local business, we constantly monitor the way our business affects the community around us and during certain weather conditions there will inevitably be some light that reflects, particularly when there is low dense cloud cover over the Thanet area.

""We mitigate this light reflection as much as possible by deploying blinds in our glasshouses once the lights are switched on. We continually assess our operations and their impact on the community and the pink LED lights we use here at Thanet Earth have much lower emission levels compared to other types of growing lights.""

It's the mass reflection of the pink LED growing lights caused by low cloud coverage that results in the phenomenon, which Thanet Earth says can make the facility ""become a spooky, glowing landmark."" So, no need to call the Ghostbusters, Thanet hasn't been invaded by any supernatural beings.

Slow cookers are one of our kitchen heroes; they're convenient, cost-effective and time-saving, making them a big hit in many households.

They usually allow for one-step preparation; putting all the ingredients in the slow cooker saves time and reduces clean-up. And a variety of foods can be cooked in a slow cooker, from soups, stews and side dishes, to mains, meats, and desserts.

But, just like any cooking tool, it's important to take precautions to ensure the food you are cooking is bacteria-free. And there's one common mistake that many people make that can lead to serious food-poisoning.

Placing frozen meats, vegetables or prepared meals in a slow cooker is definitely not recommended, as it may take them too long to fully thaw and begin cooking.

This can mean leaving the food at an unsafe temperature for an extended period of time, which can allow bacteria to grow and potentially cause illness, according to Meredith Carothers, a public affairs specialist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Instead, it is best to first thaw frozen ingredients in the fridge, in cold water or in the microwave. The only exception is if you are using a commercially prepared slow-cooked meal that instructs you to place the ingredients in the slow cooker while they're still frozen.

Similarly, the danger of reheating cooked foods in a slow cooker is that it may take too long to reheat them to a safe temperature. ""When it's cooking, there's that time-temperature relationship that cooks it within a certain amount of time versus reheating it,"" Meredith told AARP. ""It's just an extra safety measure to make sure that you're reheating something quickly and efficiently versus putting it into a slow cooker.""

One woman previously found herself very ill after making a vegan stew with her slow cooker. Anne Sullivan found a white bean stew recipe and diligently followed all the instructions - including pre-soaking the beans, then letting them simmer all day in the slow cooker.

However, seven hours later, the beans were still the same size. Anne still took a bowlful to work with her anyway and ate it, even though the beans were tough and chewy. She began to feel faint and dizzy, adding: ""I must have looked awful, too, because my boss told me to go home and get some sleep. I felt like throwing up.""

Even though Anne had pre-soaked the beans and let them stew for hours, they were still undercooked. This meant a naturally occurring toxin called phytohaemagglutinin was even more potent than normal, and was causing symptoms like diarrhoea, dizziness and nausea.

What Anne should have done was soak the beans for five hours, drained, rinsed, then boiled them for ten minutes. By whacking them in the slow cooker straight away she actually increased the toxin levels. ""I had no idea - I think most people assume beans will cook in a slow cooker. Most recipes seem to assume you're using canned beans, which are fully cooked.""

Apparently, there is one spice in particular that can be found in curries that aids in weight loss. Experts say it controls the system that regulates the way fat is broken and energy is made in the muscles and liver

Instead of sipping on meal replacement shakes and throwing back weight loss pills, there is a much tastier way to lose weight - and it involves eating curry. Recent studies have shown that curries could help to support people's weight loss goals thanks to one special ingredient. According to researchers, eating cardamom in food can play a crucial role in burning calories, reducing inflammation, maintaining weight and curbing appetite.

Cardamom is a spice that can be used in both savoury and sweet dishes, including curries, desserts and chai. It's also present in a number of spice mixtures, including curry powder and garam masala. According to experts, it promotes weight loss by regulating the system that regulates the way fat is broken down and how energy is produced in the muscles and liver. Scientists at the Institute for Advancing Health Through Agriculture at Texas A&M AgriLife evaluated the effects of cardamom in mice and they noted that the ingredient helped the creatures feel less hungry. As well as this, they noticed that the spice made them energetic and helped them burn fat.

The rodents whose diet consisted of more than one per cent of cardamom powder ate more than those who did not eat as much of the spice. Even though they put on weight during the experiment, there was a decrease in fat mass, suggesting that the spice may be effective in treating obesity. The study, which was published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, indicated that the spice could also aid in reducing low-grade inflammation which might contribute to the risk of diabetes, arthritis and heart disease.

Even though these outcomes were shown in mice, it was noted that adults weighing roughly 60kg would require approximately 77mg of cardamom to reap the weight loss benefits. This would mean consuming 10 cardamom pods a day. This isn't the first time the spice's benefits have been spoken about, as it's previously been shown that it can ease inflammation and protect your cells against oxidative stress, which is an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants that can lead to a number of medical issues. The benefits don't end there, as it can also help your body handle insulin better and keep your blood pressure healthy.

That being said, the NHS recommends consuming a varied diet and incorporating exercise in order to lose weight. ""Keeping active has many benefits to your health and wellbeing and when part of a healthy diet, can be an effective way to lose weight. It's recommended that all adults should try to be active every day and should complete at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week,"" it states on the website.

Food safety managers - also known as food inspectors - are the silent heroes of restaurants and grocery stores, saving would-be patrons and customers from disastrous food purchases.

In the US, food inspectors help locations follow the strict guidelines the Food and Drug Administration have set in place to ensure that food meets quality standards.

Food safety inspectors are often the first line of defence when it comes to identifying salmonella and E.coli breakouts, undergoing intense training in order to best identify problem areas. According to the US Department of Agriculture's website, there are nearly 11,000 people employed by the Food Safety and Inspection Service - the agency responsible for inspecting food in the US.

It would make sense, then, that food inspectors would be one of the go-to sources for help identifying what food items to stay away from when next going to the grocery store.

Unpasteurized (Raw) Milk

Unpasteurized milk is a drink food safety regulators tend to not go near, as the milk has not gone through the heating process that kills pathogens, extends shelf life and makes the drink safer for consumption.

As a result, this milk - also called raw milk - is home to an abundance of harmful germs like salmonella, E. coli, listeria, brucella and more, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""Although it is possible to purchase raw, unpasteurized milk in some states, I recommend people not consume it,"" professor Kali Kniel, a microbiologist at the University of Delaware, said to Huffington Post, adding that it is hard to tell when a product is contaminated with a pathogenic microbe as the food won't smell or look different. This tosses the trusted 'sniff test' down the drain.

Dr. Bryan Quoc Le , a food chemist and consultant based in Washington, added:""There are a lot of people who tout [raw] milk as having all these health benefits, but it's just not worth the risk because there are a lot of pathogenic organisms that are still alive in that milk, especially if it's coming straight from a processing facility.""

The sale of raw milk is illegal in several states, including Alabama and Colorado. States like California, Maine, New Mexico and Pennsylvania, however, allow the sale of raw milk. The Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund provides a state-by-state breakdown on raw milk sales.

Raw Sprouts

While experts don't advise to stay fully away from sprouts, they do warn that it is crucial to wash all products before eating them as they can contain harmful bacteria like E. coli and salmonella. Sprouts consist of things like radish, alfalfa and clover.

""In order for sprouts to germinate, the seeds cannot be adequately disinfected to kill all the salmonella that could be there, for example,"" Kniel said. ""But, in saying this, let's keep in mind that there are sprouts growers who are doing a great job and pay close attention to cleaning and sanitation.""

Le is a little more sceptical than his counterpart. ""There seem to be more foodborne issues with sprouts and I think that is because of the desire not to use chemicals because of the type of consumers who like to buy them,"" he said. ""The probability of contamination is not so high, it's more of a moderate risk, but I personally would avoid them.""

Pre-cut Produce

Kniel was starkly against cut melons, noting that they are the most susceptible to contamination for a number of reasons: They grow on the grown and get infected water trapped in them. They can also get into contact with animal faeces. Melon and cantaloupe skin is also susceptible to bacteria growth as pathogens can stick and possibly penetrate the rind.

""If you're going to eat pre-cut produce raw, you are dealing with the same amount of microbial risk as you would with sprouts,"" Le added.

""That's because I don't know what the person behind the counter has done while cutting the produce and what practices they implement. Packaged food, by law, has to go through a stringent process but food that has been produced on-site doesn't necessarily.""

Both experts advised that a thorough clean and proper storage would help with avoiding deadly bacteria. They also said that cooking the produce was also an option.

Hot Food Bars

Food preparation is key when looking at the hot food served at delis and grocery stores, with the most crucial rule being that all food be kept at a temperature of 135 degrees Fahrenheit or higher or below 41 degrees Fahrenheit if being kept cold.

""If the heating system is questionable, I would avoid the hot food bar,"" Le said. ""But if it is kept above the proper temperature then you are OK eating it because it can't be contaminated.""

Kniel added: ""I look to see that the sneeze guard is in place and clean and that tongs are clean and available. I want to see that the tongs are being handled carefully by my fellow consumers.""

The expert also highlighted the importance of keeping turnover in mind and being mindful of when food will be replenished, often around lunch or dinner hours. Food during ""off hours,"" might not be the best as the ""foods may have been sitting there longer and you may be more careful with your choices.""

Tony Harvey has been ordered to demolish his £500,000 home that was built without permission near Glastonbury as neighbours claim that it ""lit up like a Christmas tree"" at night

A landowner has been ordered to teardown a £500,000 home built illegally after neighbours said it ""lit up like a Christmas tree"" at night.

Tony Harvey, did not get planning permission for his house near Glastonbury with it lying on agricultural land above the village of West Compton. He says that it is in keeping with the location and is only one storey but other residents are not happy.

A mechanic by profession who runs a garage, Mr Harvey was reportedly told last year that the building was illegal by council officials. And while he then applied for retrospective permission for the property as either a residential or agricultural workers' dwelling they were rejected.

He is now appealing against the decision and a planning inspectorate will make a ruling that has caused tension in the local community with most people against it.

One person said its large windows ""lit up like a Christmas tree"" at night when lights were on, reported the Mail, and another said: ""When he puts the lights it is lit up and looks like an alien invasion from Mars"".

There have also reportedly been complaints that the building of the property has led to water from the field running into the road and making driving dangerous. Stuart Vaughan, 77, said: 'He has built a fairly fancy building which has fantastic views. But it is very much visible to the whole of West Compton because it is on top of the ridge.

'It has got glass overlooking these fantastic views. There are no street lights in West Compton and no light pollution so when he puts the lights on it is lit up and it looks like an alien invasion from Mars. Because of where it is, the building has changed the contours around the property and there is a lot of water now running off the field into the road.""

Mr Harvey's planning agent said the property benefits the area. James Whilding, of Acorus Rural Property Services Limited, reportedly said in a planning report: ""The design seeks to provide housing of exceptional quality with high quality design, construction and material quality. The proposed development has been designed and considered to reflect that of a contemporary modern home, designed with Passivhaus [energy efficient] principles in mind.""

Another local resident Dr Michael Mayhew downplayed the suggestion that Mr Harvey should have the property so that he could remain in the area as a local employer, but he argued that he didn't have a good connection with the village as he had never seen him. But Rob Smith a customer at Mr Harvey's garage reportedly claimed that objections were down to nimbyism as he supported the property being allowed.

A spokesperson from Somerset Council reportedly said: ""The Local Planning Authority, having carefully considered the grounds for refusal, consider it expedient and an enforcement notice has been issued requiring the property to be demolished and the land restored back to an agricultural field."" The Mirror has contacted Somerset Council for comment.

Missing two-year-old Ã‰mile Soleil was last seen on July 8 before he vanished without a trace while staying with his grandparents in Haut-Vernet, in France, with the search called off last Wednesday

Police are fearing a missing toddler may have been hit by a combine harvester while walking through long grass. Ã‰mile Soleil went missing on July 8 on holiday in France.

The two-year-old was staying with his grandparents in Haut-Vernet, an Alpine hamlet south of Grenoble. On Monday, prosecutor Remy Avon said officers are looking to 'investigate causes of the worrying disappearance'.

Some scenarios have already been ruled out, such as a bird of prey or wolf attack. A total of 20 houses have been searched, but nothing was found.

Now the police are investigating the scenario in which Ã‰mile would have come into contact with an agricultural machine. A farmer from the village of Le Vernet, where the search is taking place, told BFMTV that it would not be an illogical scenario.

He explained: ""Sometimes we find deer. The little one may have ended up in the tall grass and been hit by a farm machine. That would be terrible.""

The countryside search for missing Ã‰mile was called off on Wednesday evening last week, after four days.

Hundreds of gendarmes, police and volunteers had been involved in a vast operation beating fields and bushes, and examining them from the air.

Avon said that the 'physical search' could go no further, because there was 'no sign' of Ã‰mile, adding: ""The judicial investigation into the causes of the disappearance will continue, in particular by analysing the considerable mass of information and elements collected over the past four days.""

He said the possibilities that Ã‰mile had been murdered, kidnapped, or got involved in an accident were all being looked at. ""All these theories are active,"" said Mr Avon. ""Nothing has been ruled out.""

The police have released a photo and description of Emile, who is almost 3ft tall, with brown eyes, and blond hair. He was wearing a yellow top, white shorts with a green pattern, and hiking shoes at the time of his disappearance.

Quarantine has been imposed in an area in Florida to combat an invasive infestation of giant African land snails that threaten agriculture, pets and humans alike

Giant African land snails that could carry parasites that cause meningitis in humans have been discovered in yards, prompting authorities to take action.

The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) and its Division of Plant Industry have established a quarantine and treatment area in Broward County, Florida, in response to the detection of giant African land snails in Miramar.

The giant African land snails, notorious for their destructive appetite, have been wreaking havoc on over 500 different plant species.

With Florida's lush tropical and subtropical environments at stake, the snails pose a significant threat to agriculture, pets and humans.

The quarantine prohibits the movement of these snails or regulated articles within or from the designated area without a compliance agreement.

Regulated articles include plants, plant parts, soil, yard waste, debris, compost, or building materials.

The giant African land snail is known for being highly destructive to plants, posing a significant threat to agriculture and natural areas in Florida.

They can cause extensive damage to tropical and subtropical environments and they could also carry the rat lungworm parasite, which can cause meningitis in humans.

To combat the infestation, FDACS will use a metaldehyde-based molluscicide, commonly known as snail bait.

Residents and businesses in the quarantine area are urged to comply with the regulations and cooperate with authorities to prevent further spread.

Importing or possessing giant African land snails without a permit is illegal in the United States.

Residents in the area expressed their surprise and concern upon discovering giant African land snails on their properties.

One resident, Vivian, came across a snail without realizing the potential danger it posed.

Trevor Smith, a representative from the FDACS, stressed that the giant African land snails pose a threat not only to agriculture but also to human health.

""I just assumed it was a big snail. Not thinking anything of it,"" she told 7News. ""I was a little bit scared, like, ""˜Where did they come from?'""

Another resident, Kiwana Jones, said she accidentally stepped on one of the snails and became alarmed.

She said: ""We accidentally stepped on one of the snails, and I was like, ""˜What is this?'And then we kind of turned around and there is like a whole area over there with snails. Like the size of your wrist, like literally.""

And added: ""I have a dog, I have children, I have a neighbour next door who does a lot of gardening, and I kinda look out for him, and he is always digging. My first thought was safety.""

Student Neil Graham was working underneath the wheels of a Massey Ferguson in May 2018 when the engine was started, which caused it to jump and cause him fatal injuries

A ""wholly innocent"" teenage trainee mechanic was tragically killed ""in utterly appalling and tragic circumstances"" when he was crushed to death by a tractor during a work placement.

The death of Neil Graham, 17, on a farm has led to fines totalling £50,000 for health and safety breaches for a family farming business as a judge branded the fatal incident as ""heartbreaking"" and ""monumentally tragic"".

Neil, was on a work placement with 63-year-old Gordon Brown's agricultural engineering firm and on the day in question was working on a Massey Ferguson brought in for repair by Jamie Loane's family farming business - C&V Loane Limited

Crown barrister Philip Mateer KC told Dungannon Crown Court faults were reported in the tractor's gearing mechanism and Mr Brown instructed the teenager to wash the vehicle before any repairs could begin.

As the young mechanic was backing the tractor into the workshed, Brown noticed an oil leak and then rolled in underneath the tractor to attend to it.

Mr Mateer told the court that Mr Brown then ""took the fatal decision to start that tractor"" - this caused it to jump forward causing fatal injuries to the teenager.

Regarding the charges, Mr Mateer said Mr Brown's failing included not warning the young mechanic, who was under the wheels, that he was about to start the engine as well as not using an inspection pit on the workshop.

When the tractor was later examined, it emerged that a safety feature to prevent the vehicle being started while in gear had been bypassed some time before it was brought in for repair.

Mr Brown later stated he was unaware of the modification and would not have allowed Neil anywhere near it had he known.

A second Massey Ferguson with similar modifications was located at the Loane family farm, with the Crown saying the company failed to have any system in place to inspect the vehicles.

Mr Mateer said that while Mr Loane, 27, claims he was not aware of the alteration to the safety mechanism, as the main user he was ""under duty ... to make himself aware"" of any alternations, and pass that information on to anyone who would be affected.

The prosecutor said: ""Neil Graham tragically lost his life as a result of central failings attributable in several ways to the defendants.""

South West College student Neil , who was 17, was killed on May 22, 2018, in Enniskillen, in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland.

At Dungannon Crown Court, sitting in Belfast, Northern Ireland, Judge Ramsey imposed the fines to two County Fermanagh men and a farming business.

Mr Brown, of Enniskillen, admitted a charge of being an employer and failing to provide a safe system of work and was fined £20,000.

Mr Loane, 27, from the village of Kesh in Enniskillen, pleaded guilty to a charge of being an employee and failing to take reasonable care for the health and safety of himself and others. He was fined £10,000.

Mr Loane's family farming business - C&V Loane Limited of the same address in Kesh - admitted a charge of failing to ensure a non-employee was not exposed to risks to health and safety. It was also fined £20,000 by Judge Ramsey.

Martin O'Rourke KC, representing Mr Brown, said his client acknowledged the ""catastrophic impact"" Graham's death has had on his family and friends, and also wanted to pass on his condolences.

The barrister said the incident has also had a ""significant"" impact on Mr Brown's health and that prior to this incident there had never been any safety issues in his long-established business.

Frank O'Donoghue KC, acting on behalf of Jamie Loane and C&V Loane Limited, added his clients condolences to the Graham family for the death of a ""wholly innocent young man whose life has been lost in these utterly appalling and tragic circumstances"".

The barrister said that while it was acknowledged by the Loane family that the Massey Ferguson brought to Brown was in a bad condition, they were not aware the modification had been made.

As he imposed fines, Judge Ramsey said: ""I'm aware that today's proceedings will do little to ease the grief of the family - but hopefully this will give them some degree of closure. It's quite clear that everybody's thoughts in this courtroom will be with the deceased and his family.""

Recalling the day of the fatal incident, dad Eddie said: ""He went off to work that morning and he was so happy, but our world shattered that day.

""I got a call later to tell me Neil had been in an accident in work and I tried to find out what happened. I thought he's nicked himself or something so I just rushed to the hospital.

""I was met at the door by three police officers and they didn't need to tell me then as I just knew.

""He will never become a mechanic, he will never get married and have children.""

Thunder bugs typically appear in muggy hot weather and, because they are attracted to bright colours, they often go into flower buds in our gardens to feed and then reproduce

Brits are set to enjoy a warm weekend with temperatures expected to exceed 30C in parts of the country today - but forecasters have also warned of the risk of storms due to hot weather conditions.

The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms covering most of Britain from 9am until midnight on Sunday.

Brits have been warned that heavy showers and thunderstorms could cause damage to some buildings due to floodwater, lightning strikes, hail or strong winds.

Another warning covers all of Northern Ireland from 10am until 9pm on Sunday, with flooding and travel disruption likely in the region, forecasters said.

Warm temperatures also bring with them a rise in the number of insects in our gardens, with muggy weather particularly attracting thunder bugs, Bristol Live reports.

The little black bugs, which grow to be no longer than a couple of millimetres, seem to all of a sudden appear everywhere - and are particularly attracted to flowers as they are drawn to bright colours.

They often go into the buds to feed and then reproduce, spreading in big numbers across gardens.

Some species can bite, but most of them are harmless and just affect plans. To see if thunder bugs have been on your plants, check if you can see any silver patches or black dots.

Another sign that the bugs may have attacked your plant is if you see new growth becoming brown, curling and looking distorted.

The creepy crawlies are called thunder bugs as they appear in hot weather, after migrating from cereal crops.

They tend to appear when thunderstorms are due but usually, this is really a coincidence and a matter of them being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

To avoid the bugs going onto your flowers, you could opt to place brightly coloured sticky cards around your garden so that they can see them.

If you hang some sticky cards over outdoor furniture or sturdy plants, the insects will be attracted to them.

According to goodgardn.co.uk, another way to get rid of thunder bags is to shake branches so that they will fall out - and then catch the bugs by placing a cloth underneath your tree or plant.

Other options are using biological control, removing weeds from your garden, as well as pruning and watering your plants regularly.

The Met Office said: ""Heavy showers and thunderstorms are expected on Saturday, during the morning mainly over parts of England before becoming mainly focused over northern England and Scotland by late afternoon/evening.

""Some intense downpours are likely and whilst rainfall accumulations will vary from place to place, as much as 50 mm of rain could fall in a short space of time in some locations. Hail, lightning and gusty winds will be additional hazards.""

The Met Office has issued a 48-hour heat alert covering the UK this weekend. The forecasters and UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA), are warning Brits to stay safe in the sun over the next few days.

While the heat burst could be shortlived, vulnerable Brits could suffer some serious health consequences.

Met Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Dan Harris said a plume of ""very warm air"" would prompt the heat surge. The six regions covered by the warning include London, South East, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England and Yorkshire and the Humber.

UK 5 day weather forecast

Today:

Another hot day in the east, but rain and thunderstorms spreading across many areas for a time, especially in the north and east during the afternoon. Windy in the northwest. Feeling fresher from the southwest later.

Tonight:

Heavy showers, carrying a risk of hail and thunder, will gradually ease, although a continued risk of rain across Scotland. Clearer skies elsewhere, and feeling cooler than previous nights.

Sunday:

Rain across Scotland easing and a bright start elsewhere. Showers developing into the afternoon, often heavy and thundery. Feeling fresher than Saturday with lighter winds.

Outlook for Monday to Wednesday:

Remaining unsettled into next week with a risk of heavy showers and perhaps the odd rumble of thunder. Sunny spells in between and temperatures close to the seasonal average.

Tomato seeds are topping bestseller lists on Amazon as well as Waitrose, with Asda currently out of stock as supermarkets struggle to keep the shelves filled with vegetables and salad items

People across the UK are scrabbling to get their hands on tomato seeds to grow their own as supermarkets struggle to keep the shelves filled with vegetables and salad items.

Online retailer Amazon has seen orders for packets of the seeds shoot up and they've hit the best sellers list.

They are top of the website's list in the garden section and dominate the top 10 in the vegetable seeds section.

It comes as food experts warn the shortages in tomatoes may last until late April, but also coincides with the time amateur gardens will be looking to start their summer crops either in a greenhouse or on a windowsill.

Some UK supermarkets have placed limits on how many fruit and vegetables customers can buy due to supply issues.

Tomato seeds also topped the best-sellers in vegetable seeds on the Waitrose website and Asda has seen some of its tomato seed varieties are already out of stock.

Tesco has currently run out of mini tomato plants for customers to buy too.

The UK government has said the shortage of tomatoes and other vegetables is largely down to bad weather in Europe and Africa.

In the winter months, the UK imports 95% of its tomatoes.

The soaring cost of energy and fertiliser also derived from gas has put British growers off planting tomatoes in glasshouses over winter - adding to the shortage.

Other vegetables which have taken a knock on supply are peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, broccoli and cauliflowers.

The Royal Horticultural Society says ""growing your own tomatoes is simple and just a couple of plants will reward you with plenty of delicious tomatoes through the summer.

""They're ideal for growing in containers, either outdoors in a sunny spot or in a greenhouse, and there's a whole array to try, from tiny sweet cherry tomatoes to full-flavoured giant beefsteaks.""

It advises gardeners to sow their seeds any time from now to the end of April, for have edible fruits from July through to September.

It also tells growers to ""check seed packets or plant labels before buying, to ensure you get the right type to suit your needs"".

Someone parking across your driveway can be enough to send some drivers mad, however there are few things people can do to get around the situation, according to the Highway Code

Finding a car parked across your driveway can be one of the most irritating things facing motorists - but people have rights should it transpire.

The issue crops up for people should they live near train stations or major sporting arenas where parking is at a premium.

There is no criminal law against the indecent act of someone parking on your driveway without their consent, according to the RAC.

Because a driveway is part of the property the driver is committing an act of trespassing.

However, trespassing is classed as a civil offence so police do not have the power to make an arrest.

But what are you actually allowed to do to the offending vehicle? Worryingly little, it turns out.

Charlotte Dixon, solicitor at DAS Law, previously said: ""The first step with any anti-social parking problem is to contact your local authority or the police.

""However there is little the law can do to support home owners - even if a car blocks your driveway.

""The Highway Code can only help if the parked car is causing an obstruction to the road but not in relation to private land.""

""One option that's available is to pursue a legal claim for nuisance on the grounds that the driver is interfering with your use and enjoyment of your property - but to do so you'd need to know the identity of the offending vehicle's driver.""

Even with signage or cameras, people will still try and park on people's driveways to make their journey easier or to save money.

At one point in time, parking enforcement was handled by the police, but after a 1991 law change, local authorities were given the responsibility.

They are able to issue fines and penalty charge notices for any offence on a public highway, including if a car is blocking a driveway while parked on a public road.

However, if a car is on a drive, and on private property, the council has no authority to move it.

If a car has been abandoned, the local council is required to move it regardless of whether it is on public or private land.

But if the car has up-to-date tax, insurance, a valid MOT and isn't in a dangerous condition, councils are ""powerless"" to intervene.

Key legal facts about blocked driveways at a glance

If a vehicle is parked on your driveway without your permission, they would be trespassing. As trespass is a civil and not criminal offence the police will not always get involved. They can send an officer to try and determine the owner of the vehicle and ask them to move.

A homeowner has no special legal right to park directly outside their property. All road users have the same right to park anywhere on the public highway as long as they do not contravene parking restrictions.

There is no time limit on how long a vehicle can remain parked in the same space on a road. The exception to this is if the vehicle is thought to have been abandoned, in which case it can be removed by the police.

Trying to keep a parking space available outside your home using cones or some other obstacle could be viewed as obstruction and liable to prosecution - unless your local authority has granted you the right to do so for something like a funeral.

If someone has parked on your driveway and you were to block them in, be careful not to cause an obstruction to the public highway as this is a criminal offence. If you do, the owner of the vehicle could call the police on you.

Vandalising a parked car is a criminal act and can be prosecuted. Even if just spraying chip fat on the windscreen or blocking the exhaust, these acts could still be classed as vandalism.

Leonid Andreev was found dead in his home after suffering from a fatal heart attack. He weighed 620 pounds - more than three baby elephants - and told his friends a day before that he was planning a new life in the city

A 620-pound man who lived on a sofa and had not left his remote home in five years has been found dead from a heart attack.
The body of Leonid Andreev, 60, who weighed more than three baby elephants, was discovered in his village home in Armizonskoye, Russia, on November 17.

Just a day before his death, Andreev had told local media how he was planning a new life of losing weight and moving to a city apartment. He said: ""I tried to lose at least a little weight - I ate less and did not indulge in flour products.""

Andreev had started a new diet with just a cup of light soup for lunch. Astonishingly, Andreev told reporters that he once used to be an athlete, weighing in at just 155 pounds. Ten years ago, he was a hunter, ran his own farm, and took part in harvesting the crops.

His weight problems began, he said, when he left a career in the army. In just three months, his weight nearly doubled to 235 pounds, and it never stopped going up. Doctors apparently told Andreev that his weight gain was caused by a metabolic disorder.

But five years ago his weight had ballooned so much he had to quit work and began his reclusive life on the sofa.
In an ongoing health crisis, his blood pressure soared so high he called for an ambulance. But after controlling his symptoms paramedics refused further aid because of Andreev's weight. For five years, said Andreev, he lived and slept on his sofa watching TV all day while neighbours helped clean and take care of his house.

He said: ""In the morning, I get up, cook food, eat a little, watch TV. Tried to move here, move there. I used to have porridge - the heaviest, well, and buns, potatoes, bread. That's how I got fat, probably.""

Andreev was married and divorced twice and had no children. Doctors had warned him he had to lose at least 110 pounds to be able to live normally again, warnings that he apparently did not act on until it was too late.

After filming in Brazil's Cerrado grassland had ended, the mum Nhorinha and two pups were discovered drowned in one of the drainage ditches

The mother maned wolf and two of the three pups featured in tonight's Planet Earth III were found dead shortly after filming ended.

The tragic discovery came after film-makers and scientific researchers had tracked the shy, fruit-eating mammals in Brazil's Cerrado grassland, and were delighted to achieve a record first by filming inside a den.

But once the BBC crew had left, following a three-year collaboration with local scientists, the mother wolf Nhorinha and two pups were discovered drowned in one of the drainage ditches on neighbouring farmland.

In the story sequence, which also featured in the Making Of""¦ section at the end of last night's Deserts & Grasslands episode on BBC1, viewers saw how the wolves were under intense threat from farmers who use fire to clear the grassland in order to grow huge swathes of crops.

The wolves, which are red in colour and have especially long legs, have already lost 50% of their habitat in Pousada Trijuncao.

Producer and Director Kiri Cashell said: ""The death of our maned wolf, Nhorinha, and her puppies is truly heart-breaking. We spent three years working with scientists to better understand this species, and the footage we were able to capture from inside the den provides such an intimate look into the first few weeks of these puppies' lives.

""Sadly since filming ended, we have discovered that the mother and two of her puppies fell into drainage ditches which are used to feed the crops of neighbouring farmland. Unable to escape, the wolves drowned.""

Kiri said that the deaths were not isolated because a number of the wolves wearing the electronic tracking collars had already been found dead. ""It's a really sad representation of what's going on, and a reflection of the big problem facing the whole species,"" she said.

""More and more, farmland is encroaching onto the Cerrado. This is a vitally important grassland and some predict it could disappear completely in the next thirty years. The death of these maned wolves is an upsetting and poignant reminder of what could be lost.""

In proportion to its size, the Cerrado is being destroyed more than two times faster than the Amazon rainforest to clear land for farming.

In the programme, narrator Sir David Attenborough explained that if the maned wolves disappeared altogether from the region it could trigger the collapse of the entire ecosystem. He warned: ""At the current rate of habitat destruction, these may be some of the last maned wolves to survive in the wild.""

Researcher Barbara Do Conto Peret Dias said that conservationists were working hard to find solutions. ""I feel quite worried but not hopeless,"" she said. ""I grew up here, it's my home, I have to protect it.""

A family has beaten the cost of living crisis in the UK after buying a rural home in County Mayo, Ireland, where they grow their own food in a new sustainable lifestyle

A family has ditched the rat race and ""fallen in love"" with a country home in Ireland, where they grow their own food and are creating an ""off-grid experience"" in the cost of living crisis.

Amy Johnson, 34, and husband Peter, 46, decided they wanted a new start during the Covid pandemic and moved to Co Mayo.

They left with their four children and bought a six-acre property for â‚¬230,000 (£200,000) after selling their previous home in Lincolnshire for £275,000.

The family now lives self-sufficiently off the land it owns, growing fruit and vegetables, and fetching water from a well.

They estimate they're now saving roughly £285 monthly on utility bills and hope to slash their current £430 monthly food shop to £175 after harvesting their crops.

And Amy, previously a receptionist but now a full-time homesteader, said they couldn't be happier following the July 2022 move.

She said: ""Throughout the pandemic we re-evaluated our lives. We'd paid off our mortgage of our first house and we realised we didn't have as much life satisfaction or job satisfaction.

""We looked in Wales, but prices had gone up and we saw the opportunity to move to Ireland and we just thought, why not? We fell in love with this one. Packed up, quit work and moved over.""

Amy and Peter - a self-employed builder - had always craved more space and growing veg in their previously small garden gave them a desire to move. They lived in London before moving to Lincolnshire.

She said: ""I grew up in London and whenever we left London on a day trip I always wanted to live elsewhere. It gives us peace and opportunities that we've never had.

""We're growing a lot of our food and our children are growing up around animals. I do feel more at peace here and more at home.""

When they need essentials, Amy will nip to the supermarket. But the family has made an active decision to grow as much as they can.

Amy said: ""We've got a veg garden, polytunnels and a greenhouse. We're looking at in excess of 200 tomato plants, 150 pepper plants, potatoes, sunflowers, corn, kale, cabbages, 100 strawberry plants, fruit trees, apples, cherries, plums.

""I just think it'll be nice once we've got guests that we can offer a pick your own fruit and veg when they stay. I'd like to create an off-grid experience.

""We kind of just buy the essentials. We make oat-milk at home and we try to use local butchers for meat, but we don't eat a lot.

""Once we've got a good supply of stuff, I plan to store it, freeze and dehydrate it. I want to bring the shopping bill down. I do plan to get into canning soon too.""

Electricity is the only utility that Amy and Peter pay for, though they say it can be quite strenuous chopping up wood for their heating.

Amy said: ""When they said about the heating and electricity bills going up in the UK I was so worried before we moved, so we've definitely been quite fortunate that we're only paying for electricity now.

""We're paying around £150 a month on electricity and we were paying at least £250 a month before we moved - and that was before the price went up.""

Amy home-schools her four children - Summa, 14, Oliver, 13, Gracie, nine, and Amelie, eight - and said they'd ""never had so much freedom before"".

She added: ""I think they love the space and the freedom they have to go and play. They tend to go and run off with the dog.""

Amy and her family are well on their way to completing their Irish homestead, but the land contains a number of other buildings that they hope to renovate and one day turn into an Airbnb.

She said: ""We've got a two-bed cottage to renovate. The walls need re-doing and the bathroom needs renovating.

Aldi and Tesco both confirmed the move this afternoon and said that a ""temporary"" three-item limit was to be placed on certain food products sold in stores, following similar action by Asda and Morrisons

Aldi and Tesco have followed fellow supermarkets Asda and Morrisons by imposing customer purchase limits on certain salad vegetables.

Budget supermarket Aldi now has a ""temporary"" three-item limit was to be placed on peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes.

Tesco then became the fourth supermarket to announce a buying limit of three per person for customers on tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers.

The UK's largest supermarket chain said the move was a precautionary measure.

It comes after Morrisons announced it was putting limits of two per item on four products, and Asda said on Tuesday it was limiting shoppers to three items across eight products.

Asda said the restrictions were put in place because it was experiencing ""sourcing challenges"" for products that are grown in southern Spain and north Africa.

Industry experts warn the crisis could last until as late as April, with Andrew Opie, Director of Food & Sustainability at the British Retail Consortium trade body, saying the issues were likely to last a ""few weeks"".

Other supermarkets such as Sainsbury's, Waitrose and Lidl told Mirror Money today that they were not planning on introducing buying limits on certain products.

Currently, the products that are being rationed at each supermarket include:

Tesco

Three per person when buying:

Aldi

Three per person when buying:

Asda

Three per person when buying:

Morrisons

Two per person when buying:

There are several reasons for the current supply issues UK supermarkets are experiencing.

Firstly, suppliers in Morocco and Spain, which are two of the UK's biggest suppliers over the winter months, have experienced cold temperatures, heavy rain, and flooding over the past three to four weeks.

This has affected the crops and on top of this, the bad weather has caused several ferries which transport the vegetables to the UK to be halted.

The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said Britain typically imports 95% of its tomatoes and 90% of lettuces from December to March.

Another reason for the reduced supplies has also been down to rising energy costs for British growers.

British farmers are struggling to power their greenhouses which are used to grow specific crops during the colder months.

The British Retail Consortium said shortages were expected to last a few weeks until the UK growing season begins and retailers found alternative suppliers.

A scientist has raised the alarm over a rapidly growing population of highly intelligent 'super pigs' which will 'feed on anything' and could spread deadly diseases to humans

Intelligent hybrid 'super pigs' could pose a threat to humanity, according to a worried scientist.

A cross-breed between wild boar and domestic pigs, they can grow to a staggering 45 stone in size and have been even known to eat smaller animals.

Scientists also fear they could potentially harbour deadly diseases that would cause major problems for mankind.

The now-feral pigs were originally bred to help meet the high demand for boar meat in the 1990s, before being set free in Canada back in 2001 after demand dropped.

But the lack of natural predators in the area has allowed them to wreak havoc on crops, destroying natural environments and water quality.

Since then the pig population has flourished and gained natural immunity to cold weather thanks to their thick fur, with their high levels of intelligence meaning they have earn learned how to dig snow caves to keep warm.

Experts are now concerned over the effect the swine could have on the environment and other species unless serious action is taken.

Dr Ryan Brook, who leads the University of Saskatchewan's Canadian Wild Pig Research Project said: ""Wild hogs feed on anything. They gobble up tons and tons of goslings and ducklings in the spring.

""They can take down a whitetail deer, even an adult. These animals are very well adapted.

""They have an incredibly thick coat of hair and fur and that gives them a massive benefit to survival.""

""A 638lb pig is going to do a lot better out in the cold than an 80lb pig by a long shot.

But the associate professor said it was the threat of disease that ""turns my hair grey"", adding that there's a ""long shopping list of what pigs can get"".

The team's GPS tracking programme has shown the pigs travel very large distances, he said, making their potential to spread outbreaks more serious.

Some have also voiced fears that they may migrate south of the border as their population continues to grow.

Initially from Europe, the pigs were shipped to Canada in the 1980s to diversify the country's agriculture.

Farmers decided to cross-breed them with domestic pigs to help them survive the cold weather, with pigs' regular breeding cycles in comparison to boar also making it a wise business decision.

But some farmers began to let the super pigs roam free in the wild when the boar meat market tailed off in the early 2000s.

Dr Ryan Brook now believes a serious programme of eradication should be considered on existing feral populations. and likened the current situation to stopping a ""cancer or forest fire"".

He claimed once a population of feral pig is established in an area, it could in the environment for at least another 500 years.

Homeowners can say goodbye to the swathes of moss covering their patio and driveway thanks to a simple 70p solution that comes with the backing of gardening experts

Moss can grow just about anywhere, provided there's enough moisture for the plant to survive - meaning it crops up in all sorts of places. But you don't have to put up with the invader.

Whether it's spouting up in your driveway, or snaking its way across your patio, it is possible to remove the unwanted guest from your garden and outdoor spaces.

Tackling the problem often feels like a daunting task, but homeowners can rest reassured, as experts say there's a household staple that makes moss ""very easy to remove"".

Talking to the Express, the pros at Green Acres Landscape recommended using bleach to tackle your driveway.

The gardening gurus claimed: ""Bleach is the best solution to remove moss from the driveway.

""You just need to make sure you use the chemical carefully because it can stain the pavement or kill the surrounding plants.""

To implement their advice, carefully mix approximately 600ml of bleach with 4.5 litres of water. Then use a garden sprayer to apply the bleach, let it sit for 15 minutes, and wash the mixture away using warm water.

Once you've completed these steps, there's only one more to go.

""The moss should die and become yellow in a few hours. At this point, it will be very easy to remove with a broom or brush,"" advise the pros.

Given most of us will have a bottle of bleach in our cleaning supplies, the hack shouldn't prove costly, and if you need to top up, it's available from Tesco for 60p or Asda and Sainsbury's for 70p.

Alternatively, if you would prefer not to use bleach, white vinegar should do the trick. The experts recommend mixing equal parts vinegar with water and spraying as you would with bleach, before washing it off after 15-20 minutes.

""The moss should die within a few hours and you can easily remove it with a scrub.""

While you're at it, you may wish to tackle your lawn. Moss ""doesn't really harm the grass,"" according to the pros, but it can ""inhibit growth."" In such instances, the ""best way"" to eliminate the moss is to rectify conditions by improving soil pH and ensuring the affected area gets plenty of sunlight.

Once you've improved the conditions, use a rake or dethatching blade to remove all of the moss.

Gaseous cattle are blamed for fuelling emissions by belching and breaking wind - but a solution could be at hand as the Government desperately tries to hit net-zero

Farting cows could be given ""methane suppressants"" to stop them breaking wind and fuelling global warming.

Dairy cattle are set to be given ""compound feeds"" containing additives to cut digestive gas, it has emerged.

Ministers intend to force farmers to give their livestock the feed because of the amount of methane cows release into the air when they belch or fart.

In the UK, cows are blamed for about 5% of global carbon emissions created by human activity.

Slashing harmful gases released into the atmosphere are key to the Government meeting its legally-binding pledge for net-zero emissions by 2050.

The Government's net-zero growth plan said officials ""anticipate entry of high efficacy methane suppressing products to the UK market from 2025"" and would explore their use for dairy farms ""at pace"".

Read More

""This will include the ambition to mandate the introduction of products with proven safety and efficacy in compound feeds for cattle as soon as practically possible in England,"" it added.

Launching its original consultation last August, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""Cows and sheep are the main cause of methane emissions from farms.

""Introducing feed products that reduce methane to livestock diets may have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""

National Farmers' Union President Minette Batters welcomed the move.

""Food additives - probiotics - to make sure that cows are emitting less methane is a really good thing and it's already online,"" she told BBC1's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.

David Hughes, 26, has been banned from keeping dogs for five years after his two American XL Bullies attacked and killed 22 pregnant sheep and injured dozens more

Two American XL Bulldogs were shot dead by a farmer in South Wales after they attacked and killed 22 pregnant sheep and injured another 48.

David Hughes, 26, of Pen y Wern, Rhosllanerchrugog, appeared at Wrexham Magistrates Court on Tuesday (August 22), and admitted being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control and being the owner of a dog worrying livestock. Hughes was banned from keeping dogs for five years and ordered to pay £900 in fines. The incident involving the dogs happened on private agricultural land in Rhosllanerchrugog on March 6, after the pets escaped from their home.

Despite several attempts by the farmer to stop the dogs attacking his livestock, he was unable to get them under control, before one became aggressive towards him. Both dogs were eventually shot by the farmer at the scene, with the financial cost of the incident amounting to more than £14,000.

Time for action on Danger Dogs

The Mirror is calling for:

â– 1 The overhaul of the Dangerous Dogs Act. An urgent review of the law is needed and tougher penalties should be considered.

â– 2 Enforce the rules to stop the illegal and irresponsible breeding and selling of dogs.

â– 3 A public information campaign to promote the importance of responsible dog ownership and the need for training.

PC Chris James said: ""I welcome this result after what was a horrific scene for the victim, who is still suffering the effects of the incident today. The emotional and financial impact on the farmer has been considerable. Livestock attacks are extremely distressing not only for the animals, but for their keepers too. The costs, both financially and emotionally for such distressing incidents are wholly unacceptable.

""Responsible dog ownership is key in tackling these awful incidents, which are far too common. It is so important to ensure pets are always kept on a lead and under control around in the countryside - or if left at home alone, that the house or garden are secure. A dog's owner is the only person who can prevent an attack from happening, and you may have to pay the ultimate price if you cannot control your animal. If your dog has escaped in a rural area, you should contact the police as early as possible so local farmers and landowners can be alerted.""

The Mirror is calling for an urgent review of the law and tougher penalties, as well as proper enforcement of rules to stop the illegal and irresponsible breeding and selling of dogs. We also want the Government to launch a public information campaign to promote responsible dog ownership and the need for training.

Helena Worth says aliens are responsible behind the recent killings of two sheep in the Cambrian mountains in Wales, and has been obsessed with UFO spotting since she claimed to have seen one years ago

A UFO hunter has claimed aliens butchered a number of sheep in Wales.

Helena Worth, a self-described ""amateur scientist"", became obsessed with aliens after she claimed to have spotted one flying over her home several years ago.

The 41-year-old who works for Ceredigion County Council has now claimed that extra-terrestrial life is responsible for recent mutilations of sheep close to her home.

The cause of the sheep deaths in the Cambrian mountains, which often sees multiple carcasses spread miles apart, has previously been attributed to big cats.

But Helena claims that UFOs are a more likely explanation.

She said: ""With cattle and sheep mutilations it's always very precise cut marks or something an animal couldn't do.

""And there often aren't any footprints up to the animal, so there is no evidence humans are responsible so maybe it could have come from above.""

For years, farmers in and around the Cambrian Mountains have feared a large cat is responsible for the brutal killings of livestock Cambrian News reported.

Rumours of a large feline lurking in the Ceredigion area emerged as far back as the 1970s when a series of sheep were found eaten.

There have been numerous cases since including the killing of 12 sheep in 1981 in the village of 'Bont' - giving name to the Beast of Bont - and the slaughter of 20 in 2012.

Earlier this year local farmer Jonathan Davies also reported the killing of his sheep to cops.

He said: ""Two of my sheep were skinned ... there was no actual body left. Just the skin.

""It was so tidy - it was like someone had been there with a knife and skinned them.

""I'd never seen anything like that before. Only the head was left.""

Mr Davies claims he was told by Dyfed-Powys Police that a big cat could have been responsible for killing his yearling ewes.

Reports of the latest incident is what has prompted Helena to come forward as she claimed the big cat theory wasn't plausible.

She added: ""A cat would have left it a mess, which is why I and others believe a UFO could be to blame for these sheep mutilations in Wales.""

She claimed that previous sightings of orbs close to the attacks added weight behind her theory.

She added: ""There is something in Wales called the 'sheep mutilation corridor'.

""It is an area down Wales where these have occurred. We think UFOs are responsible as orbs have been seen about the time and in the areas these mutilations have happened, both in Wales and in the US.""

Recalling her first UFO experience in December 2018, Helena, of Ciliau Aeron, said: ""It was six o'clock in the morning and, because it was winter, it was pitch-black outside.

""Then I noticed, at the other side of the valley - which is about three quarters of a mile away - a very bright white, yellow light.

I knew there were houses there and my initial thought was that there was a house on fire.

""I wondered whether I should drive over and find out what was going on or phone the fire brigade.

""And as I was deciding, the bright light started to move. It was circular, like a sphere, and it was hovering until it started to move to the west very slowly but in a straight-line trajectory.

""Then it stopped above some houses, and it was there for a few seconds. I thought I was seeing things but then it started moving back to the east in the same straight line.

""It was moving at between, I would guess, 20 and 30 miles per hour.

""And as it was moving to the east it started dripping - like molten lava was dripping down from it.

""And just before it went out of sight, the craft turned a bright red colour and disappeared behind the trees.""

The life-sized statue was placed outside the Houses of Parliament to highlight the potential of using cow poo as a renewable energy source

Londoners were baffled by a bizarre sight outside the Houses of Parliament -a life-sized cow sculpture with a Victorian-style street lamp emerging from its rump.

The unusual statue, complete with the 19th century sewer lamp replica, was placed in Westminster to highlight how the faeces of on-farm livestock could be used as a renewable energy source.

The UK's largest dairy cooperative, Arla, was behind the cow lamp stunt, in a bid to draw attention to the potential of biogas - which is derived from cow poo and food waste.

Biogas was once a staple of Victorian Britain after Birmingham engineer, Joseph Edmund Webb, patented a sewer gas destructor lamp fuelled by emissions from London's sewers.

And following the government's announcement last month of a major new strategy to deliver energy security and net zero, it has been suggested poo could help solve the UK's energy security crisis, with a nationwide strategy for anaerobic digestion of farm and food waste.

James Pirie, vice president of logistics at Arla, said: ""Dairy farmers have the potential to play a major role in the future of the UK's energy security, using natural resources to provide more energy independence.

""With better infrastructure and network support, Britain's livestock sector has the potential to turn nearly 91 million tonnes of manure and slurry, and 10 million tonnes of food waste, into eight billion cubic metres of biomethane - enough to power 6.4 million homes.

""If we put the right policy changes in place and give our farmers the support they need, we can unlock the potential for even more farms to scale their use of renewable energy sources, and ensure a more secure energy system for the future.""

The process of utilising anaerobic digestion is a bacterial breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen, producing biogas which can be converted into energy.

It has been suggested by the brand that a new national anaerobic digestion strategy, incorporating larger community-based facilities generating biogases, can be fed into the gas grid or used in transport, and small-scale digestors create energy for use on farm.

By doing so, it's also been indicated it could be better and more affordable for grid connections to facilitate an anaerobic digestion revolution - and, at the same time, help more farmers install solar power and other renewables.

A farmer from Arla added: ""Cow slurry has the potential to power communities across the UK and be used as a natural fertiliser to nourish the land we farm.

""Unfortunately, installation of an anaerobic digestor to make this happen is not cheap, and operation and maintenance have to be learnt - but the benefits soon outweigh the obstacles.

""We're hoping that with the Government's help, we can resolve the difficulties farmers face with grid connections, costly installations, and regulatory and planning issues, so we can better utilise this invaluable energy source.""

WARNING: DISTRESSING IMAGES. Villagers in the Amazon sliced open a 20-foot boa constrictor after suspecting it had eaten their livestock and found an entire sheep in its stomach

The horrifying moment an entire sheep was found inside the belly of a python as villagers cut it out, was captured on camera.

Amazonian villagers had to slice open a 20-foot boa constrictor to retrieve the whole sheep.

The footage shows the grisly procedure where one shepherd is standing on the boa's head as another cuts into its belly with a knife.

As the animal is slowly sliced open, the sheep's legs pop out first, quickly followed by the entire animal.

Shockingly, the sheep seemed to be all in one piece and the snake's powerful digestive juices had not yet had time to dissolve it.

The butchery took place near the rural communities of Sitio Boa Vista and Povoado Santo Antonio, on the eastern edge of the Amazonian rainforest in the state of Alagoas, in north-eastern Brazil, on Saturday, 18th March.

The villagers were said to have killed the snake after spotting its swollen belly and suspecting it had eaten one of their livestock.

It can take up to five days for a boa to digest its prey, due to their unique eating style.

Contrary to popular belief, the snakes don't dislocate their jaws, but have the terrifying ability to open their mouths wide enough to swallow prey like the sheep whole.

In particularly morbid cases when humans are swallowed, it can take up to two weeks for snakes to digest them, before excreting only hair and bones.

The Brazilian authorities recommend that when a boa is found, people should not touch it and call the Environmental Police, the Environment Department or the Fire Department.

But over half are unaware this could have a catastrophic impact on livestock if they were to become carriers of tapeworm

More than one in ten dog owners (14%) admit they never pick up their pet's poo - and always leave it behind on the ground, according to research.

Nearly three in ten (28%) say there have been occasions where they have turned a blind eye to their pooch doing their business - and, of these, 36% confess it is a regular occurrence that they don't clean up after their four-legged friend.

The poll of 2,000 dog owners found that 36% are more likely to leave their pet's excrement behind in a rural field.

And even when it comes to those who do clean up after their dog, nearly two-thirds (64%) don't think about what they might still have left behind on the ground, even after binning their poo bags.

As a result, 51% are unaware of the catastrophic impact it can have on livestock, were they to become carriers of tapeworm.

The research was commissioned by the makers of Droncit, a tapeworm tablet brand for dogs that kills off the parasite to avoid illness in canines, livestock, and even humans.

Luke Gamble, CEO of Worldwide Vet Service, a veterinary expert speaking on behalf of the brand, said: ""Tapeworm can be a real issue, and can be passed on to livestock, which in turn costs our farming industry millions of pounds each year.

""This is something, understandably, many would have no idea about, and struggle to see how there's an impact. However, there is no doubting the link between owners not picking up after their pets and transmission to livestock - and even, in some cases, humans.

""The solution to this issue for owners is to ensure your dog is given worming tablets, and at the right frequency to ensure there's no issues encountered outdoors or within the home.""

It also emerged 56% of dog owners only ever think of the human implications of not picking up dog poo - such as someone standing in it - rather than how it could impact things like livestock.

But 19% have come across someone else's pet's poop when out on a walk, while 77% have witnessed another dog walker actively not pick up after their pooch.

The study also found 65% let their dog off the lead on a walk - with a quarter rating the chance of missing their dog doing their business at medium or high.

However, 27% incorrectly believed picking up a poo is enough to solve the issue of spreading tapeworm - unaware that residue left behind can have more than enough parasites to still be problematic.

Two-thirds also believed they, and fellow walkers, need to think more about the implications of not worming their dog.

One in six (15%) give their dog worming tablets either annually, or less often, according to the data via OnePoll - and 21% only take their canine chum to the vets if there's an issue, rather than having an annual check-up.

A spokesman from Droncit added: ""It's fair to assume if you pick up your dog's poo that would be enough - but actually it's not the case, particularly if your pet isn't wormed. Ensuring your pet gets its worming tablets on a regular basis ensures such problems aren't encountered.

""But this isn't just something you want to do to protect livestock - if your dog has a tapeworm issue, this definitely isn't a situation you'd particularly enjoy escalating in the comfort of your own home, so a simple tablet as regularly as your vet recommends, benefits everyone, including your canine.""

In a video, Andrea Jenkyns said it was important the Tories 'honour' their 2019 manifesto commitments as she appeared alongside her two miniature schnauzers

A Tory MP has launched a petition seeking to reverse Rishi Sunak's controversial decision to scrap a flagship animal welfare bill.

Andrea Jenkyns - a junior minister in Liz Truss's short-lived government - said it was important the Tories ""honour"" their 2019 manifesto commitments.

Describing herself as a ""massive animal lover"" - alongside her two miniature schnauzers Gerturde and Godiva - Ms Jenkyns said she was ""disappointed"" by the U-turn.

The Tory MP said: ""I'm very disappointed to hear in the last couple of days the Government is dropping the Animal Welfare Bill.

""I don't want to see this happen, so if you can please sign my petition - I need 100,000 signatures to get this debated in Parliament. After all, animals matter.""

During last summer's Tory leadership campaign Mr Sunak pledged to champion the legislation, with his team saying it ""will bring in some of the world's strongest protection for pets, livestock and kept wild animals"".

They added: ""Rishi looks forward to championing this Bill as it continues to progress through Parliament.""

But last month the Government was accused by campaigners of an ""astonishing betrayal"" after ditching the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill.

The Tories' election manifesto promised to introduce new laws on animal welfare, including banning exports of livestock for slaughter and tackling puppy smuggling.

New powers for police were also proposed to give greater protection to livestock from dangerous dogs while also improving regulations in zoos.

But in a Commons statement in May, Environment Minister Mark Spencer announced the legislation had been scrapped.

Bizarrely, however, he insisted the key measures proposed in the legislation will still be brought forward ""individually"" before the next general election - expected in 2024.

At the time, the RSPCA hit out at the move, saying: ""While politicians dither, animals suffer.""

It added: ""We are frustrated and disappointed that, despite overwhelming public support, the Government has delayed and delayed and has now broken up the Bill, leading to yet more uncertainty and lost time.""

Warning distressing images. Warwickshire Rural Crime Team said it had found ""absolute carnage"" with 30 sheep having been killed in a ""horrific double dog attack"" near Stretton-on-Dunsmore

More than 30 sheep have been killed in what police have called an ""horrific double dog attack"".

Footage issued by police shows what Warwickshire Rural Crime Team called the ""absolute carnage"" officers found when they attended a report of sheep-worrying near Stretton on Dunsmore.

In a new post on social media, they said more than 30 ewes - female sheep - were killed during the night of February 19 after two dogs escaped from a nearby garden. The owner failed to capture the dogs and made no attempt to alert nearby farmers or authorities, police say.

The crime team said in the post: ""On the morning of the 20th Feb, two neighbouring farmers and shepherds were able to catch one of the dogs, stopping it from attacking the rest of the flock. The second dog eventually made its way back home.

""We quickly identified the owner of both dogs and attended the address. A dog control order was immediately issued to the owner to protect both the public and other animals."" Police say it was the farmer's wishes that the matter be formally dealt with through a Community Resolution (out-of-court procedure). As such, the owner agreed to:

The police added that they receive ""multiple"" cases of incidents involving dogs and sheep and told people to keep their dogs on leads. It also said anyone living near livestock should try and ensure that their gardens are secure if they have dogs, CoventryLive reports.

It stated: ""This type of incident causes a significant amount of unnecessary distress to all parties and can be easily avoided. Each year, we regrettably receive multiple reports of dog vs. sheep incidents, but this is by far the worst single attack our team has had to deal with.

""Please, if you walk your dog near livestock, keep them on a lead. If you live in an area where livestock graze, make every effort you can to secure your garden.""

Sandy Thomson's stable lost Hill Sixteen in the Grand National at Aintree. On Saturday he has two runners in the Scottish version at Ayr, Empire Steel and Flower Of Scotland

Sandy Thomson has lost count of the emails, text messages and letters he has received.

The vast majority sympathise over his stable's devastating loss of Grand National runner Hill Sixteen. But others lambast the trainer, who bid a tearful farewell to his horse at the first fence.

In the face of criticism, Thomson has stood firm, putting the blame at the protestors' door. He says Hill Sixteen, a proven Aintree performer, was stirred by their actions to delay the start of Saturday's race. Thomson, who has two runners in today's Coral Scottish National, feels the activists used Aintree to push their agenda for a plant-based food system.

""Social media gives them an instant platform, it was a PR goal targeting the Grand National,"" he said. ""We have had many wonderful messages about Hill Sixteen and then you get the idiots contacting you.

""The staff have found it more difficult, as they don't usually deal with the media. Some of the protestors claim to have been to racing yards - to me it is clear they haven't.""

Thomson, whose grandfather bred dual Grand National runner-up MacMoffatt, feels happiest amongst his horses. He is based near Kelso Racecourse, the venue for a double on the run-up to Cheltenham's flagship National Hunt Festival.

Before turning his hand to training, at stables steeped in history, Thomson took on the titans of rugby with the South of Scotland team. Back on home turf, he saddles Empire Steel and Flower Of Scotland in Ayr's feature race, which has a first prize of £112,540.

""It would give everyone a huge boost if they could run well,"" he said.

""On Tuesday, our work morning, it was just nice to be out with the horses - they've kept us going. We had the double at Kelso and a few weeks later, sadly lost Hill Sixteen. It is a game of ups and downs.""

Empire Steel, who raised Kelso's roof with his late rattle to defy Le Milos 49 days ago, gives plenty of weight to stablemate Flower Of Scotland. The mare carries the colours of leading Scottish owner Raymond Anderson Green, who took the 2010 and 2012 renewals with Merigo.

Thomson says the two horses not only differ in the weight they carry, but in their personalities too.

""Empire Steel is called Squeals at home, he calls for his food in the morning and likes to have it first before the others,"" he said.

""Flower Of Scotland is much more laid back about everything. Ayr is very important to Scottish racing, it gives us a chance to take on the southern boys. It's great to be going there with two horses in with a good chance.""

Former Emmerdale star Kelvin Fletcher opens up on his regrets on moving to the countryside to start a new life as a farmer as he misses the comfort of having his family close by

After playing Emmerdale's Andy Sugden for more than 20 years, actor Kelvin Fletcher decided to ditch urban life and stardom as a soap actor to embark on a new life on a farm - with his family in tow.

The 39 year old soap star decided to take on a 120-acre holding on the edge of the Peak District two years ago to run a farm - and then turn it into a TV show. But now, ahead of the new series of Fletcher's Family Farm, that airs on ITV on October 15, the former actor has revealed that there are a few things he misses about not living in the city.

Kelvin explained: ""I was really happy where we were but there's nothing I miss that I don't have; well except I think the only thing is mum and dad coming around for a brew because they lived five minutes away. The thing I love is days like today, the sounds of the birds and all the noises. It's the stillness, no other place has made me feel quite as present as this place does and that's the ability it has. It is the stand still ability that allows you to capture that moment.""

He added: ""That's so rare for everyone because we are all so busy. Busy lives, busy careers and constantly looking forward, being ambitious and planning. But that is one thing, it offers that solace and I think that is absolutely crucial especially with a young growing family, because these moments will soon be over. The kids are growing up and I know that we will always want to look back and cherish and recapture these moments so it is key that we remain present.""

And his actress wife Liz, who shares four children with the former Emmerdale star added: ""Yes, I think friends and family because we don't live so close to them anymore. They are the people we miss. But we make big efforts to see them, they come and they will have a huge day on the farm. So we do miss them coming around everyday but we do still have days getting everyone together when we can.""

She continued to say: ""It's also the excitement. Everyday it is down to us to create what we do on the farm and what we do with this space and I think that is one of the best things. We get the chance to look around and think 'right, what's next?' 'Where do we go from here?' We can start with one thing and completely change it the next day. Everyday is different, there has not been a single day that has been the same.""

The couple now have 100 sheep, 30 pigs, 10 horses, six chickens, a cat and Ginger the dog. Oh, and four children under the age of seven. Speaking of his excitment ahead of the new series, Kelvin continued: ""It is a brand new series and coming home! Back to ITV. In many respects, this has been a long time in the making and we have been here at the farm for two years now. We have established a home here. The whole purpose of this programme is to give a real and genuine insight into how life on the farm is. We are considered new entrants to farming, so even though it's been our home for two years, we are still very much the newbies in town. We have never done anything like this before.

Newfound farmers Kelvin Fletcher and wife Liz Marsland have been together for 14 years and are happier than ever - but their relationship hasn't always been smooth sailing

Emmerdale star Kelvin Fletcher has swapped fame for farm life after his family made the big decision to take on a 120-acre holding on the edge of the Peak District two years ago. And now, Kelvin, 39, and his actress wife, Liz Marsland, are sharing their drastic lifestyle change with fans on their new series, Fletcher's Family Farm, which airs on ITV on Sunday, October 15.

The couple who have 100 sheep, 30 pigs, 10 horses, six chickens, a cat and Ginger the dog - plus their brood of four all under the age of seven - say it's been a 'rollercoaster ride'. When their show was announced in August, Kelvin and Liz said: ""Navigating farming life with four small kids is certainly a challenge but one full of laughter and unforgettable memories.""

Kelvin and Liz first met when they were eight years old, but officially got together much later in life when they reunited in 2009. Six years later, they tied the knot in a beautiful ceremony at London's One Mayfair. At the time, Kelvin told HELLO! Magazine: ""I knew I wanted to marry Liz the day I met her. Deep down I knew she was 'the one.'""

During their 14-year romance, the couple have the couple have had ups and downs but appear happier than ever now, as they embark on a whole new chapter learning how to run a farm with their young family.

After taking on the world of farming, it's unlikely Kelvin will be met with many keen fans day to day, or have to kiss any of his colleagues - both of which reportedly caused feuds between the couple at the start of their relationship. In 2010, Kelvin was dumped by Liz after he was bombarded with explicit messages and photos from fans.

According to The Sun, a pal explained at the time: ""Liz has always been jealous of the attention Kelvin receives. He is always getting stopped by girls wanting his autograph when he's on nights out. Kelvin assures her nothing goes on but over the years it has worn her down and she decided that she just couldn't continue seeing him."" While they later got back together, Kelvin admitted she found it hard watching him kissing co-stars on Emmerdale.

""I do ring her up and say, 'I'm kissing so-and-so today' and make a joke about it,"" he told the publication. ""That's how we deal with it. But Liz won't watch the show because she gets too jealous. To me, though, it's just work."" He added that he understood why Liz would have 'reservations' about him meeting loved-up fans, but that she had got 'used to it' and it was 'fine'.

BBC star Andrew Hollinshead ploughed his farming vehicle into Dr Paul Uglow after the GP followed him home following a road rage row in Cheshire

An award-winning farmer who appeared on the BBC is facing jail after driving his 7.5-tonne tractor into a GP neighbour's car during a road rage row.

Andrew Hollinshead ploughed his farming vehicle into Dr Paul Uglow after earlier ""cutting him up'' at a junction.

Hollinshead featured on a BBC regional programme after being named Green Farmer of the Year at the Northern Farmer Awards in 2016.

During the astonishing road rage row, Dr Uglow followed 54-year-old Hollinshead back to his farmyard in Cheshire.

The incident occurred on the busy A534 at 6.20pm on July 11 of last year when Dr Uglow who runs a surgery at Haslington medical centre near Crewe was driving home from work, having earlier collected his six-month-old puppy.

Prosecutor Simon Leong said: ""Dr Uglow saw a tractor pull out on the right in front of him causing him to make an emergency stop. The tractor stopped and its driver gave a middle finger salute to Dr Uglow.

""Dr Uglow then made the decision to follow the tractor as he wished to speak to the driver about what happened.

""At the defendant's farm, he rolled down the window, saying ""˜Can I have a word please?'. But the driver of the tractor who was about 50 yards away across the yard went straight in his direction and rammed straight into the driver's side of the vehicle where Dr Uglow was sitting in the driver seat.

""He was applying the accelerator at the time and it caused the car door to bend and the driver's side window to shatter, causing glass to fall on Dr Uglow, who suffered a slight injury to his right arm which was bleeding.

""The defendant then got out of the tractor and said ""˜I will tell the police you pulled out in front of me'. He got back into his tractor and drove away.

Dr Uglow told the hearing: ''I saw Mr Hollinshead's green tractor pulling out of a driveway on the right and I sounded my horn to warn him of my presence. But he continued to come across the road and I had to swerve hard to my left to avoid a collision with him.

""I hit the side embankment very hard, causing damage to the two alloy wheels. By the time I stopped the tractor had completed his manoeuvre and I could see the driver remonstrating, saying what I understood to be obscenities. He was saying ""˜F**k off?', ""˜You are a w*****r', ""˜P**s off.' I read his lips.

""He then started to get out of the cab and was climbing down the steps of the left-hand side of the vehicle. I assumed he was getting out to talk about what happened.

""But he then changed his mind and got back in. There were some more obscenities and hand waving.

""There were some V-signs and he drove off in the same direction as I was heading home. I started to follow the tractor, keeping a safe distance. I could not overtake but I thought he kept putting his brakes on when there was no obvious need to brake and I do not know if he was trying to encourage me to hit his vehicle.""

The doctor said he managed to overtake the tractor and planned to go home and phone the police, but when he saw Hollinshead turn into his farm he realised they were neighbours, so he entered the farm by a second entrance nearer to his home.

""I wanted to go to speak to him to tell him that he damaged my car and say ""˜Let's just exchange details in a civil fashion'. So I went to a different entrance to the farm. I didn't know it was his farm until he went home.

""I could see the driver of the tractor and he was halfway down the steps with his back to me. I'm still in my vehicle with the engine running. The driver sees me and he gets back into the tractor. He drives across the compound. He does not brake or speak to me and goes straight into my driver's door.

""There is no communication. I could not even think about getting out and speaking to him and saying ""˜Let's sort this out'.

""He drove straight into me.

""The tractor hit the front driver's side wheel arch and the driver's door. On the front of the tractor was a box and a couple of spiky things on it. He used that to hit my vehicle.""

The doctor described hearing a crumpling sound of metal as the door and metal structure of the car was bending, and also a strange cracking sound before the side window broke showering him with glass.

""The shards of glass ended up in the footwell around me, "" he said, ""and one piece lacerated my right arm. The cut was four and a half inches long, sufficient to cause bleeding, but would not require sutures.

""He kept pushing against the vehicle for what seemed like a long time. He kept pushing and the crumpling sound went on for quite a little while. He saw me and drove straight into my vehicle at speed before I had any chance to get out.""

The court was played a recording of a 999 call in which Dr Uglow was heard to say that he had been deliberately rammed and had a cut on his arm. After Hollinshead left the scene, he told the operator that he was ""shaking like a leaf"" and that the tractor driver was ""an absolute animal"".

Hollinshead was convicted of criminal damage and assault occasioning actual bodily harm at Crewe Magistrates Court.

He could face up to four years in prison if sentencing is sent to a crown court.

In 2016, Hollinshead made headlines when he was given the illustrious gong for his eco-friendly farming.

The farmer's business is 90% powered by ""eco-friendly"" energy sources - a wind turbine, 200 solar panels and a hydrogen refuelling station which stores excess electricity in batteries and converts it into hydrogen for use as heating fuel and vehicle fuel for his pickup truck.

His home and bed & breakfast business is totally ""˜green-powered'.

""This is going to be the new hydrogen refuelling system for the farm pick-up,"" he told the BBC at the time.

""We have a wind turbine, 200 solar panels on the roof - we store it in the form of hydrogen and in the batteries in these buildings here.""

""It saves me money and it's power security really, I didn't want to be in the hands of all the big companies - we have natural resources here,"" he told the BBC.

Farmers are worried a new super-trade deal with countries including Mexico, Vietnam and Chile could lead to a massive increase in beef and pork imports from abroad

Farmers have raised the alarm that Britain could be flooded with meat from countries with weaker welfare standards under a new trade deal.

Tory ministers are set within days to reach an agreement in principle for the country to join the Trans-Pacific trading bloc, which includes Canada and Mexico.

But the issue of access to the UK beef and pork markets is understood to be one of the key issues still under negotiation.

The National Farmers' Union is demanding reassurance that British farmers and growers' businesses will not be damaged.

Talks with the 11-nation group - whose members also include New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Japan, Chile, Vietnam and Malaysia - have been going on since 2021.

Environment Secretary Therese Coffey is understood to be pushing to limit how much meat can be shipped to the UK under the deal.

Concerns have previously been raised over Canada wanting Britain to get rid of a ban on hormone-treated beef.

There are now fears that lower animal welfare standards in countries in the Trans-Pacific trade bloc could mean members are able to undercut UK farmers.

NFU President Minette Batters said: ""Joining the CPTPP (the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership). could provide some good opportunities to get more fantastic British food on plates overseas, but we are concerned that the cost will be heavily borne by our beef, poultry and pork farmers.

""As we examine the details of any agreement, we will want to see evidence that our negotiators have not opened up our markets to unmanageable volumes of agricultural produce that will damage our farmers and growers' businesses.""

A Government spokesperson said: ""We will not sign a deal that forces the UK to compromise its high food safety, environmental protection and animal welfare standards.

""Joining CPTPP means 99 per cent of UK goods exports could be eligible for tariff-free trade to a market of 500 million customers.""

Ms Coffey was last week branded ""Calamity Coffey"" by her Labour counterpart after an ""outrageous display"" which saw her booed at an NFU conference.

Ms Coffey was criticised after a dismal display at the convention which saw her say egg shortages were not caused by ""market failure"" and telling farmers ""we can't control the weather in Spain"".

Shadow environment secretary Jim McMahon told the Commons: ""Although there might have been differences about the impact and the scale of the impact, there was consensus. And the consensus was that the Environment Secretary had a pretty bad day at the office.

Are you concerned about weaker cheap meat imports?

0+ VOTES SO FAR

""Some describe it as a slow motion tractor crash; 'Calamity Coffey'. But either way and joking aside, it was an insult to the very foundation of our food security and hardworking British farmers.""

He added: ""Will the Environment Secretary, not the farming minister, use this opportunity to apologise for the outrageous display at the NFU conference in Birmingham yesterday?""

Environment minister Mark Spencer stepped in, telling Mr McMahon that Ms Coffey couldn't answer due to parliamentary procedure.

He added there had been ""robust exchanges"" with NFU members, adding that ministers would ""continue to work with the NFU"" and other groups who represent farmers.

Macauley Owen, 26, Carreglfen, Anglesey, died after suffering serious injuries while working on a farm and now his family have paid tribute to him with his dad describing his ""love for machinery""

A heartbroken family has paid tribute to a ""fun"" man with a ""huge passion and love for machinery"" who tragically died in a farming accident in Anglesey, Wales.

Macauley Owen, 26, suffered serious injuries while working on a farm in Carreglfen, Amlwch on Tuesday, January 3.

Now his family have paid tribute to him as a ""happy-go-lucky"" young man, reported NorthWalesLive.

Macauley was taken to the Royal Stoke University Hospital for treatment that night but sadly he did not recover from his injuries and passed away at the hospital on Friday, January 6.

His devastated family have spoken about the impact his death has had on them, with dad Wil having said: ""I am absolutely devastated and broken by Macauley's death. He was not only my son but my best friend and work partner.

""He was a fun, happy go lucky young man with a huge passion and love for machinery since a really young age, and I will miss him more than words can describe.

""I would like to thank everybody who did what they could to help in trying to save Macauley, the members of the public, the attending paramedics and the doctors and nurses at Ysbyty Gwynedd Bangor hospital and Royal Stoke University hospital.

""I am still continuing to process these events so would kindly ask for privacy during this difficult time.""

Mr Owen's mother Carys added: ""Words can't express the sorrow I feel from the loss of Macauley, the longing, the sadness that will never heal and what I would do to hold him in my arms again.

""I am so proud of all his achievements and the man he became. I am proud to be his mum. Shine them tractor lights bright my boy.

""I would like to thank everyone for their kind tributes. I would also like to thank the paramedics and staff at both Bangor and Stoke hospitals, for the care and compassion they have all shown towards Macauley and our family.""

Macauley's sister Lucy said: ""My heart is broken, my baby brother I will often think of you and be proud of the man that you have become, I will remember your smile and your naughty contagious laugh. Thank you for your kindness, I love you bro.""

His 'nain' Peggy added: ""My Macauley, the only thing I can think of to ease the pain of losing you is that God wanted you up there as one of his angels to be a tractor driver. Goodnight Macauley, until I see you again soon.""

North Wales Police are continuing to investigate the circumstances together with the Health and Safety Executive, and are liaising with the local coroner's office.

Following the death of Hannah Brown, her friends and family now want everyone to know that sepsis can be deadly after their lives were turned ""upside down overnight""

The family of a young farmer want to raise awareness of the devastation caused by sepsis after her fiancÃ© only discovered how serious it was as she lay dying.

Hannah Brown, from Newton-le-Willows, North Yorkshire, died just two days after developing blood poisoning.

Sepsis is the immune system's overreaction to an infection or injury - and it took the life of the 26-year-old, YorkshireLive report.

If not treated immediately, sepsis can result in organ failure and death. However, with early diagnosis, it can be treated with antibiotics.

Their interview comes days after Bafta award-winning actor Jason Watkins relived the night his two-year-old daughter died from the killer bug.

Hannah's boyfriend Ben Richardson only found out how deadly it was when he Googled the condition after she went into hospital in 2021.

Hannah worked as a farmer in Dufton, near Appleby, Cumbria with her fiancÃ© and they have a baby daughter named Millie.

Ben said: ""She was the most caring, hard working person you would ever met. Everything just turned upside down overnight, it was horrible.

""It didn't just turn mine and Millie's lives upside down it changed everyone's because everyone had to adapt. When Hannah was in hospital I Googled it [sepsis] and realised how serious it was.""

Ben said Hannah was an ""amazing"" mum to their daughter.

Hannah's friend Di Harrison said: ""It's so easy to get a little cut or something on yourself in farming. And obviously if it can happen to a fit, young lady like Hannah, it can happen to anyone.""

Her sudden death from sepsis left the farming community across the north in shock, prompting family and friends to join forces with the UK Sepsis Trust to launch a campaign raising awareness of the symptoms and treatment of sepsis.

The campaign led to the making of a documentary which interviewed fiancÃ© Ben, Hannah's parents Martin and Val, spoke to friends at Westmorland County Show and captured how the farming community came together at her funeral, in Dufton. The film has now won an award.

On Tuesday, March 21, two years to the day after Hannah was admitted to hospital, Ben, Val and mother-in-law Dorne attended the Charity Film Awards at the ODEON Luxe, in Leicester Square, to see her story win a special People's Choice prize. Ark Media CEO Phil Arkinstall said it has been a ""privilege"" to pick up the award on behalf of all those who had campaigned in Hannah's memory.

He said: ""It was an emotional night at the awards, not least because the film picked up a People's Choice award - having been chosen by public vote - which illustrated how Hannah's story had impacted on so many.

""We were approached by the UK Sepsis Trust back in August last year about creating something that captured how well-known and loved Hannah had been within the farming community, while also highlighted the shock caused by her sudden loss, and the importance of spreading awareness of sepsis.""

Phil added: ""We filmed it over two days last September, visiting places like the local Young Farmers Club, in Masham, who had been raising funds for UK Sepsis following her death, and found that everyone we talked to simply wanted to help spread the word about sepsis, and to talk fondly about Hannah. We are very proud of the film, and it was a real privilege to collect the award on behalf of everyone who campaigned in her memory.""

Brian Davies, Fundraising Manager at UK Sepsis Trust, who collected the award with Phil, said: ""The UK Sepsis Trust were delighted to win the prestigious People's Choice Award at the Charity Film Awards for our farming campaign video that looks to explain the dangers and symptoms of sepsis, through the story of Hannah Brown.

""It was fitting to have some of Hannah's family collect the award and is also fantastic recognition for the excellent job that Ark Media did in shooting and editing the film.

""The video has enabled the campaign to be featured on Global Radio, and both BBC and ITV regional news shows in the North of England.

""It also allowed the UK Sepsis Trust to seek financial support from NFU Mutual, which will allow for more resources to be developed to help show the agricultural community the dangers of sepsis that they need to consider, whilst going about their daily lives.""

The Bulled family have been farming sheep and dairy at their farm for many generations, but Adrianne has only been involved with the animals since marrying Simon 12 years ago

A farmer has revealed her shock at the birth of 'one in a million' quintuplet lambs.

The Bulled family have been farming sheep and dairy at their West Buckland farm, Buckingham's Leary, for many generations, but Adrianne has only been involved with the animals since marrying 12 twelve years ago.

They are helped by daughters Jorja, Tayla and Daisy.

Adrianne said: ""I'm a townie turned farmer. We married 12 years ago, but I only got involved since our youngest started school. I've only been doing lambing for four years, still quite new to it all, and having quintuplets has come as a complete shock.""

The quintuplets were born on Saturday, March 25, with four boys and one girl.

The family hopes to keep the girl on the farm to keep the original generation going. She will be joining the 70 other sheep on the farm.

Adrianne added: ""We started with four sheep around nine years ago. The mother came from one of those, and she usually has triplets or quads every year.

'This year she started lambing, and it was a tangle in there with lots of legs, and we kept going until we got to five. I've been told it's meant to be something like one in a million, although I haven't looked into it properly. A friend Googled it and found that; whether that's true or not, I don't know.

""I put it on a Facebook group, Ladies that Lamb, and one of the jokes on there was because there's four black ones and one white one, is that the inkjet ran out of ink. The group were shocked as well. I think there have only been two photos of quintuplets shared there.

""It did come as a shock, though. I thought to myself at the time, ""˜oh dear' because at the time we had all the sheep in, we hadn't put any out due to the bad weather, and I didn't know where I was going to put her and where we were going to find the room for five lambs and a sheep.

""It's a bit like being a mother again for me; back to midnight feeds as their mother has only got two boobs, so she can only take two. That means we've got three of them that we have to come in and top up with a bottle at 7pm, midnight, 4am, and noon. It's pretty tiring.

""I've told friends in the farming community, and they have been wowed and asked what we would do with them. We find a lot of people who want to come and see them,"" she told DevonLive.

Her husband Simon has been a farmer all his life, with their farm going back many generations.

He said: ""I've never seen this before, and I don't think my father, who had the farm before us, had seen this sort of thing either.

""My dad, Christopher, is the boss and father of the farm, and he got me and my brother involved, and my dad was the second generation. Now I've got my three girls helping out, and they have been getting up, helping, and doing the night checks as well.""

Tayla said: ""It's pretty tiring having to get up in the night and do it, but it's all fun.""

Jorja added: ""I have to take pictures all the time and send them to friends at school as they all want to see the lambs. They all want to come up and see them all the time.""

Adrianne explained it was good for their children to grow up on a farm. ""It's a good experience, and it's lovely for the kids,"" she said. ""They get to grow up with all of this, not Nintendo and Xbox.""

121,"Mystery illness killing pet dogs identified as 'funky bacterium' - signs to spot","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/mystery-illness-killing-pet-dogs-31512320","Mystery illness killing pet dogs identified as 'funky bacterium' - signs to spot

Dogs across the US are falling ill and dying from a mystery disease that vets couldn't identify or treat - until now.

Researchers think they've found the cause of this respiratory illness, which has killed many dogs nationwide. ""A funky bacterium"" is to blame, according to Dr. David Needle, pathology section chief at the College of Life Sciences and Agriculture at the University of New Hampshire.

The research team is sharing these results before publishing a research article, hoping their initial findings will help vets dealing with this and other respiratory illnesses. This bacterium is smaller than usual in size and genome, which might let it dodge a dog's immune defences in the upper respiratory tract and reach the lungs.

""Long story short, it's a weird bacterium that can be tough to find and sequence,"" added Dr. Needle. He explained that the newly discovered bacteria are new as potential disease causes but likely evolved from a component of the dog microbiome.

Mystery 'funky bacterium' dog illness symptoms

According to the Oregon Department of Agriculture, symptoms of dog respiratory illness include:

The disease can progress to pneumonia, which also doesn't respond to antibiotics. In severe cases, dogs may develop acute pneumonia and could die within a day or two.

However, most dogs survive but remain ill for several weeks, potentially infecting other dogs. Doxycycline might help treat the disease.

Experts are unsure if the same germ is causing the illness nationwide. The symptoms resemble other dog diseases like kennel cough or influenza, making it hard to estimate the disease's spread. It's also unclear if certain breeds are more at risk.

List of states most affected by dog respiratory illness

Veterinarians agree that this mystery disease has been reported in various US states including:

It hasn't been seen in Canada yet. Further research is needed to determine how to treat dogs with this new 'funky bacterium' respiratory illness.

The research process for vets

Needle and his colleagues haven't yet found a way to grow the new bacteria in the lab. But the structure of the bacterium offers some clues about which drugs might be the best choice to fight it, Needle suggested, adding that the antibiotic doxycycline may be effective.

There have been no reports of humans or other animals getting sick from the illness, as the disease seems to be found only in dogs. However, if the bacteria continues to evolve, it might have the ability to jump to people or other animals.

How to avoid the mystery dog illness

It may be hard to avoid during holiday travel but experts recommend dog owners keep their pets out of communal dog bowls, boarding kennels, groomers, dog parks, and other areas where an infection is more likely to spread due to crowded conditions and close contact.

""When you congregate a bunch of animals together, there's a larger likelihood of getting an infectious disease from other dogs,"" Dr. Kurt Williams, director of the Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Lab at the Carlson College of Veterinary Medicine at Oregon State University, told NBC News.

Other holiday options include having a dog sitter or dog walker come to your house to feed and exercise a dog, thus avoiding large groups of dogs. Dog owners are urged to keep their pets' vaccinations, including canine influenza, up-to-date. If your dog starts coughing or showing other signs of illness, it's important to get them checked by a vet straight away.

""I've been telling people to work closely with their vet,"" Williams said. ""And to make sure their dog has all the vaccines available, in particular, those for respiratory diseases we are familiar with.""

Alan Titchmarsh has made a name for himself as a professional gardener and broadcaster, but for some of his fans he's also become a 'sex symbol' and has a little-known raunchy side hustle

When you think of Alan Titchmarsh, you likely think of his gardening programmes Ground Force, The Alan Titchmarsh Show, or Love Your Garden.

But that's not all the 76-year-old green-fingered expert is good at.

The green-fingered expert became a pro with plants after studying at the Hertfordshire College of Agriculture and Horticulture. He then moved on to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew to study for a Diploma in Horticulture and after graduating he remained at Kew as a supervisor before pursuing a career in gardening journalism.

However, he soon found himself in the world of publishing after getting a job as an assistant editor of gardening books, and went on to publish his own tome in 1976.

But you might not know that gardening books aren't the only ones the presenter has under his belt - he also has a rather interesting side hustle writing racy novels.

In addition to gardening how-to guides, biographies, and National Geographic books, Titchmarsh is also the best-selling author of several raunchy fiction novels that fans of Jilly Cooper would love. These include titles such as The Scarlet Nightingale, Animal Instincts, and Love and Dr Devon.

Titchmarsh has written numerous sex scenes in his books but claims they've gotten progressively less racy over the years, which might be for the best as his first novel, Mr MacGregor was in the running for the Literary Review's Bad Sex in Fiction Award in 1998 - and he felt awkward reading the love scenes aloud for the audiobooks.

He previously told the Mirror: ""My first book was a bit of a romp, but when you come to record the audiobook - that's when you get your comeuppance.

""When you've got to sit in a room on your own, with a sheet of glass between you and a very large, bearded man twiddling knobs, and say the words.""

Speaking to The Mirror in 2015, he added: ""I do laugh when my novels are classed as racy because they've got progressively less racy - I've written nine to date, and if people read them now they might be disappointed they aren't racy enough! I don't write anything shocking.

""I'm a man of the world, and most people have all kinds of feelings and sensibilities and I express them.""

But what do his children make of his works of fiction? Thankfully he claims his daughters, Polly, 41, and Camilla, 39, haven't read them.

""That's a lot to ask, reading a love story written by your father. They're like all children, they can't believe their parents actually do anything,"" he admits.

But while his daughters may not be fans for obvious reasons, it seems Alan has garnered a very supportive fan base, leaving many ladies feeling hot under the collar - so much so that there were reports a few years ago that his Madame Tussauds waxwork was attracting a lot of female attention and being ""fondled"".

And while Alan was ""chuffed"" by the Max Factor marks on his waxwork, his wife of 48 years was said to be in disbelief over his newfound 'sex symbol' status.

""I'm chuffed to bits I had a waxwork that was kissed a lot,"" he told The Mirror. ""But it raised eyebrows from the children and wife. When we heard about it, Alison thought they must have been talking about someone else.""

But one woman who had no trouble recognising his charm was the late Queen Elizabeth II, who when awarding him an MBE in 2000, said: ""You give a lot of ladies a lot of pleasure.""

While it's fair to say he has become a heartthrob among a generation, Titchmarsh has previously been forced to deny that he's an actual sex guru.

This came after a prankster updated his Wikipedia page with some false claims, including that Alan had written his own version of the Karma Sutra and that he was a trustee of a charity called Gardens for Squats.

""I wish I knew how to change Wikipedia,"" he said of the prank back in 2009.

In addition to his hordes of adoring fans, he's also garnered appreciation from the rich and famous, with celebs clamouring for his advice.

""Elton John once asked me about his maidenhair fern,"" he said. ""Funnily enough, I went to see him last year (2014) for Britain's Best Back Garden - he has the most amazing garden in Windsor, very tasteful, classy - and he came out and said, 'It's a great honour that you've come.'""

But when life is getting a bit too extraordinary, it's the TV star's family that keeps him grounded. He has shared how his wife Alison is ""the most un-materialistic person"" he knows and he claims the secret to his long-term relationship is being ""thoughtful"".

""Romance is about being thoughtful,"" he said in a previous interview. ""I have made Alison tea for more than 45 years - but mind you, she's ironed my shirts every week for years, which is the greater gift.""

He also enjoys the simple pleasures of spending time with his grandchildren - playing with them in the garden or sitting down together to tuck into a Sunday roast.

Away from all this, Alan has previously shared his health struggles, admitting that all his years of gardening have also had an impact on his body, leaving him with ""blackened fingernails, lacerated arms, and legs from confrontations with well-armed rose bushes, stabbing pains in the back from carrying paving slabs and large posts.""

And in 2020 he also revealed that he takes pills to lower his cholesterol levels in order to ward off his family history of heart disease.

He has been open about how his father and other male relatives have died of heart disease, saying: ""I'm on statins. I wish I wasn't. I don't like the thought of taking tablets every day, but I'm following my doctor's advice. He thinks it's a good idea.

""The thing is, the men in my family have had a tendency to die from heart disease at a relatively young age. My dad, for instance, died suddenly in 1986 from a heart attack, aged just 62.

""Outliving my dad has made me think about things. The truth of the matter is that I've decided to ease up a bit, and pace myself.""

Aragawa has just opened a branch in Mayfair, London - and it'll be tough to digest the bill after your meal with the cheapest steak on the menu starting at £500

A trendy new restaurant now has Britain's most expensive steak on its menu - setting diners back a hard-to-swallow £900 each.

The incredible 14oz sirloin cut from the Tajima strain of black wagyu cattle has gone on sale at posh Mayfair eatery Aragawa. Doors opened last weekend but if you're planning on taking a trip, best check out the prices before ordering.

The rare meat is aged for around a month while shipped in from Japan but bosses defended the price, say it's good value and customers won't feel short changed. Their steak is sourced from farms which are home to fewer than 1,000 animals and prices in the restaurant start from £500.

Tajima beef undergos rigorous certification by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries before making its way onto forks. The kitchen will be overseen by so-called ""steak master"" Kazuo Imayosh and the owners are sure it will be a high-end hit.

""We are not overpricing it - You won't find anything like this anywhere in the world. I feel confident to say you won't find a steak like this in London or in fact anywhere else,"" founder Kotaro Ogawa told the Evening Standard as it threw open its doors on Friday night.

Those who went to try the steak in the Tokyo branch offered mixed reviews online. One wrote: ""We can't recall any stunning dishes"" while others called the food ""perfection for a price"" and another hailed their visit as ""a bucket-list experience"".

The opening came days after Harrods came under fire after leaving customers aghast by a £28 steak sandwich at the Knightsbridge store. The takeaway offering is filled with luxury ingredients - Wagyu beef, one of the world's priciest meats that is imported from Japan, as well as porcini and truffle butter, gold mustard mayonnaise and mushrooms, rocket and braised onions.

Wagyu can cost as much as £160 per pound, while truffle is one of the most expensive ingredients going, costing between 65p and £1 for a single gram. But a roast beef and horseradish mayo sarnie from Marks & Spencer costs just £4, with punters able to buy seven for the same price as the Harrods snack.

Also available for the same price are Wagyu Katso 'Sandos' - Japanese for sandwich - measuring a tiny four by three inches. These contain tiny pieces of deep-fried Wagyu ribeye with mushroom ketchup, BBQ sauce and shredded white cabbage between two slices of bread.

On social media, food fans raised eyebrows over the £28 lunch offering. One, writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, said: ""Just saw someone on TikTok buy and review a sandwich from Harrods that was £28. TWENTY. EIGHT. BRITISH. POUNDS.""

An area of Los Angeles County in California has been put under quarantine restrictions after a tiny invasive fruit fly species from Asia was discovered.

The area, which covers 79 square miles, was placed under quarantine restrictions after more than 20 of the Tau fruit flies, Zeugodacus tau group, were found in the area of Stevenson Ranch, near the city of Santa Clarita.

According to the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) this is ""the first Tau fruit fly quarantine ever in the Western Hemisphere"". The Tau fruit fly is native to Asia and described by the CDFA as a ""serious pest for agriculture and natural resources"".

The fly has a ""wide host range"" which includes numerous fruits and vegetables, along with a select range of plants native to California. The CDFA believes the fly was ""introduced by travellers bringing uninspected produce into the state"" - which they say is a ""common pathway"" for invasive species.

The quarantine area stretches from Castaic Junction on the north, to Oat Mountain on the south, Del Valle on the west and Honby Ave on the east. Residents living in this area are being told they are not allowed to ""move any fruits and vegetables from their property"".

Residents can consume and process fruits and vegetables at the property where they were picked, however, they cannot be moved beyond that location. When it comes to disposing of the produce, residents have been told they can do so by ""double-bagging"" in plastic and putting the bags into a rubbish bin.

The strict quarantine measures have been put in place due to the huge amount of damage the minuscule insects can cause. Adults Tau flies are around 7mm in length, similar to that of a housefly.

They have yellow bodies with black markings, and clear wings with two dark stripes. Females lay their eggs under the skin of host fruit, with a single female laying more than 400 eggs in her lifetime.

Eggs typically hatch in one or two days, with larva tunnelling through the fruit, feeding on the pulp and emerging through their exit holes. They then drop from the fruit, burrowing into the soil where they pupate. Around a week later, adults emerge and take around 12 days to sexually mature before going on to lay more eggs.

The short life cycle means breeding is pretty much continuous for the species, with several generations produced per year. It means that as the population of the Tau fly grows, it has the potential to cause devastating consequences for agriculture in California.

One of the most threatening aspects of the tiny bugs is the broad range of fruits and vegetables which play host to the insect and its larvae. According to the CDFA, there have been ""at least 34 hosts in nine plant families"" reported.

This includes melon, okra, peppers, papayas, citrus, cucumber, pumpkin, avocado, tomato, and gourds. As larvae tunnel through and attack the fruit or vegetable, it may then be ""unfit for consumption"" due to the damage and as a result of decay-producing organisms that can then enter, causing the interior of the fruit or vegetable to rot.

125,"North Korea opens new luxury dog meat restaurant in 'healthy eating drive'","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/north-korea-opens-new-luxury-29350573","North Korea opens new luxury dog meat restaurant in 'healthy eating drive'

Kim Jong-un has reportedly given his backing for a new luxury dog meat restaurant in an exclusive area of Pyongyang, which is believed to be a drive for ""healthier eating"" in North Korea

A luxury dog meat restaurant is being built in an exclusive area of the North Korean capital after being approved by Kim Jong-un who is pushing ""healthier eating"", it is reported.

Occupying a prime river bank location, the ""˜Dog Meat Delicacy House' will be near the well-known Okryugwan noodle restaurant in Pyonyang.

It is believed that the opening of the restaurant and others similar that offer dog meat as a delicacy is part of a drive by the state to improve people's diets.

But it comes as Kim opened a major political conference dedicated to agriculture this week with claims that the country is facing a famine.

South Korean experts estimate that North Korea is short around one million tonnes of grain, 20% of its annual demand, after the pandemic disrupted both farming and imports from China.

Recent unconfirmed reports say that North Koreans have been dying of hunger.

Most analysts say North Korea's food situation today is nowhere near the extremes of the 1990s, when hundreds of thousands of people died in a famine but some say its food problems are at their worst since Kim took power in 2011, after Covid restrictions further shocked an economy battered by decades of mismanagement and crippling US-led sanctions imposed over Kim's nuclear programme.

But while many appear to be facing food shortages, Rossiyskaya Gazeta is reporting the new high-end dog meat restaurant and published a photo of the building design.

It depicts a traditional North Korean building on stilts above the water.

The new restaurant would mean an important use of public funds and it is likely that Kim would visit it as he has done with other eateries in the area.

He used the Okryugwan noodle house and Taedonggang seafood restaurant, in September, 2018, to entertain the South Korean President Moon Jae-in, reported NK News.

He also approved the building of the new dog meat restaurant when speaking on state television in 2021.

And Kim talked of ""improving"" people's diets when he discussed the building of another dog meat restaurant in the northeastern city of Chongjin, that was completed a couple of years ago.

Dog meat is considered a national dish in North Korea with many restaurants existing while cooking contests take place that use all parts of the animal, and can be shown on state television.

A man in his 40s has been crushed to death at a distribution centre in South Korea where a robot appears to have mistaken him for a box of vegetables on a conveyor belt

A worker has been crushed to death by a robot that mistook him for a box of vegetables on a conveyor belt.

The man in his 40s was checking the machine's sensors at a distribution centre for agricultural produce in South Gyeongsang, South Korea, when the tragedy happened. The robot's job was to lift up boxes of peppers onto a pallet but it grabbed the victim by mistake and pressed him against the conveyor belt causing his face and chest to be crushed.

The man was rushed to hospital after the accident last Tuesday but later died. A police investigation was launched and a source said that it appears the robot malfunctioned and identified the man as a box. The probe will look into the safety procedures in place at the distribution centre and see if there is a case for negligence by managers, reported Yonhap news agency.

An official from the Donggoseong Export Agricultural Complex, which owns the plant, called for improved safety systems following the tragic accident. Local media states that tests were due to have been made on the robot on November 6 but they were postponed for two days as problems with the sensors needed to be sorted out first.

And it is not the first time an accident involving a robot has taken place in South Korea. Last March, a man in his 50s suffered serious injuries after getting trapped by a robot at vehicle manufacturing plant. Elsewhere, a robot, partaking in a chess tournament in Russia last year, grabbed and broke the finger of a seven-year-old boy, after he moved more quickly than the bot expected.

According to Russian media sources, the incident happened during a match at the Moscow Open. President of the Moscow Chess Federation, Sergey Lazarev, told the TASS news agency after the tournament that the robot had broken the boy's finger.

The machine had played many previous exhibitions without upset, Mr Lazarev said. Footage of the incident on July 19, 2022, published by the Baza Telegram channel, showed the boy's finger being pinched by the robotic arm for several seconds, with the child looking visibly uncomfortable. A woman, followed by three men, then rush in, freeing the boy from the robot's grip.

Vegan activists are calling upon Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to stick to a plant-based diet for one month, in return offering him £1 million to donate to a charity of his choosing

This January, many of us will be trying out 'Veganuary', giving up all meat and dairy products in favour of a completely plant-based diet. Now vegan activists are calling upon Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to follow suit, offering him £1 million to donate to a charity of his choice if he agrees to go vegan for one month.

In an open letter penned to the PM, vegan organisation GenV stated that ""a plant-based diet is one of the best things we can do to champion British farmers and our countryside"". They also went on to emphasise how plant-based eating could help the country meet emission reduction commitments, while 'supporting public health'.

In the letter, GenV CEO Naomi Hallum wrote: ""William Blake famously wrote of England's green and pleasant land. However, according to the researchers at the Natural History Museum, the UK is one of the world's most nature-depleted countries, going so far as to say that due to the expansion of agriculture, ""˜the UK has led the world in degrading the natural environment'.""

She went on to express her hopes that Sunak would consider 'their sincere offer and lead the UK towards a more sustainable and promising future', adding that she looked forward to hearing his response by January 31.

Speaking with vegan publication Plant Based News (PBN), Hallum said: ""It's important that we hold our leaders responsible for delivering the better future they continuously promise us. The UK Prime Minister has regularly spoken about the importance of showing compassion, and of safeguarding our planet for future generations.

""He already abstains from eating beef, so all we're asking of him is to extend his circle of compassion to other animals and to take the necessary steps towards protecting the planet for our children and grandchildren.""

Back in October 2021, Sunak stated 'I'm not telling anyone to eat less meat' during an interview about carbon emissions with Sky News' Kay Burley, filmed at a meat market in Bury, Lancashire. After Burley quizzed him about the optics of the setting, Sunak argued that there were there 'lots of different ways' to fight climate change.

On January 3, PBN reported that Sunak had yet to respond to the letter.

WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES - Pest controller Gareth Davies said some rats in Wales are now the size of small cats, and the new ban will only make the problem of vermin worse

A ban on the use of glue traps in Wales will allow ""cat-sized"" rats to run free in the streets, a pest controller has claimed.

Wales has become the first nation in the UK to ban snares and glue traps to catch animals. The measure was included in the first Agriculture Act and the ban on snares is a Programme for Government commitment.

When announcing the ban, the Welsh Government said that snares - also called cable restraints - cause suffering to animals, and are indiscriminate as they can harm species they are not intended for such as otters, dogs and cats. An animal caught in a snare can endure acute pain and suffering.

Similarly, glue traps cause suffering to the trapped animal, including the rodent it was intended for and other animals such as cats, reports Wales Online. If pets such as cats are caught in a glue trap it can tragically lead to the animal being put to sleep as a result of the injuries sustained.

But a pest controller said the ban on glue traps will make it harder to control rats in cities. While acknowledging that the sticky traps were ""barbaric"", Gareth Davies said the problem of vermin in cities has never been so bad, explaining that some rats are now ""the size of a small cat"" - and these kind of traps are often used as a last resort.

He told BBC Wales: ""I was in a city centre restaurant on Tuesday and got called in by a customer... I located this rat wedged up inside between an oven and a fryer, and it was huge. It's the biggest rat I've seen."" He agreed that the traps were ""barbaric"" but said they were only used a a last resort and would force pest controllers to do their work with one hand tied behind their back, causing a ""catastrophic"" problem for town and city centres.

Mr Davies claimed rats were able to avoid other methods of capture, saying that on one occasion the vermin avoided traps and poison for weeks before he put down sticky boards ""and I went back at 6am and I caught 15"". The Welsh Government say that alternative methods of predator control are widely available, and similarly while rodent control is essential where prevention has failed, more humane and targeted methods are available.

Rural affairs minister Lesley Griffiths said: ""This is a historic day for animal welfare. We strive for the very highest standards of animal welfare in Wales, and the use of snares and glue traps are incompatible with what we want to achieve.

""Many animals will now be spared the most terrible suffering as a result of this ban. I'm proud Wales is the first of the UK nations to introduce such a move. The banning of snares and glue traps is not about preventing predator or rodent control. There are other more humane ways to do this. I'd like to thank all our partners who've worked hard to bring this ban about, and I look forward to continuing to ensure we have the very highest standards of animal welfare in Wales.""

Billie-Jade Thomas, senior public affairs manager at RSPCA Cymru said: ""We very much welcome the ban on snares and glue traps coming into force today. Both have the potential to cause immeasurable suffering to animals. Too often, our officers have dealt with animals in severe pain and misery at the hands of these devices; which are cruel, indiscriminate and totally unnecessary. The lives of many animals will be saved including wildlife, pets and farm animals such as sheep and lambs.""

It's the first time mammals have been confirmed as having bird flu in Northern Ireland - the public is being urged to follow specific safety advice including keeping pets away from carcasses

Positive cases of bird flu have been found in two fox cubs, as well as in wild birds in Portrush, Co Antrim.

The Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) has confirmed the positive results for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or bird flu.

It is the first time mammals have been confirmed as having bird flu in Northern Ireland. There have been positive cases of HPAI in mammals over recent months across Europe, Great Britain, and the Republic of Ireland.

The most recent findings from Portrush were detected as part of DAERA's routine disease surveillance, and the laboratory has confirmed the strain of the disease as H5N1 in both the fox cubs and wild birds.

DAERA is encouraging the public to keep their dogs on leads and keep pets away from carcasses, particularly in coastal areas. The public is also being urged to report any findings of dead wild birds through the new online reporting form on the DAERA website.

The Public Health Agency (PHA) has said that human infections with avian flu are rare as it is primarily a disease of birds - with the risk to the health of the general public being very low.

The PHA has released a number of guidelines in containing the spread of HPAI. The public is advised not to pick up or touch sick, dying or dead poultry, wild birds or wild animals and keep pets away from them, avoid contact with surfaces contaminated with bird faeces, avoid untreated bird feathers (such as those found in the environment) and other bird waste.

People are also advised to maintain good personal hygiene, with regular hand washing with soap and use of alcohol-based hand rubs. The Food Standards Agency has also said there is a very low risk to public health from the consumption of properly cooked poultry meat or eggs provided appropriate hygiene measures are followed.

Researchers looked at how specific causes of air pollution are linked to dementia, following a decades-long survey where they regularly checked in with adults about their health

New research has estimated hundreds of thousands of cases of dementia in the US may be caused due to the air we are breathing in.

As we live longer, more and more countries are battling with growing rates of dementia. Almost 188,000 dementia cases in the US each year are thought to be caused by air pollution, with poor air quality due to wildfires and agriculture showing the strongest association with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia later in life.

The research, published Monday, August 14, in the journal JAMA Network Open, contains new estimates which are the latest to underscore a range of health risks long warned to be linked to air pollution.

Studies have already linked poor air quality to a number of health problems, including the risk of developing dementia. However, the new study took a closer look at how specific causes of air pollution seem to be more strongly linked to dementia than others.

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.

Findings were based on analysis of data collected from a decades-long survey, backed by the National Institutes of Health. Thousands of older adults were checked in with regularly every two years about their health.

Researchers then combined that data with detailed air quality modelling, estimating what people may have been exposed to in the areas where they lived. The focus was on what scientists call PM 2.5 air pollution which is a benchmark for very small particles - less than 2.5 micrometres wide, a fraction of the diameter of human hair - that can be inhaled from the air.

These particles can come from a variety of sources, including vehicle exhausts and wildfire smoke. They are linked to health effects which range from coughing or shortness of breath, to worsening asthma and even an increased risk of death from heart disease.

Associate chair of epidemiology at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health, Sara Adar, said: ""The environmental community has been working very hard for the past 10 to 15 years to be able to predict exposures.""

A range of data was drawn on, including measurements from the Environmental Protection Agency and details about nearby factors that could affect air quality - such as the recent wildfires in Canada which caused air quality warnings to be triggered across major US cities.

""They model all sources at once. Coal-fired power plants, agriculture, wildfires, traffic, all these different emission sources, and then they turn off the source in the model one at a time. And then they can see the difference in what levels are there with the emissions sources, and what are there without them,"" said Dr Adar.

Modelling found the higher risk even after adjusting for a range of potential other factors would could impact results, such as sex, race and ethnicity, educational status and wealth. They were also able to adjust for whether people have previously lived in urban or rural areas.

While they had information about where people moved during the course of the survey, Dr Adar acknowledge they didn't have enough data to model every single exposure or check for every difference throughout the course of their life, such as where people were born, which could have impacted results.

""Dementia takes a long time to develop,"" said Dr Adar. ""It's not something that might be, 'oh you've got a bad exposure last week, and now you have dementia'. It's more likely to build up over a lifetime.""

Beyond direct emissions from wildfires and agriculture, Dr Adar said their analysis was able to take into account other kinds of air pollution that can also be traced back to these sources. When wildfires burn it isn't just the smoke that fills the air people have to worry about.

Other toxic molecules can be carried with the smoke as they burn through communities. Farming can also worsen air pollution, as a result of ammonia released by sources like manure and fertiliser.

""Farms will release a lot of ammonia gas, and then in the air with the sunlight and other pollutants out there, they'll react to make particles, and those particles are what we see are likely toxins for the brain,"" said Dr Adar.

Dr Adar and Boya Zhang, a fellow researcher at the school, say they hope their new findings could help drive more targeted interventions to address dementia risks. The study's authors wrote: ""Unlike many other common risk factors for dementia (eg. hypertension, stroke, and diabetes), exposures to air pollution can be modified at the population level, making it a prime target for large-scale prevention efforts.""

Catacanthus incarnatus, which feasts on crops including cotton and corn, has been renamed Hitler as the design on its back resembles the Nazi dictator's face

A bug renowned for its awful stink has been renamed after Adolf Hitler as the unusual design on its back resembles the evil Nazi dictator.

Native to south-east Asia and India, the insect known as man-faced stink bug is a notorious pest and known to devour fruit, cotton, corn, soybean, and cashew crops.

Now the Catacanthus incarnatus has a new reason for its infamy as it was renamed Hitler.

The New Indian Express said: ""The trend of naming the bugs after popular personalities started recently when Catacanthus Incarnatus was named Hitler as it resembles the face of the German dictator.""

Other species had been named after Bollywood icons like Amrish Puri and AK Hangal, according to the newspaper.

The aim is said to ""to create interest in research students by making the study of bugs easier for identification"".

Wildlife watchers gave a mixed reaction to the comparison.

Photographer Michael Lassle, who spotted the insect in Langkawi, Malaysia, said: ""Arthropods don't need Hitler!

""I guess there is some resemblance with a stylised Hitler as there is with the Napoleon spider and Napoleon.

""But different people might see different things in nature and I therefore prefer 'man-faced stink bug' as a nick-name.

""If I were the bug I would certainly not like to be compared with Hitler.""

David Ong, who photographed the creature in a forest near Kuala Lumpur, said Elvis was a better comparison but added he ""did not mind"" the nickname.

He said: ""It is fine as it is only a common name - it's more accurate to use the scientific name.

""We called it man-faced without referring to any particular person.""

The creature's most important defence is its odour, according to expert Sadashiv Waghmare, an assistant professor of zoology at North Maharashtra

University in Jalgaon, India.

He added: ""It secretes odour smells through its stink gland, which is located on its metathorax, for protection from enemies.

""It is a very common species.""

The Catacanthus incarnatus was discovered in 1778 by British entomologist, Dru Drury, according to Scientific American magazine.

At temperatures recorded during Europe's devastating Cerberus heatwave, the brain sends signals telling the body to shut down, while just a couple of degrees hotter and eath becomes a real possibility

Millions are set to roast in 48C conditions as a double heatwave turns up the heat to unprecedented levels.

The searing conditions will heighten the risk of heat-related illness and even death with livelihoods also at risk as entire fields of crops and livestock are set to be decimated as Europe turns into an oven.

Europe is already suffering under a heatwave called Cerberus - which is named after the triple-headed hound of Ancient Greek lore that guards the entranceway to the lower circles of Hell in Inferno by Dante Alighieri - which has created a sizzling atmosphere touching the high 40s.

Images from Croatia show tourists and residents from wildfires as others in Greece are seen trying to stay cool by wetting their heads with fountain water.

Cerberus is an anticyclone that originated over the Saharan desert but has pushed north in recent days from Italy, now affecting Croatia and causing life-threatening wildfires.

Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey have all been put under the grill in recent days with the heatwave expected to turn up its intensity before the end of next week.

But Cerberus is just the start of the apocalyptic round of heat pounding the continent.

Looming in the wings is Charon - a heatwave with a similarly infernal moniker that is named after the ferryman who carries condemned souls across the River Styx into Dante's Inferno.

Charon is expected to break records as it follows the devastation wrought by Cerberus.

At such highs, heat can cause a number of lethal changes to the human body. At 39-40C, the brain sends signals to the muscles telling them to slow down, causing the patient to suffer severe fatigue.

Just a couple of degrees hotter and heat exhaustion becomes likely. At 41C the body starts to shut down, with the upper lethal limit believed to be somewhere between 40 and 50C.

Italy is currently in the critical zone, with its first recorded death reported earlier this week.

The 44-year-old road worker was on the job when he collapsed in Lodi, southeast of Milan, amid reports of 45C heat.

Two Italian brothers, six and seven, also indirectly fell victim to the extreme heat when they drowned in an irrigation basin after seeking a cooling sanctuary from the atmospheric oven in Manfredonia, on Italy's eastern coast.

And in Rome yesterday British tourists were spotted fainting under the sheer pressure of the searing sun.

Concerned locals were seen dishing out water bottles in the hopes of alleviating the severity of the weather.

There appear to be no signs of the rolling heat slowing, with southern Spain bracing for a 44C high today, the same as is expected in Greece this week.

The conditions are expected to last another two weeks, with Cyprus (41C), Croatia (39C) and France (34C) all to be affected.

Feeling thirsty is a signal from the brain to replenish body fluids when dehydrated - when diabetes is untreated, the kidneys must work harder to filter excess glucose

Diabetes is a relatively well-known condition that affects more than 4.3 million people in the UK.

Many will recognise its major symptoms, which include fatigue, weight loss without effort, and feeling more hungry than usual. However, fewer know about a more unusual symptom of the disease - excessive thirst.

Excessive thirst, or polydipsia, crops up with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Type 1 is an autoimmune condition that means a person's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys its own insulin-producing cells such that the body is unable to regulate blood sugar levels, whereas Type 2 is an issue of insulin resistance - the body still makes insulin but is unable to use it effectively.

Feeling thirsty is a signal from the brain to replenish body fluids when dehydrated. When diabetes is untreated, the kidneys must work harder to filter excess glucose and expel it from the body through urination. But if you're not drinking enough to compensate for this fluid loss, the kidneys may take fluid from body tissues and urine to clear out the glucose.

If you are drinking more to quench your thirst, you'll urinate more often - hence excessive thirst and frequent urination usually come together.

It's worth bearing in mind that excessive thirst isn't necessarily a warning sign of diabetes. Many medications cause thirst and dry mouth, including:

Polydipsia isn't just irritating - it can lead to serious health issues further down the line if left unchecked. Prolonged dehydration can cause nausea, dizziness, headaches and fainting. And ironically, dehydration means one urinates less, such that the body may not be getting rid of excess blood sugar - shooting up blood sugar levels.

Dry mouth may be a symptom of conditions besides diabetes, including:

Treating excessive thirst

If diabetes is the underlying condition behind excessive thirst, getting that under control is the first step to finding relief. Insulin therapy, administered by injection, insulin pump, insulin pen, or inhaler, is often used to manage diabetes. Oral medications are also available.

But in the short-term, strategies like sucking on sugar-free hard candy or chewing sugar-free gum can make you produce more saliva. Over-the-counter saliva substitutes are also available.

Cutting back on caffeine - which exacerbates a dry mouth - and avoiding mouthwashes that contain alcohol can also help. So too can sipping water throughout the day.

Jeremy Clarkson is back for another year in the life at the Diddly Squat farm as harvest season begins, but The Grand Tour presenter is in dire straights

Jeremy Clarkson is returning to Amazon Prime screens with a fresh series of Clarkson's Farm this month.

Yet it's not all sunshine on Diddly Squat Farm as Britain's best-known but least-qualified amateur farmer is seen in the initial episode in dire straights a year since the Amazon cameras last rolled.

The series opens in the summer of 2021, and from the off the future of the farm is hanging in the balance following a disastrous annual profit of £144 the previous year.

Since then, Clarkson tells viewers he has started growing durum wheat, added millions more bees to the fold and has ambitious plans to open a restaurant on the farm - which has hit headlines in recent months after it provoked a vicious battle with the local council.

Clarkson introduces viewers back to his Chipping Norton abode at the Diddly Squat farm shop, which has seen fans of Clarkson and the show flock to the premises to go home with a bottle of apple or bee ""˜juice'.

However, the former Top Gear presenter stands alongside his farmhand Kaleb Cooper in the middle of his jam-packed car park and despairs as the road chaos the shop traffic has caused.

Jeremy says: ""Last week, the main road jammed up for three hours. People couldn't get vaccinated at the health centre. They couldn't get a crew for the fire station.""

Amid the unprecedented demand, Clarkson and his team were forced to mow two acres of wheat from the nearby field to make more space for cars to park - but even that wasn't enough.

A sober Clarkson says: ""I just didn't think it through. I didn't think this many people would come.""

Later in the premiere episode of the series, Clarkson turns to the task of harvesting his crop for the season, on a wing and a prayer the 520 acres will rake in more than the princely sum of the previous year.

The team started in the barley field, where they harvested three trailers-worth of crop while a combine harvester bestridden Clarkson bemoaned: ""I just don't have the mentality to be a farmer. I just lie in bed thinking the barley's out there and it's past its best.""

The barley is taken to the storage area, where an unwanted surprise awaits: the ""˜local vandals' have paid the area another visit and set fire to a second farm bund.

Clarkson tells the Amazon cameras: ""I was talking to the rural crime police the other day and they have had their Mitsubishi taken away and they've been given a Vauxhall Corsa.

""This is the United Kingdom - the sixth richest country in the world. How the f***ing hell are they going to catch anyone in a Corsa?""

Clarkson's Farm Series 2 launches Friday, February 10 on Prime Video

The highly-'flavoured' crisp brand have taken a British potato field - with a 'billboard' over a 73,532 square foot in size

Walkers has created the world's biggest-ever 'billboard' - a 73,532 square foot 'cropvert' - created in a British potato field.

Yorkshire-based potato farmer Tim Rodwell helped the crisp brand turn roughly 30,000 potato crops into its biggest and most unusual campaign to date. The artwork is so big it's visible from space, and outsizes the biggest standing billboard in the world - which covers 67,382 square feet.

It took a week to hand cut, with drones used to mark out the precise shapes required, before hoeing the crop by hand to spell the message ""˜Great Taste Starts Here', alongside the outline of a packet of Walkers crisps.

The campaign was designed to highlight the brand's commitment to using 100% British potatoes, which are sustainably grown. Rodwell is a Farm Manager and pulled off the ""˜cropvert' alongside a small group of Walkers' potato growers, just before the potatoes were harvested and sent off to be turned into crisps.

Using just hand tools, the team were able to ensure no potatoes were harmed along the way. Walkers farmer Tim Rodwell said: ""I am incredibly lucky to have grown up on a farm, and now am I am proudly farming potatoes for Walkers.

""It's not every day that you get to use potato crops to make a giant message for Britain."" Rachael Smith, from Walkers, added: ""We care about our farms and farmers because we care about our delicious crisps.

""We are committed to using sustainable practices that protect the environment, as we know the best quality crisps start with the best quality potatoes. That's why we couldn't be prouder of this unusual collaboration and resulting ""˜cropvert' that communicates this message to the nation.""

Theresa May shared an image of former Prime Ministers at the Cenotaph - but there were only six in the shot, with flash-in-a-pan leader Liz Truss cropped out

Former Prime Minister Theresa May has shared a photo of former Prime Ministers together at the Cenotaph - with one figure missing.

Mrs May posted an image on Twitter showing Boris Johnson, herself, David Cameron, Gordon Brown, Sir Tony Blair and Sir John Major earlier today. But it was quickly spotted that flash-in-pan PM Liz Truss had been cropped out.

Eagle-eyed users were quick to spot this. One posted: ""Theresa May cropping Liz Truss out the ex-PMs photo is very, very funny."" Another wrote: ""Thank you for cropping out Liz Truss. Next time get Boris out too.""

It is unclear whether this was deliberate. Alongside the picture of the six former PMs, which also features current incumbent Rishi Sunak, Mrs May wrote: ""Each year on Remembrance Sunday, we assemble at the Cenotaph to honour the sacrifice of the fallen and pay tribute to the servicemen & women we place in harm's way. Today - as every day - we will remember them.""

For the second year in a row there were seven living former Prime Ministers present for the Remembrance Sunday commemoration. Despite her disastrously short spell in No10, Ms Truss is expected to attend the annual event for the rest of her life, despite not lasting long enough to lay a wreath as PM.

The number of surviving ex-premiers has swelled after seven years of turmoil which has had five occupants of 10 Downing Street. When Gordon Brown became PM in 2007, only three of his predecessors were still alive: Sir Tony, Sir John and Baroness Margaret Thatcher. Of the seven living ex-PMs, three are still under 60: Mr Johnson, aged 59; Mr Cameron, 57; and Ms Truss, 48.

Sir Tony is 70, Mrs May is 67, Mr Brown is 72 and Sir John is 80. With the next general election due no later than January 2025, a Conservative defeat at the polls could see this group grow even further, from seven to eight.

A cruel dog owner has been fined and banned from owning animals for two years after vets realised he had illegally cropped his 11-week-old puppy's ears during a routine vaccine appointment

A man has been banned from owning animals for two years after a vet realised that his 11-week-old puppy had been illegally mutilated.

The vet reported Tyrese Dawood, 22, after a second visit, becoming aware that his American bully Draco didn't have cropped ears when he had come in for his previous appointment, two weeks earlier.

Dawood, of Wendover Road, Urmston in Manchester, was sentenced at Manchester Magistrates' Court on Thursday June 29 after pleading guilty to one offence of allowing a dog's ears to be cropped, which is an unnecessary surgical procedure where they are altered in appearance.

As well as a two-year ban on owning animals, the cruel owner was told to pay a £500 fine and ordered to pay £2,000 in costs and a £50 victim surcharge.

Draco had been taken to the vets on February 2, 2021, for vaccinations, when his years were fully intact. Then the sweet 11-week-old puppy was taken to the vets again on February 16, but this time with cropped ears.

In a statement, the vet said: ""The surgery appeared to be either professionally done or completed by someone with plenty of experience. Although Draco was not suffering at the time of the examination, the mutilation of the ears was unnecessary and against the Animal Welfare Act 2006. The ears were previously in perfect condition.""

Dawood had bought the pup for £2,000, but when visited by the RSPCA, he wrongly told inspector Emma Dingley that Draco had been stolen - and when he returned his ears were cropped.

Inspector Dingley looked into the alleged theft of Draco, but didn't find any evidence of it happening, and the police were also not aware of it.

In a statement given to the court, inspector Dingley said: ""The vet states when he challenged the male regarding the ears the male shrugged his shoulders and said his brother arranged for it to happen. Later that day I interviewed Mr Dawood at his home address contemporaneously under caution, with a solicitor present. Mr Dawood provided pictures of Draco and some scissors he used to remove the staples from Draco ears.""

An expert vet who examined Draco said: ""Tyrese Dawood indicates that on February 8, 2021 he was aware that Draco was experiencing pain as a consequence of wounds on the ears. The wounds also had metal staples applied to them. Despite being aware Draco was in pain, Dawood removed the metal staples from the ears himself rather than seeking veterinary advice and treatment, such as appropriate pain relief.

""In my opinion Draco was caused to suffer due to Tyrese Dawood failing to seek prompt veterinary advice and treatment for the ear wounds which he knew to be causing Draco pain. Suffering would have been experienced by this animal via mechanisms of pain and irritation which is likely to have persisted for a period of at least three days, possibly longer.""

After the sentencing, Inspector Dingley said: ""Ear cropping is a horrific immoral, unnecessary and repulsive practice which has absolutely no benefits for the dogs and can cause them lifelong health, behavioural and social problems.

""This is done purely for cosmetic purposes. We would urge the public and anyone looking to buy a puppy to remember this is an illegal procedure, which has a hugely negative impacts for the dogs themselves.""

Draco, who has been renamed Obi, has since been happily rehomed.

The Mormon cricket - which got its name in the 1800s after ransacking crop fields in Utah - can grow more than two inches long and turn cannibalistic when their food supplies, crops and other vegetation, runs out

A ""biblical"" storm of crickets has descended on a town in Nevada, with one hospital covered with the insects.

Some parts of the state are now overrun by the cannibalistic bugs, with businesses taking to social media to show how they're fighting the Old Testament plague.

In the northeastern city of Elko, roads, crops and walls were covered with the miniature beasts, with one shocking video showing the extent of the infestation.

Hospita' staff have had to resort to grabbing leaf blowers and brooms to blast them out of the way.

Communications officer of the affected Northeastern Nevada Regional Hospital, Steve Burrows, explained: ""Just to get patients into the hospital we had people out there with leaf blowers, with brooms.""

Speaking to KSL TV, he added: ""At one point we even had a tractor with a snowplow on it just to push the piles of crickets and move them on their way.""

The ""Mormon"" cricket is native to the US, and got its name after being discovered first in Utah in the 1800s.

Its population swells and declines in a several year cycle, but many residents of the 20,000-person town are far less than pleased over their return.

Elko resident Precious Drake said: ""They're just gross.

""They look like spiders, and they poop everywhere.""

Researchers at the University of Nevada said the cricket can grow larger than two inches long and are often found in grassland close to the Missouri River.

All the poop comes from their diet of grass, shrubs and crops, and their ravenous appetite has a knock-on effect on the food chain, affecting the amount of feed left over for livestock.

When they gather en masse, their feeding can lead to a number of further environmental concerns like soil erosion, nutrient-depleted soil among other issues.

If the vicious insects can't get their nutrients from vegetation, they will turn on their fellow crickets, eating each other whether dead or alive, says USAToday.

The university said that the creatures aren't actually crickets, but ""shield-backed, short-winged katydids"".

They ""resembled fat grasshoppers that cannot fly"" and feature long antennae, a shiny body and come in a number of different colours, it added.

""[Mormon crickets can cause] substantial economic losses to rangeland, cropland, and home gardens,"" the university said.

""This is particularly true as adults and nymphs of Mormon crickets migrate in a band, eating plants along their paths.""

Similar scenes erupted across Nevada, stretching up to Montana, as local authorities battled the plague last year.

The bugs prefer arid conditions brought on by drought and warming temperatures, which has lead to more devastating outbreaks across the West.

The official definition of an infestation is when at least eight crickets occupy a square yard, Utah State University said.

During the spring, conditions in Utah have been cold and wet, meaning there have only be a few smaller-scale infestations, the state's public radio said.

Val Bourne is an award-winning writer, organic hands-on gardener and committed plantaholic - and here she gives readers the full lowdown on growing your own veg

Among his recent musings about the progress of his allotment, our much loved diarist Paul Routledge revealed his secret weapon.

""There are lots of helpful books,"" he said. ""I swear by Val Bourne's Ten-Minute Gardener's Vegetable Growing Diary."" Val is an award-winning writer, organic hands-on gardener and committed plantaholic, with an allotment in rural Gloucestershire. She says: ""My hundred or so dahlias are not appreciated by my Best Beloved, although he'll take all the plaudits once they're in flower.""

Val manages her third of an acre garden without using chemicals - something she has always believed in. Her latest book The Living Jigsaw, is all about her eco-friendly garden. She has been interested in the natural world since childhood and has actively tried to influence gardeners to be greener in order to help the survival of our planet.

Val, who is an ambassador for The Hardy Plant Society and worked in vegetable research for five years, has been judging RHS plant trials for the past 16 years. In this National Allotment Week, Val has written an allotment guide for Mirror readers and allotmenteers of all levels - with advice for newbies, next level gardeners and even suggested a bit of fine tuning for those so experienced it's not just their fingers which are green...

Advice for Allotment Newbies

If you're at the ""˜shall I or shan't I stage', put your name on the waiting list anyway. Most people wait for years to get one and by the time they're handed on, the new tenants usually have to reclaim them from the wilderness. This can take several years of hard work. Just think of it as productive Pilates with back ache.

Once you've got one, have a good recce round the site, taking special note of the more productive plots. They'll indicate what grows well and what doesn't. Take note of any communal facilities. There may be a shared water supply, a pop-up shop or a shared composting area. Finally, be friendly and chat, because experienced plot holders will be generous with their advice. They may even give you their spare plants!

Assess your soil. Pick up a small handful and squeeze it together in the palm of your hand. Clay soils form a ball and this tells you two things. The ground will compact if you walk on it, so order in some scaffold planks now. Clay soil lies claggy and cold in winter, so you must wait for good weather before doing any planting or sowing. This may well mean ignoring the instructions on the packet! There is some good news: clay retains moisture and nutrients.

Lighter soils won't stick together, but they will always be hungry for nutrients and water, so get the water butts and cans in now. Your light soil is hungry and well-drained, so you'll be able to sow earlier than many. Build your compost heap, whatever your soil, but never add any diseased material, pernicious weeds or seedheads. They'll come back to haunt you.

You are nothing without good tools. The essentials are a spade (and I like stainless steel because it cuts through the soil), a long-handled digging fork, a Dutch hoe, a garden rake and a wheelbarrow. Bulldog Tools (www.bulldoghandtools.co.uk), made in Britain, offer great value and quality. They'll last, as long as you clean and store them. Car boot sales often have gardening tools.

Time to tackle the weeds, but don't go down the chemical route because wildlife's in a parlous state. If you have pernicious weeds with deep root systems, bindweed, ground elder, horsetail or perhaps all three, the best way is to hire a rotavator and chop the roots up, preferably during winter. It sounds counter-productive, but it works. After that, it's consistent spade work, literally worrying the blighters into submission. Hoe off emerging annual weeds, or pull the larger ones up, before they annoy your neighbours. Hoeing creates a fine tilth, which acts as a moisture-saving mulch.

The Next Level - Planting and Sowing

Subdivide your plot into three, so that you use a simple rotation system to reduce diseases and pests. Plot 1 will contain potatoes in the first year. Then there'll be legumes, onions and roots. In the following year it's brassicas. Perennial crops such as rhubarb will also need a place and I'd find room for a New Zealand blackberry named ""˜Karaka Black'. Ripe fruit can be eaten straight off the bush in summer. It will need netting. Always record what's planted, where. The memory plays tricks!

Begin by planting sets of golden-skinned onions and shallots in March, if conditions are favourable. They're more cold-tolerant than red-skinned varieties. Expensive heat-treated sets, which are less likely to bolt, are only worth it in drier areas. Onions need water early on and take 20 weeks to ripen. ""˜Centurion' and ""˜Sturon' are both reliable. Shallots, which need a warmer site, take 26 weeks to ripen. Lift them as soon as the foliage begins to die back. Onions keep until early spring, shallots for far longer.

Broad beans, which crop by June, can also be planted in March. Raise them in modular trays if you can. Form a double row a foot apart and space each bean 9 inches apart. Add a framework of canes and string. ""˜Masterpiece Green' crops well. Pick off any blackfly early on.

Wait for the weather before sowing seeds of carrots, parsnips and beetroot seeds. They need night-time temperatures approaching double figures to germinate. Sow too early and you'll end up having to do it again. Use wide 4-inch drills, half an inch deep, because it saves thinning out.

Water the drill well before sowing and aim to spread the seeds thinly across the drill. Record the sowing date on the label. Start with a fast-maturing carrot such as ""˜Amsterdam Forcing' and then sow ""˜Eskimo' or ""˜Autumn King' for later crops. Carrots should take 10-21 days. Parsnips take 30 days and the F1 variety ""˜Gladiator' is my choice. F1 seeds are more vigorous at every stage, including germination. Sausage-shaped beetroots mature faster so find room for F1 ""˜Alto' as well as a globe like ""˜Boltardy'.

Mid-April's the time to plant potatoes, because you don't want the tops to catch a May frost. Use an early, like ""˜Maris Bard'. Chit the tubers, ie let them develop shoots, before planting them a foot apart in rows two feet apart. Plant ""˜Little Gem' and ""˜Salad Bowl' lettuces between the rows. Dig earlies as and when you need them and pop seeds of dwarf French beans ""˜Safari' or ""˜Stanley' into the empty gaps.

Maincrop spuds, which don't need chitting, are planted 18 inches apart. They store over winter, but need to be harvested before the end of September, otherwise little black keeled slugs spoil the flavour. The disease resistant ""˜Cara' is still popular. Pea ""˜Hurst Greenshaft' provides a June crop. Create a foot-wide trench and zig-zag the seeds across because you'll need ""˜one for the crow, one for the mouse and one to grow'. Add a few mangetout seeds at the ends. They'll crop first.

Going to a Higher Level - Fine Tuning

Select better varieties with the word ""˜flavour'. Ignore exhibition varieties, unless you're planning to enter a vegetable show. Be very wary of the word ""˜new'. Go for AGM (Award of Garden Merit) winners. Essex-based vegetable specialist Kings Seeds give discounts to the National Allotment Society (NAS) and other allotment groups. Contact them directly - www.kingsseeds.com or 01376 570 000.

Everybody plunges into growing summer crops, but they arrive all at once. The most useful, budget-busting crops are those in your winter pantry. Freshly cut cabbages, leeks in white sauce and nutty roast parsnips - picked week after week. Find room for Tuscan black kale, because it can be harvested in autumn and winter. ""˜January King Marabel F1' is a great winter cabbage. Purple sprouting crops in March and April. Cauliflowers are impossible for many - including me.

Grow hybrid runner x French beans. ""˜Moonlight' and the later ""˜Firestorm' both crop heavily in hot or cool weather. If you prefer runners, ""˜Polestar' is my favourite. Borlotti beans, which you harvest and dry, are easy too. If your plot's windy, use tripods rather than rows. Always grow winter squashes. Plant them outside in early June. Harvest them when the stems are corky and leave them for six weeks so that they develop a chestnut flavour. I'm too cold for butternuts, but the grey-skinned ""˜Crown Prince' and the orange-skinned ""˜Sunshine' and ""˜Uchiki Kuri' crop well here.

Sweetcorn, which freezes well, takes up little room because this wind-pollinated crop is planted in a block. ""˜Swift' is my go-to. Find room for some pollinator-friendly flowers. The blue field scabious, Knautia arvensis, lures in lots of bees on my allotment. Plugs and seeds are available. I also grow dahlias.

Make sure you plant Bocking 14 comfrey next to your compost heap. This clump-forming, non-seeding comfrey is adored by bees and the leaves can be used as an accelerant in the compost heap. You can also make comfrey tea, just as good as Tomorite.

A calf that was born with smiley face markings on its belly is to be spared the abattoir and will now have a life as a ""lawnmower"".

Megan and Barry Coster breed about 700 calves a year at their stud farm in Ripplebrook in West Gippsland, Australia, but have never seen markings like this.

The black and white Holstein calf will now be allowed to roam around and eat the lawns of farm workers, living a happy life in its new job as a lawnmower.

The calf has been nicknamed Happy because of its markings, which resemble two eyes, a nose and a smile.

The markings were first noticed by farmer Mr Coster when he was checking on his livestock on the farm near the town of Ripplebrook, in the state of Victoria.

""We've seen some number sevens or love hearts on the head and a few strange markings, but we've never seen anything that resembles a smiley face before,"" Mrs Coster told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

""A few of our workers are keen to have him as a pet and a lawnmower in their yards. He'll be around for a while.""

He continued: ""I couldn't believe it ""” I actually zoomed in at first to make sure that none of our workers had added some extra lines or anything.""

Happy became a quick hit on social media after Megan's post.

""Wow that's one for the record books surely,"" one person commented.

""Oh my heart that is beautiful,"" another person wrote.

""Even if you don't want to name your livestock sometimes they demand it,"" a third person said.

Shola Ogueboule from Eid In The Park explains five key points about one of the biggest events in the Islamic calendar - Eid-al-Adha - and what the 'Festival of Sacrifice' entails

Today marks the start of Eid al-Adha which sees millions of Muslims around the world celebrate one of the biggest events in the Islamic calendar.

The holy holiday, which runs from Wednesday, June 28 to Sunday, July 2, is known as the ""˜Festival of Sacrifice' - and traditionally sees Muslims arrange for the sacrifice of a livestock animal to mark the celebration, which commemorates a significant Quranic story.

It follows Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan - the month of fasting, and takes place as the annual Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca concludes.

Countless events will be taking place over the next few days to honour the festival, including those organised by Eid In The Park, which has been bringing people together in Manchester since 2017.

Volunteer Shola Ogueboule says it is their mission as organisers to follow the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad and promote community cohesion.

Regardless of age, gender, or beliefs, everyone is welcome to join their celebration, which sees more than 20,000 attendees.

Shola has put together five key points that both Muslims and non-Muslims should know about Eid, including dispelling the biggest misconception about the festivities - which assumes animal cruelty.

1. What Eid is really about

""Eid al-Adha is sometimes misunderstood, leading to misconceptions such as the belief that it is solely a solemn occasion or that it promotes animal cruelty. In reality, Eid al-Adha encompasses a celebration of faith, love, and compassion.

""It encourages individuals to reflect on their own sacrifices and inspires acts of kindness towards others.""

2. Spirit of sacrifice

""Eid al-Adha calls upon Muslims to embody the spirit of sacrifice by participating in the traditional ritual of animal sacrifice. However, it is important to clarify that this act is carried out ethically and with consideration for animal welfare.

""By engaging in this act of giving, Muslims symbolically demonstrate their willingness to sacrifice for the sake of others, reflecting Prophet Ibrahim's obedience to Allah's command.

""Islamic teachings emphasise ethical slaughter, known as Halal meat, which prioritises animal welfare. Halal slaughter encompasses the humane treatment of animals throughout their lives, ensuring they are not mistreated or subjected to pain. It also includes providing them with sufficient space to roam, clean water, nutritious food, and fresh air.

""In addition to these guidelines, Halal slaughter involves selecting healthy animals for the sacrifice, using a sharp instrument for a swift and painless slaughter, and mentioning the name of Allah.

""In the UK, what usually happens is that money is given to charities to slaughter and distribute to the less fortunate, as regular Halal meat isn't the same as the special sacrifice.""

3. Embracing unity and generosity

""Eid al-Adha is a profound celebration that extends far beyond indulging in feasts and festivities. It serves as a powerful reminder of the values of love and unity.

""During this sacred occasion, communities come together, joining in communal prayers, sharing meals, and exchanging heartfelt gifts. Regardless of race, gender, or nationality, Muslims strive to treat their neighbours with kindness and spread happiness.

""Embracing the beauty of diversity and fostering harmony, Eid al-Adha nurtures a sense of belonging and deepens our understanding of one another. It is through this collective spirit that we truly experience the essence of togetherness and the power of unity.""

4. Self-betterment

""Muslims embrace the sacred act of sacrifice as a testament to their faith and compassion. By partaking in Udhiya - sacrificing of a livestock animal - individuals reflect on their actions, seek forgiveness, and embark on a fresh chapter of spiritual renewal.

""It's about letting go of past grudges and mistakes, engaging in sincere repentance, and infusing your life with righteous deeds. Just as the Quran states in Chapter 3 Verse 134: 'Who spend in the way of Allah both in plenty and hardship, who restrain their anger and forgive others. Allah loves such good-doers.'""

5. Reflect, repent, and rejoice

""Eid al-Adha provides a meaningful opportunity for Muslims to engage in sincere repentance and seek forgiveness from Allah.

""This auspicious time prompts individuals to reflect upon their actions, forsake disobedience, and embrace repentance with sincerity. It is a time to renew spiritual commitments, combine repentance with righteous deeds, and strive for success.

""As the Quran states (28:67): 'But as for him who repented, believed, and did good, he will be among the successful.'

""Eid Mubarak!""

A stunning tourist hotspot in Wales has become a prime photo-taking opportunity for visitors, but people taking selfies have now caused a newborn foal to fall to its death off a cliff, the pony's owner has claimed.

Horses have grazed on the cliffs of Gower in Swansea for generations, but after several ponies have died, farmer Nicky Beynon has banned visitors from touching the horses. Three of Mr Beynon's ponies died last year after being hit by cars, and are frequently harassed by tourists who are wandering on the cliffs where the horses graze. Now, the 60-year-old is questioning the ponies' future on the cliffs.

The National Trust has become involved following the increased incidents with the horses, and has now warned visitors to stick to the countryside code, which says to give wild animals, livestock and horses plenty of space, and to follow farmers' directions in order to keep everyone safe.

Mr Beynon farms in Llangennith and Rhossili, and said his gypsy cob ponies are overwhelmed by people trying to touch them and take selfies up close, according to reporting from the BBC.

Mr Beynon said: ""They all want to take a photograph, but they don't realise what they're doing - the amount of stress they're putting on the animal.""

The farmer said the foal's death happened in April, and only months earlier had been born just a few hundred yards from the cliff edge. When the foal was being born, Mr Beynon said people were crowding the horses and trying to take photographs.

He said: ""All of a sudden the newborn is staggering to its feet, trying to learn how to stand up, and trips over the edge. The mare who lost her foal over the cliff, she's quite a sharp sort of sensitive mare.

""The foal had gone over about half an hour before I found her and she was just going ballistic. She knew the foal had just vanished."" Since the incident, Mr Beynon has been taking each of his mares home so they could foal safely.

Last year, a drone was flown around the headland, just 10ft above one of the ponies' heads. Mr Beynon said the pony was spinning around, trying to work out where the noise was coming from.

The farmer said the person using the drone could not understand how much stress he was putting the pony under, and said there was no need for the drone to get so close to the horse. Mr Beynon has already had to stop grazing sheep on the headland after a series of dog attacks, including when a sheep was eaten alive by someone's pet Alsatian.

A Swansea resident who regularly visits the area said she had to intervene several times when she sees people scaring the horses. Louise Church, 47, said in April, just before the death of the newborn foal, she was forced to stop a man who was chasing a pony to get a photo.

She said the ponies are not domestic, but are wild animals. And just four weeks ago when she was walking her dog, she said she saw a family with a three-year-old girl who had walked up to the back legs of a horse and was stroking its legs.

Ms Church said: ""The parents were oblivious. If the horse had kicked her she would have been in serious trouble"".

The National Coastwatch Institution, based on the cliff, said it is having to issue warnings on a daily basis for people to stay back from the ponies. In a post on social media, the organisation said: ""It was only recently we had to transport a young lady up to the car park after she had been kicked by a stallion near our hut. We did what we could, first aid-wise, but she found walking difficult.

National Trust Cymru, Gower said the area ""is home to a variety of special wildlife and livestock that grazes freely across the common land and meadows"". It asked everyone to keep to the countryside code and observe its guidelines.

We have joined the British and Kenyan Red Cross to witness the pain and suffering caused by drought in East Africa, with babies, adults and elderly people left to suffer on a daily basis

East Africa is experiencing its worst drought since 1984, with adults, babies and elderly people dying of hunger every 30 seconds.

Richard Blewitt, executive director of international for the British Red Cross, described the food crisis as ""catastrophic"" and said it is a ""deadly emergency"" on a scale that we have not seen in recent history.

The United Nations has yet to formally declare an official famine, but everyone on the ground knows it is an unprecedented situation and desperate action is needed soon to save lives soon.

The Daily Mirror's chief reporter Andy Lines and photographer Adam Gerrard visited the village of Lomirok where they spoke to residents who have lost their loved ones due to the crisis.

They met Loripu Kiru, who lost his 14-year-old daughter Nateen and his 62-year-old brother Eglan to starvation.

Africa food crisis - how to help

They also spoke with Jackson Namulen, 54, who lost his two wives, which is allowed under Kenya culture.

Ekibo Ndot, 67, wearing her favourite pink jumper with roses, lost her seven-year-old grandson Lorot just seven weeks ago on March 3.

Cows and goats have become so valuable now armed gangs ambush shepherds and farmers shooting them to steal their animals.

The death of so many millions of animals has meant there just isn't enough food for people to eat any more.

Each family used to have their own prized herds of cows and goats, but with no pasture for the livestock to graze on almost all of them have died leading to a desperate lack of food which they would kill and sell.

The chupacabra is said to be a demonic creature that drinks the blood of livestock, including cows, chickens, ducks and turkeys, with many ""victims"" found with sharp puncture wounds on their necks

A mythical creature known as ""˜the Goat-Sucker' is feared to have struck again - this time feasting on chickens, ducks and turkeys.

The animals' strange wounds prompted many locals to believe it was the work of a ""˜chupacabra'.

The dead birds were all found with unusual wounds on their backs.

They were allegedly caused by the demonic creature - whose name translates as ""˜goat-sucker' -who allegedly drank their blood.

The macabre discovery took place near the town of TecpÃ¡n, Guatemala, on June 11.

It is unclear if locals have taken any action to prevent Chupacabra from carrying out a repeat attack in the near future.

On 24 March, a similar incident took place in the same region.

In total, 75 animals were found dead, including chickens, ducks and pigs.

Many locals attributed the animals' deaths to the mythical Chupacabra.

Last week, the demonic creature allegedly devoured several cows, llamas and alpacas near the Bolivian city of Oruro.

Farmers feared they were killed by Chupacabra due to the injuries on the animal's necks.

Locals reportedly erected fences around their livestock in response to the alleged demonic attack.

Last month, Chupacabra was allegedly responsible for the death of a ram in Mexico.

The dead animal was found in the rural village of Leona Vicario, about 25 miles west of the Mexican resort of CancÃºn.

Despite some residents believing a wild cat could have caused the animal's death, many attributed it to the Goat-Sucker due to the mysterious bite marks on its neck.

There have been numerous alleged sightings of Chupacabra in the Americas since the 1970s, including as far north as Maine in the US and as far south as Chile.

However, all reported sightings have been disregarded as anecdotal and lacking evidence.

In other paranormal news, a mass burial pit stuffed with the remains of hundreds of vampires was found by workers digging up a road in Poland.

Roadworkers found 450 suspected bloodsuckers in Luzino, in northeast Poland, many of which had been decapitated and posed in strange positions.

Some of the skeletons had a coin in their mouths and skulls between their legs - which 19th Century Europeans believes would reverse the ""vampire curse"".

Maciej Stromski, an archaeologist called in to excavate the bones, said: ""We discovered examples of belief in the dead returning from the grave, which could only be stopped by decapitation.

WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGE: Cats have reportedly been found spiked on poles in the New Forest and a lamb was slaughtered with a bible placed on it as locals fear ""˜Satanists' are back in the quiet village

Concerns are growing that ""˜Satanists' have returned to the New Forest after the discovery of a lamb with its throat slashed.

The area was put on alert in January and also back in 2019 after pig hearts were ripped out with sheep and cows also culled.

Cats have also reportedly been found spiked on poles by horrified residents.

Villagers fear the individuals who carried out the barbaric occult-style killings may have struck again.

Patrick Langdown, 66, was called to the national park in Hampshire near where he lives after a member of the public made the grim find.

The farmer was shocked and saddened to realise it was one of his own.

He says he has been made aware of a recent incident involving a dead lamb with a bible placed on it.

His two-month-old animal was dumped at a pond, he said.

He told the Telegraph: ""There's been weird things happening in the forest for a while now, with the dead sheep and the cats on poles and all those bits and pieces.

""I did have five sheep killed last year, and their skins were left behind, and in another field, some of my sheep were let out and got poisoned by rhododendron plants.

""It leaves a bitter taste. You don't sleep. Any bang, any noise, you wonder what is going on. One day, hopefully, they'll make a mistake.""

Andrew Parry-Norton, Chair of the Commoners Defence Association, called the attack ""mindless"".

He said: ""From a CDA point of view the attacks are horrific but it also create shockwaves throughout the commoning community.

""It is not only a financial loss but the emotional upset it causes. We all worry about our stock as it is, but this is mindless.""

Four years ago, police investigated after a sheep was killed and sprayed with occult symbols, with several cows were also wounded in the woodland.

Rev David Bacon, vicar of Bramshaw, said the attacks on the animals left people ""disturbed and scared"".

He went on: ""We have had very very minor incidents in the past, little bits of graffiti, it doesn't happen very often, nothing like this.""

The mythical creature has become known as 'Goat Sucker' - but there has never been conclusive proof it actually exists Now . a group of men have claimed to have shot one one in South America

Hunters claim to have shot dead a Chupacabra goat-sucker in a rainforest before discovering it had 'human-like' hands.

The mythical demon-like creature is believed to have terrorised farmers and farm workers by sucking the blood of livestock. It has become known as 'Goat Sucker' - but there has never been conclusive proof it actually exists.

The Daily Star reports a group of men have now claimed they gunned one down in a forest in Guia Lopes da Laguna, near SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Footage shared online by hunters show the dead creature which appears to have human-like hands and razor-sharp teeth. Its body, meanwhile is said to be roughly the size of a large monkey.

One of the hunters said they came across the creature while hunting wild boar on the edge of town. He claimed they chased the creature and their hunting dogs fought with it, before one of the hunters allegedly shot it. A video was then filmed as 'proof' the creature was dead.

Not everyone believes it is the legendary creature and some sceptics believed it could be the decomposing body of a howler monkey. The species are native to South and Central American forests and are commonly found in the area. But they eat leaves, as well as fruits, nuts, and flowers.

Reports also said the animal appeared to be dead for several days and not a fresh kill, like the hunters claimed. Local authorities have not commented on footage. The Mirror reported in June the creature was feared to have struck again - this time feasting on chickens, ducks and turkeys.

The animals' strange wounds prompted many locals to believe it was the work of a ""˜chupacabra'. The dead birds were all found with unusual wounds on their backs.

They were allegedly caused by the demonic creature which has grown something of a legendary status among local people. The macabre discovery took place near the town of TecpÃ¡n, Guatemala, on June 11.

Lough Neagh's water is being poisoned by blue-green algae caused by a lethal combination of record high temperatures, high nutrient levels, an increase in invasive foreign zebra mussels

The UK's largest lake, which supplies 40% of the water to Northern Ireland, has turned a toxic green and the environmental disaster is being underplayed, according to Friends of the Earth.

Lough Neagh's water is being poisoned by blue-green algae caused by a lethal combination of record high temperatures, high nutrient levels, an increase in invasive foreign zebra mussels which filter the water and long term neglect. It is also impacted by the suspension of Stormont which means politicians aren't overseeing decisions made about the lake.

The blue-green algae, is not really algae, but a type of bacteria called cyanobacteria. It is found in fresh and coastal waters and needs sunlight, nutrients and carbon dioxide to grow. With the extra zebra mussels in the water the sunlight can burst through, growing the algae and in turn suffocating the fish. The algae can cause skin irritations or upsets stomachs if ingested while swimmming and can even prove fatal for pets and livestock.

Friends of the Earth's James Orr believes the disaster - which is seeing a green slushy waste left across the surface - is being underplayed because it's not happening on the mainland of the UK. He said: ""Lough Neagh is the heartland of Northern Ireland. This is our Loch Lomond, our Lake Windermere. If this was happening in England this would be such a massive story that you couldn't get to the House of Commons, there'd be so many outraged people outside.""

He told Sky News: ""Lough Neagh has become like a toilet. That feeds the algae, the algae in turn grow in very prolific numbers, they suck the oxygen out of the water and they start feeding themselves to the point that it becomes frenetic. It becomes a toxic soup.""

Public anger is growing over the state of Lough Neagh and a vigil has been held with campaigners describing it as a wake for Lough Neagh. More than 100 protesters, many dressed in black, carried a coffin to the shoreline to represent their concerns that the lake is ""dying"" due to pollution.

The BBC's Northern Ireland politics correspondent Jayne McCormack explained: ""If Stormont was sitting, we'd have an environment minister, who could bring in new policies and actions. They'd effectively be the public face accountable for what different government agencies are doing. But Stormont has been suspended for nearly 19 months, so its left to civil servants who are unelected and unaccountable, to tackle the issue without any major political intervention.""

Five men were each jailed for five years for killing, skinning the carcasses and smoking the bones of a tiger and her cub in Thong Pha Phum National Park in Thailand in 2022

Five poachers have been jailed for slaughtering a tiger and her cub.

Each of the men was sentenced to five years for killing the majestic creatures in a national park in Thailand in 2022.

The court in Kanchanburi Province, around 90 miles west of Bangkok, said the men prowled through Thong Pha Phum National Park before shooting the big cats.

They then skinned their carcasses and smoked their bones with the intention of selling the parts on the black market.

Every part of the tiger, from whisker to tail, has been found in illegal markets across the globe.

Their bones are often used in medicine and folk remedies and the skin is often seen as a symbol of status for some communities in Asia.

Rangers discovered the illegal material in January 2022 before seizing the body parts and photographing themselves with the haul.

Official images taken in the jungle showed two tiger pelts, with bones and carcasses on the floor.

In court, the men claimed they killed the animals as revenge for livestock attacks.

The court said the men, who lived in a remote village, should have been ""protective of nature"" considering their home was surrounded with it.

Tigers are currently endangered, with just 4,500 thought to be still in the wild.

The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) says the numbers of the big cats have dwindled to just 200 in Thailand despite recent efforts to increase the tiger population.

The illegal trade in dead tigers is largely driven by Chinese and Vietnamese buyers, who use their skin, bones and other body parts for traditional medicine.

Critics argue that there is very little verifiable scientific evidence or studies to support their effectiveness.

Charoen Jaichon, the directors of Thong Pha Phum National Park, said he was ""happy that justice has been delivered"".

He added: ""This is a strong warning to any illegal hunters in Thailand's national parks.""

Kim Jong-un has ballooned to over 22 stone despite starvation deaths tripling in North Korea in just one year with Pyongyang elite sent to work on rice farms

North Korea has ordered city workers and students to toil on its rice farms, after spy chiefs revealed starvation deaths have tripled in the country this past year.

Government officials and students have been sent from Pyongyang to farms in South Hwanghae Province, according to Daily NK, a newspaper based in neighbouring South Korea.

Even Russian diplomats have been called upon for ""goodwill labour"" - with propaganda photos showing consular staff at work on a vegetable farm near Nampo city.

It comes after South Korean spy chiefs revealed that starvation deaths in the North had tripled this past year, despite Kim Jong-un ballooning to over 22 stone.

South Hwanghae has been called the ""bread-basket"" of North Korea, since it's less mountainous than most of the country and better suited to farming.

But it's a far cry from the capital, Pyongyang, where the Kim regime elite live in comparative comfort with their families.

""Lodgings are being set up throughout farms in the province for all the volunteers who are coming down from the capital to help,"" a local told Daily NK.

""The areas where fast-growing grain is being watered and fertilised, and rice seedlings are being transplanted are crammed with volunteers.""

The rumours were all but confirmed by a recent article from KCNA - the government's own news agency.

The piece praised workers' efforts to complete rice transplantation in the region, and acknowledged ""helpers from ministries, national institutions and other units"".

The work of the Russian diplomats, meanwhile, was described by another propaganda outlet, the Rodong Sinmun.

It said they had helped weed a field at Kochang Vegetable Farm, a joint venture some eight miles southwest of their embassy in Pyongyang.

On its Facebook page, the embassy said the farm was growing potatoes, corn and soybeans, and that they had dined on some of its produce after helping.

It's a different story for North Korean citizens, however.

The National Intelligence Service (NIS) of South Korea revealed the surge in starvation deaths at its northern border in a briefing for politicians on Wednesday.

Yoo Sang-bum, who was there, recalled: ""We were told that corn prices in North Korea surged 60% and rice 30% from a year earlier, reaching the highest levels since Kim Jong-un rose to power.""

The briefing was also the source of new reports that Kim Jong-un is an insomniac, and that his weight has soared to a staggering 140kg - over 22 stone.

""North Korea is importing large amounts of Marlboro and Dunhill cigarettes and expensive delicacies,"" said Mr Yoo.

""So the agency is looking at the possibility that Kim's reliance on alcohol and nicotine has increased and is making his insomnia worse.""

Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean elite, said Kim may be cracking under the pressure.

He said: ""In more functional totalitarian political cultures, like in North Korea or in China under Chairman Mao, there is a tremendous amount of pressure created, aided and abetted by the leader.

""But eventually the leader himself can fall victim to that pressure as his aides and subordinates become inert or overly cautious in their work as response.""

Mr Madden, a fellow of the Stimson Center in Washington DC, also highlighted the dictator's increasingly infrequent public appearances.

Kim Jong-un vanished from the public eye for almost a month from mid-April.

""It is too speculative to suggest that he has a terminal illness or serious chronic health condition,"" said Mr Madden.

""However, given the NIS report, we might ask if he has largely withdrawn from public engagements due to a series of minor health issues, like insomnia.""

A hill farmer and guardian of one of Snowdonia's great heritage treasures has explained why visitors are being denied full access to the site after he dug up a car park

A farmer who is the guardian of one of Snowdonia's most treasured heritage sites has explained why he is denying visitors full access.

Landowner Meredydd Williams dug up a small car park at Tomen y Mur near Trawsfynydd, Gwynedd, due to a disagreement over the site's management. Visitors can no longer fully explore the most complete Roman military settlement in Wales, described by the National Monuments Record of Wales as ""one of the premier archaeological landscapes"" of upland Wales.

Mr Williams took action when he became upset by a perceived lack of action over activities he alleged were damaging the site. He claimed some tourists were disrespecting its archaeology by climbing on delicate structures, potentially causing damage.

He claimed others were parking up overnight and ""nighthawkers"" armed with metal detectors were sneaking onto Tomen y Mur in search of ancient artefacts. Mr Williams said his public liability insurance could be affected should there be an accident.

He was also angered by alleged damage caused by trucks passing the site and accused heritage body Cadw, which manages the site with Eryri National Park Authority (NPA), of failing to order remedial works. ""Serious damage has been done, these activities are scarring the landscape,"" grumbled Mr Williams, who's been irked by some online jibes. ""It's a disgrace. I'm being made to look like the bad guy when really I'm the good guy.""

Frustrated by what he sees as a lack of action, he shut down the site's layby parking and took away Tomen y Mur's interpretation boards, damaging one in the process: he plans to pay for its replacement. Mr Williams then started building a new, larger car park on his land, hidden by trees and gated to stop overnight use. It will be ready soon, but it might not be welcoming visitors for a bit.

Last year, a voluntary access agreement between the landowner and Eryri NPA was not renewed. Neither party has come back to the table for discussions and Mr Williams claims he's been left to enhance site facilities from his own pocket.

He trims surrounding gorse to prevent encroachment, and he's constructed a small access gate for less-abled visitors to reach the site. Fences were lowered to improve views. To avoid damaging the ground, he's fitted his tractor with extra-large tyres.

""With help from my neighbours, I've been looking after the site for as long as I can remember,"" said the third-generation farmer. ""But it's got to work both ways - they've got to work with me to stop the illegal activities. 99% of the visitors are great but 1% like to dig up the site and cause trouble.""

On the former layby car park, he has plans for a ""Mabinogion garden"" to acknowledge the site's importance in Welsh mythology: as Mur-y-Castell, it was the legendary palace of Ardudwy. Eryri NPA said it cannot comment on the arrangements.

A spokesperson said: ""As part of the access agreement, which has now lapsed, parking provision was formerly made available to visitors on a private roadside parcel of land. This is no longer available.

""Alternative or additional parking provision would require the necessary consents. The authority is unaware of any such proposals and therefore we cannot comment on these until we have received further details.""

Tomen y Mur was a Roman military camp built in the late first century to subdue the Ordovices, a native Celtic tribe. Initially, a large timber fort was erected to house around 1,000 cavalry. Later, as tensions eased, the fort was rebuilt in stone early in the 2nd century to accommodate a much smaller force of around 500 infantry. Only a few decades later, it was abandoned.

The site, which might have once been a court for the princes of Gwynedd, is dominated by a large mound, likely raised by Normans in 1095 to counter a Welsh uprising. It's thought that some of the fort's stone was later used to build Harlech Castle. The site remained occupied until the early 20th century and even had a slate quarry tramway running through it, offering a unique glimpse into life over nearly 2,000 years.

Mr Williams, who has an access agreement for the site, gets £35 a week. In exchange, he agreed to reduce the number of sheep on the land by 75%, which has hit his farm income. He said the money does not make up for the unpaid work he and other farmers do as unofficial guardians of Tomen y Mur.

He often walks around the site to check its condition and look for safety issues. Once, he found people climbing the chimney of a ruined farmhouse, partially restored by Eryri NPA in 2006. Some visitors have ignored requests not to jump from walls. ""If anything goes wrong, it will be me who answers for it,"" Mr Williams said.

Eryri NPA investigated claims of damage to the site but decided no action was needed. They said concerns were raised about ""damage to the scheduled monument"". They added: ""However we understand that these have been investigated and subsequently concluded by Cadw and North Wales Police, who are the relevant authorities on such matters.""

Many features remain as earthworks outside the fort - a large parade ground, bathhouse, mansion, roads, bridge and burial mounds. Overlooking the parade ground was a possible temple complex and the fort had a small weapons training amphitheatre, a facility described as ""unique in Britain"" by Gwynedd Archaeological Trust.

In the absence of an access agreement, the fort and associated features can currently only be viewed from public footpaths which run nearby. Closest parking is in laybys on the A470. A Cadw spokesperson said: ""We have worked in partnership with Eryri National Park and the private owner of Tomen y Mur for many years to support the conservation of this important historic site and make it accessible for visitors to enjoy.

Marian Clode was flipped over a fence as she walked along a path during a family holiday in Northumberland with her young grandchildren and died two days later in hospital

A farmer has admitted a health and safety breach after a teacher was killed when she was ""thrown like a ragdoll"" by a stampeding cow which had broken free from its holding pen.

Marian Clode's family recalled at an inquest into her death how she screamed as the animal charged her and was then flipped over a fence where she lay dying, succumbing to her injuries two days later in hospital. The attack came as she walked along a path during a family holiday in Northumberland in 2016 with her young grandchildren. Today, Alistair Nixon, 62, on behalf of the JM Nixon partnership, which runs the farm, admitted a health and safety breach at their farm in Belford, Northumberland.

The 61-year-old primary school teacher, from Greater Manchester, had been staying at a holiday cottage at Swinhoe Farm, near Belford with her family. On April 3, 2016 they walked to St Cuthbert's Cave - a route they had done ""many times"", Newcastle Coroners' Court previously heard. The 61-year-old had been walking along a public bridleway with her husband, Christopher, daughter Lucy, son-in-law Kevin and two grandchildren, aged seven and eight when about 15 cows and their calves surged from a holding pen.

During the inquest into Mrs Clode's death Coroner Karen Dilks told the jury that on that day, Swinhoe Farm owner Alistair Nixon was moving cattle from their winter sheds into open fields, for the first time in months. As Mr Nixon prepared to make the move, some of the cows broke loose from the holding pen and ran past him onto the public bridleway.

At the time Mrs Clode and her family were about to arrive back at the farm from their walk when ""around 15"" cows appeared over the brow of a hill. Ms Dilks said the topography of the area meant neither the group of walkers nor Mr Nixon could see over the hill at the time. Reliving the incident, Mrs Clode's daughter Lucy said: ""My mum was leading the walk at that point. We were about two minutes away and I think she just wanted to get back and get settled.""

As the animals appeared over the hill, Lucy said: ""It was about 15 cows stampeding towards my mum, that's when I realised we were in trouble. There were hedges on either side and barbed wire. As the cattle came over the brow of the hill I could see Kevin literally throw the children over the barbed wire and I could see my mum, who was in the most danger, stand to the right hand side and tuck herself under the gate by the tree. She had no time to do anything.

""I got over the fence, I cut my knees on the barbed wire. They were running very very fast and we were trying to get out of danger. The lane dropped which naturally slowed [the cows] and they didn't know what to do. The lead cow, this big black cow, slowed down, so they all slowed down. It must have caught sight of my mum.

""It turned, backed up, hit her, backed up again, hit her again, backed up again and hit her, and flipped her over the fence like a ragdoll. Before the first charge my mum knew it had seen her and was going to attack her - she screamed. That was the last thing she ever said.""

Lucy said: ""It was a nightmare because the cows were all there, and separating me and Kevin from mum was this thicket hedge. Instinct took over, I pushed myself through the thicket hedge and managed to get to mum. Kevin was phoning the ambulance and my mum was dying, basically.""

The inquest heard Ms Clode was airlifted to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, where she died on April 5, 2016.

Lucy told the hearing the family had booked a holiday at Swinhoe Farm, which has a riding school and holiday cottages, for a third time after enjoying previous trips. She said: ""We particularly liked it because we booked the kids in to do horseriding. The farm advertises that it's plentiful for walks with direct access to St Cuthbert's Cave. We were on a road, my mum was exactly where she should have been, we were not in a field. She did what she could and what a lot of people would advise.""

A statement from Mrs Clode's family said the mother-of-three was a ""hardworking and dedicated teacher"" who ""lived for her family"" and ""adored and doted on her four grandchildren"". They said: ""It's heartbreaking she never got to see them grow up, or meet her fifth grandchild. The events of April 3, 2016 cut her life short in the cruellest possible way. Her life was over in an instant, and the lives of her family were changed forever.""

Today Alistair Nixon, on behalf of the JM Nixon partnership, which runs the farm, admitted a health and safety breach during a hearing at Newcastle Crown Court. He admitted that the business failed to ensure the health and safety of persons other than employees by exposing them to risks to their safety from the movement of cattle.

Judge Tim Gittins indicated he will pass sentence on Thursday, having heard from the prosecution and defence on Wednesday.

The hearing continues.

Kelvin Fletcher and his actress wife Liz ditched showbiz three years ago to take on a 120-acre holding on the edge of the Peak District - and are now starring in a new farm show

After more than 20 years playing Emmerdale farmer Andy Sugden, Kelvin Fletcher must have learned a thing or two about rural life.

But all that pretend lambing and mucking out can't have put him off - because now the actor has become a farmer for real. Kelvin and his actress wife Liz ditched showbiz three years ago to take on a 120-acre holding on the edge of the Peak District.

The couple now have 100 sheep, 30 pigs, 10 horses, six chickens, a cat and Ginger the dog. Oh, and four children under the age of seven. Next week, Kelvin and his brood will be back on TV for new ITV documentary series, Fletcher's Family Farm.

But today, they also have a rather inexperienced farmhand to, er, help out on the land. Me. Before I pull my wellies on though, I want to know what it was that made the soap star and 2019 Strictly winner turn fiction into fact.

""People make an obvious connection to Emmerdale,"" he says. ""So you play a farmer all those years, then you become one. Life imitating art. But I was an actor. I had zero farming knowledge. There might be a scene where I was next to a sheep, but that was it. The storylines were deaths, affairs, storms.

""I don't know what the catalyst was for becoming a farmer. Emmerdale [shot on a country estate in West Yorkshire] was an amazing place to work. It is aesthetically beautiful, so maybe that was part of it.

""But it's like doing Strictly. You do all right so people assume you must have had some dance training when you haven't. Liz isn't from a farming background either. Really, we got into it by accident and we've literally been learning on the job.""

With no farming experience and a young family to raise, Kelvin, 39, says the lifestyle change has certainly been a culture shock. He and his childhood sweetheart Liz, 38 - best known for her role in 2016 BBC drama In The Club - have been up since the cock crowed with 16-month-old twins Mateusz and Maximus, along with Marnie, six, and four-year-old Milo. Forming a morning ""tag team"", one feeds the twins while the other gets the older kids ready for school.

""We're always late,"" says Kelvin. ""I don't know how everyone else does it. Their kids run into school pristine, while Marnie runs in late with a bed head after feeding the pigs."" Like most modern farmers, the couple have diversified. The farm cottage is a holiday let and today, a camera crew has rented out the space for a fashion shoot.

So, with the eldest kids at school and the twins under the watchful eye of their grandparents, the couple start to work through the neverending list of jobs on the farm. ""We've had a medical emergency,"" Liz says. ""A lamb is ill so we need to go to the farm shop for medication, if you don't mind coming.""

We all pile into Kelvin's rickety Land Rover and en-route, the couple tell me how they ""accidentally"" swapped showbiz for life on the farm. They had planned to move to California, but were grounded by the pandemic. ""It was Kelvin's idea,"" Liz says. ""We had two children, no real responsibilities, they weren't at school, we had no jobs""¦ then all visas got stopped, but we were in the mindset for change.

""Kelvin saw this farm on Rightmove and said, ""˜Liz, what about buying this?'"" Kelvin, who expertly navigates the country roads while tucking in to a bacon sarnie, adds: ""We didn't do it because we wanted to be farmers. We wanted something different.

""We looked at all sorts of places but the thought of this quiet, idyllic life got us. Then, lo and behold, it's not as quiet as you thought. There are sheep, so you think, ""˜I'll get some more sheep'. Then it snowballs.""

With the emergency medication for the poorly lamb collected, it's back to the farm - but Kelvin sadly warns me: ""I think we will lose this one today."" Liz adds: ""It's the circle of life - even the kids understand that now. They get to see the magic of the babies being born but understand that sometimes, they die.""

Meanwhile, with no farmhands to help with the dirty jobs, they tell me I'll be mucking in - and out, too. My first task is feeding their herd of Oxford Sandy and Black pigs - and mucking out their barn. The minute the four sows and 25 piglets hear Liz rummaging in the feed bin, they race to the gate. We're nearly bowled over by the 200lb sows, pushing their piglets aside to reach the food first.

It's all a far cry from stylish Liz's old life in Manchester, where she loved dressing up. Nowadays she's more likely to be found wearing leggings and wellies. She says: ""When I first arrived here, my only wellies were ones I'd bought for £3 from Asda for a festival.

""I never imagined wellies would become the most important item in my wardrobe."" All this as well as being a full-time mum. But she explains that the kids all muck in, too. Liz says: ""The twins are usually in their buggy watching, while Milo and Marnie love collecting eggs from the chickens and feeding the pigs.""

Kelvin adds: ""The kids are getting a good grasp of life and all it entails - having empathy with animals and each other. Farming involves life and death, hard work and is for ever changing."" This year's commitments made it too hectic for a family holiday so Kelvin took the older kids camping in the forest. But back to today, and with the pigs sorted, we move on to sorting out the sheep.

Not content with farming, parenting, filming and acting - which they both still do - the couple have also hosted family events on the farm, including an Easter trail during lambing season. And they're gearing up to transform it into a festive village for Christmas.

Kelvin says: ""We've found this massive love for everything a farm represents - hard work, early mornings, challenges and laughs. ""You are covered in muck but you are really happy.""

Fletcher's Family Farm begins on ITV on October 15 at 11.30am and on ITVBe at 7pm

Patrick Atherton and his pet were saved after seven cows knocked them to the ground last summer in Devon and thankfully only suffered from cuts and bruises in the attack

A farmer has been fined after a retiree and his dog were nearly trampled to death by cows on a public footpath.

Retired chartered surveyor Patrick Atherton, 70, and his 13-year-old Border Collie ""˜Lad' were knocked to the ground by seven cows while walking in June last year. They were only saved when someone - believed to be the farmer - waved the cows away, leaving Patrick with cuts and bruises in what could have been a fatal attack.

Sadly, Patrick's dog Lad suffered serious injuries in the incident after being repeatedly kicked and stamped on by the cows - which on average weigh nearly 700kg. Patrick, originally from The Wirral, Merseyside, says that he thought he was going to die during the attack at Birdcage Farm, in Ottery Saint Mary, Devon.

He said: ""I've been a trainer of Border Collies for many years. It was ironic that for the first time I had kept Lad on his lead as I had noticed two young calves in the field and thought if he was walking by my side they wouldn't really notice.

""Unfortunately, one black cow did and it charged at us, knocking me down by the hedge that bordered the path. I tried to stand up and let Lad off his lead but they kept on knocking me over. There was about seven cows involved, but it was the very aggressive black cow that was trying to kill my dog. I thought we were going to die. I had been powerless to do anything.""

Throughout the traumatic ordeal, Patrick also was forced to listen to Lad shrieking from pain as he was attacked by the animals. Thankfully the collie survived his injuries - but had to be medicated for the rest of his life, and was never the same.

Patrick added: ""We were both surrounded by cattle. I could hear Lad shrieking in pain as he was repeatedly kicked and stamped on. He was never the same dog after what happened and he sadly passed away in September this year.

""I just want to make other people aware of the risks when out enjoying popular footpaths such as this one."" The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigation following the incident found that cattle with young calves were being kept in a field with a public right of way across it.

Cattle with calves are known to be protective and can be aggressive to walkers, especially to those with dogs. Between 2018 and 2022, more than 30 people were killed by cows in similar incidents - while others have been left with life-changing injuries.

Due to these dangers, farmers are encouraged to cull any aggressive animals or avoid putting the animals in fields with public access. Public entrances to fields containing potentially dangerous cattle, stating clearly whether there are cows with calves or bulls in the field.

Farmer John Hallett, who owns Birdcage Farm, later plead guilty to breaching Section 3(2) of the Health & Safety at Work etc Act 1974. He was fined £2,000 and ordered to pay costs of £4,500 at Exeter Magistrates' Court.

HSE inspector Simon Jones said: ""It is fortunate that the injuries sustained by Mr Atherton weren't life-threatening. However given the nature of the attack the end result could have been far worse. Public knowledge - and concern - is increasing about how dangerous cattle can be. On this occasion, Mr Atherton took the right precautions and HSE has taken action against the farmer in question.

""Cattle are extremely protective of their calves and even calm cattle can become aggressive if they think the calves may, in any way, be threatened, even by members of the public walking past. Farmers should not place cattle with calves in fields where members of the public have a legal right to walk. Had John Hallett followed this simple rule, then this incident could have been prevented.""

Another Tears of the Kingdom glitch has been discovered and if you're fast you can line your pockets with rupees before Nintendo patches it out.

Tears of the Kingdom players have stumbled across another glitch that lets you rack up around 5,000 rupees per minute and all you need are some tree branches and a stack of meat.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been full of opportunities for players to make some quick in-game cash thanks to glitches that have remained in the game long enough to profit from. The standout so far has been the dupe glitch for weapons and materials, and the other, even faster dupe glitch that you could use on diamonds and more to get rich quick.

They were eventually patched out in update 1.1.2, but it hasn't taken long for the community to ferret out another way to make money without the hard work. This particular glitch has been credited to YouTuber Suishi but was picked up by Austin John Plays who confirms it currently works on Tears of the Kingdom version 1.0 through to 1.1.2 which is the current iteration.

The list of items you need includes:

You'll need to have Autobuild unlocked as well as armour for the cold or, failing that, lots of spicy dishes to keep you hot. You can find the Archaic Warm Greaves early on in-game, or the Snowquill set from Rito Village which we recommend grabbing as soon as you can as it's one of the best Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom armour sets to survive Hyrule.

It's possible to use this Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom glitch to make as much as 4,995 rupees in just five minutes which is helped along by your ability to mash the A-button at speed. As Austin John Plays notes, if you have an autofire controller this is going to be significantly easier on your button-mashing thumb and make the process a whole lot faster.

Rupee farming with Raw Gourmet Meat and Autobuild glitch

First up, make two meat weapons by fusing the two raw meat to their respective branches to make meat clubs. Then go ahead and fuse those two meat clubs together. Using the Autobuild function and Zonaite, recreate the two bonded meat clubs and attach them to the existing ones for a new Autobuild creation consisting of four meat clubs stuck together.

Repeat this process of using Autobuild and Zonaite until you reach a pre-set build of 16. Attach four more meat clubs to hit 20. We want to get as much out of this glitch as possible, so wriggle one free, then add two more meat clubs so the monstrosity you've created is 21-meat clubs strong. 21 is the max number of items you can drop on the ground at once, so we're really squeezing this for all it's worth. Now wriggle one free and sling it on your back.

Looking in your Autobuild history, you see the 21-meat club creation which you can favourite if you want. Now for the next phase which requires it to be night time, very cold, with a forecast of continued icy weather. Snowfield Stable is a good location as well as the campfire at the Spring of Wisdom close to Mount Lanayru Skyview Tower. There's a Great Fairy Fountain near the stable, as well as the mission for Zelda's Golden Horse so you can check those out if you haven't already. Just keep resting at the campfires until the forecast is what you need it to be.

Now that it's cold and night time, we can test if the conditions are right by taking a meat club - ideally it'll be on your back already if you've been following along with the instructions so far. Walk away from the fire and it should freeze, and drop down onto the ground. That means we're in business. If not, keep sleeping at the campfire until conditions are favourable.

Time for all that hard work to pay off! Pull out your 21-strong meat club creation Autobuild - do not build it. Just have it open and wait a couple of seconds; the meat will materialise and fall to the floor, frozen. Scoop up your 21 frozen meat which cost absolutely nothing to make. Rinse and repeat!

Austin John Plays does the math for you, but based on collecting 21 frozen meat in 10 seconds, you'll be adding 126 per minute to your inventory. That means you can amass one full stack of 999 items in eight minutes. If you manage to make this monstrosity with Gourmet Meat, bearing in mind Frozen Gourmet Meat nets you 40 rupees, you'll be raking in 39,960 rupees in eight minutes, which brings is back to the 4,995 rupees per minute stat we lured you in with.

This Tears of the Kingdom glitch doesn't work with roasting meats, but it does work with Chuchu Jelly. For example, taking out an Autobuild of Blue (water) Chuchu Jelly on sticks in a hot environment will turn them into Red Chuchu Jelly

We don't know when this Tears of the Kingdom glitch will be patched out so we recommend making your fortune with it as fast as you can before Nintendo zaps it with an update.

More than 100 million animals - including mink, fox, raccoon dog, chinchilla and rabbit - are killed each year for their fur, with the creatures typically living in filthy, one-metre squared battery cages

Baby foxes, raccoon dogs and minks are being forced to live in cramped and filthy cages on fur farms in China, born to die for fashion items.

The heart wrenching footage also captured a raccoon dog cub struggling to walk on the wire mesh floor of its cage, while mink are forced to circle around in dirty cages, above piles of excrement.

Investigators also witnessed older animals exhibiting behaviours signifying psychological distress, such as repetitively pacing their tiny cages - barely bigger than their bodies.

More than 100 million animals are killed each year for their fur including mink, fox, raccoon dog, chinchilla and rabbit - three every second. They typically spend their lives in one-metre-squared battery cages and are only moved twice - for weaning and on the day they die.

Since a 2003 fur farming ban in the UK on ethical grounds, over £800 million worth of fur has been imported into Britain, HMRC figures reveal. In the last five years over £28m of it has come from China.

20 years on from the ban, the Daily Mirror and HSI/UK are urging the Government to end this double-standard by banning imports and sales of fur in the UK.

Claire Bass, senior director of campaigns and public affairs at Humane Society International/UK, said: ""This latest investigation has once again highlighted the inhumane treatment animals suffer as fur fashion victims.

""The fur trade would prefer that the grim realities of fur farming were out of sight and out of mind, but as a country we owe it to these animals not to turn away, and to stop being complicit in their suffering.

""Many Britons will be horrified to find out that it is perfectly legal for fur from farms like those we investigated to be sold in Britain.

""A fur sales ban has the backing of over three quarters of the public, and should be an open goal for this Government to deliver on its ambition to be a world leader in animal welfare.""

It is not mandatory to state the country of origin so many fur items on sale in the UK carry no such details.

But a recent HSI/UK investigation found items labelled as Chinese fur on sale in Harrods and Harvey Nicolos.

This is not the first time we have exposed suffering on Chinese farms.

In 2020, we revealed horrific footage of foxes being beaten, skinned and chucked on a heap before their fur is made into fashion items.

Aerial images of the farms in China showed thousands of the animals strewn across the floor - some still alive - waiting to be carted off on the back of a lorry.

TV wildlife presenter and campaigner Chris Packham described it as ""like a scene from hell"" and one of the worst cases of animal cruelty he has witnessed.

A poll carried out in 2022 found that 77% of Brits say the Government should ban the importation of animal products such as fur, where the production methods are already banned in the UK.

The Daily Mirror's and HSI/UK's #FurFreeBritain campaign has so far gathered over 1.1 million petition signatures calling on the UK to ban fur imports and sales.

In 2021, we revealed how experts have warned how filthy fur farms packed full of sick, distressed animals are potential breeding grounds for deadly new pandemics.

Scientists say the stress of being held captive damages animals' immune systems and increases the scale of ""virus shedding"", putting us all at risk of zoonotic diseases - those spreading from to humans.

Covid-19 is thought to have jumped from a pangolin infected by bats to humans at a market in Wuhan.

A spokesperson for the British Fur Trade Association said; ""No fur sold in the UK comes from China, but from certified sources that accord to strict welfare conditions that are independently measured to be among the highest of any in animal husbandry.

""The Government rejected calls for a fur ban because it recognised that it would do nothing to improve animal welfare, whilst recognising the high welfare standards already in place and that consumers should be free to make up their own minds.""

But Claire Bass hit back adding: ""The claim that no fur sold in the UK comes from China is absolutely ludicrous, it's simply untrue.

""It's interesting that the European fur trade is now apparently willing to throw the Chinese fur trade under the bus, but the reality is that wherever in the world fur farming happens, and regardless of how glossy the fur trade's brochures are, animals are suffering the same tormented lives in tiny cages.

""Recent fur farm investigations in Finland - the supposed jewel in the fur trade's bloody crown - found animals with gaping wounds and missing limbs, blinded by eye infections, as well as cannibalism, suffering every bit as disturbing as our investigations reveal in China.

""The only way to stop the sale of cruel fur from China or anywhere else is for the government to ban fur imports and sales.""

After Life star Ricky Gervais, 61, said: ""20 years ago, the UK became the first country to ban cruel fur farming. But now it still has blood on its hands by allowing fur imports.

""That's millions of animals still suffering for fur fashion that's sold here. So my message to the UK Government is simple: end this double standard and ban fur imports.""

In 2021 (the latest year figures are available for), 27,060,000 animals - foxes, minks, and raccoon dogs - were killed for fur production in China.

It is estimated 100 million animals are killed annually for the industry worldwide.

When asked if Harvey Nichols will continue to sell fur products following this investigation, a spokesman said: ""As part of our ongoing review of these practices and continued sustainability initiatives, Harvey Nichols confirms that it will phase out the sale of fur or fur-trimmed products both online and in stores, to be completely fur-free by the end of 2023.""

""Whilst we undertake the phased exclusion, we continue to require any brand that uses fur to adhere to the Animal Sourcing Principles as set out by the Responsible Luxury Initiative.""

Harrods did not respond.

Will Young and Jessie Wynter found each other on Love Island's winter season earlier this year and now they're living their best lives between the UK and Australia

Love Island stars Will Young and Jessie Wynter are gearing up to the next big stage in their relationship. After finding love on the popular ITV programme's winter series earlier this year, farmer Will is reportedly conjuring up a plan to pop the question.

The 23-year-old is 'close to proposing' to his co-star less than a year into the pair's whirlwind relationship. Personal trainer Jessie, 26, is currently living with Will on his family's farm in Buckinghamshire as they 'save for a house'.

Will says he envisions 'babies, marriage and living with Jessie for the rest of his life' as he details what the couple's future looks like as they juggle lives between the UK and Wynter's Aussie home, revealing plans to one day live in both countries.

Hinting at his proposal plans, Will said: ""Last week I made a romantic gesture to Jessie. I won't lie, we are creeping up to the ring. We are creeping up to it."" He told MailOnline that things would become clearer in 'a couple of months'.

""The next thing is going to come and we will keep getting stronger and moving forward,"" he explained while attending We Are FSTVL. Despite his romantic advances, Jessie claims she 'doesn't need a ring' and she knows they 'love each other'. The TikTok star reportedly began 'awkwardly' asking about rings over dinner, thinking he was being 'subtle'. Jessie says she instantly clocked what he was up to. Will admitted he has previously been 'immature' in his first 'serious relationship'.

As the pair enjoy their new lives together on Will's sprawling farmland, the Love Island co-stars still reportedly have their 'silly disagreements'. The couple say they sometimes argue about making the bed, but 'talk through it and move on'.

Directing a journalist at the couple's latest outing, he ordered: ""Get this down, Will Young loves Jessie and wants to marry her. I say this to Jessie all the time, we are going to get married and have kids."" It comes after their recent trip to Jessie's home in Tasmania. After a seemingly successful jaunt, Will revealed plans for them to 'do six months [in the UK] and six months [in Australia]' as they hope to continue jetting back and forth. Will says the decision is down to them both being 'real family people'.

""We are both real family people and I want to spend time with my family and Jessie and she wants to spend time with hers and me, so six months here six months there,"" he told the outlet. Jessie says they are 'not setting plans' because she 'loves the UK'. She confessed the two 'have a joint account' and are 'stingy' as the continue to 'save for a house'. ""I haven't had my nails done in months,"" she explained. Jessie also admitted she never wanted to go on UK Love Island, but had a 'weird feeling' and went for it.

It was built in the 1950s with a diameter of 22 metres and the dam serves as part of an irrigation system with Lake Berryessa a reservoir providing water for agriculture in the Sacramento Valley.

YouTuber Matt Casias sent a drone over the top of the drain hole to capture an amazing view of the water swirling down the 93 metres from the dam. The drain hole can be seen functioning when the water reaches a high level in the dam.

Tragically a woman was killed in the drain hole in 1997 when she was caught in the current and swept down. Emily Schwalek was paddling in the lake and couldn't stop being dragged to the hole, with reports saying that she held onto the rim for about 20 minutes before falling. Lake Berryessa can hold around a 52billion gallons of water before the excess begins to flow into the spillway.

The lake reached full capacity for the first time in 11 years back in 2018 and after a season of heavy rainfall it attracted thousands of curious onlookers a year later. Today, the hole is no longer a safety hazard, as the reservoir is roped off and prohibits swimming or boating.

Drone footage of the hole has gone viral ever since it was posted on social media back in 2018, and it has raked in more than a million views. Some online viewers were spooked by the spectacle.

One comment read: ""Why is there a giant hole in the middle of the lake where people swim, and why is there not a rope around?"" And another stated: ""That right there is the portal to hell.""

Similar to the ""portal from hell"" in California, a fiery pit in Kazakhstan earned itself a similar nickname in the early 1970s when the ground collapsed during a Soviet gas drilling expedition. The hole is 20 metres deep and 60 metres wide. It is located in the Karakum Desert, about 160 miles north of capital city Ashgabat.

The brutal Los Tiguerones gang, linked to the kidnap of 78-year-old British millionaire businessman Colin Armstrong in Mexico, forces new recruits to eat raw human hearts

A feared criminal gang allied to a violent Mexican cartel which forces new recruits to eat raw human hearts has been linked to the kidnap of millionaire British businessman Colin Armstrong.

The brutal Los Tiguerones, whose members identify themselves with tattoos of beret-wearing tigers had been identified as the chief suspects overnight, before police announced Mr Armstrong had been freed. The gang have terrorised their way to becoming one of Ecuador's leading extortion gangs.

Officials were said to have been focusing on the group for allegedly snatching the 78-year-old president of agricultural distribution firm Agripac, after he refused to pay them a monthly protection fee. A well-placed source quoted in the Daily Telegraph said: ""It's the most likely reason for the kidnapping at this point.""

Police have confirmed nine suspects have so far been arrested, although they have not officially said yet whether they belong to Los Tiguerones. The shadowy gang was a small support unit of Los Choneros, one of the South American country's oldest organised crime groups, when they first started rising in notoriety in 2019.

Four years on, the organisation - which in its infancy had just 900 members - has expanded from its birthplace in the northern port city of Ecuador to become a leading player on the national scene as well as neighbouring Peru. The December 2020 murder of Los Choneros leader Jorge Luis Zambrano Gonzalez led to a violent power struggle which came to a head in February 2021, when several sub-groups including Los Tiguerones joined to attack the original gang in three Ecuadorian jails.

The jail massacres, among the bloodiest ever in Latin America, resulted in 79 inmates dying and dozens of others suffering serious injuries. A high-ranking member of Los Tiguerones blamed boredom for another deadly riot in September 2021 at the Litoral Penitentiary in Ecuador's main port city of Guayaquil.

He told local media at the time: ""'We're in a maximum security jail. We don't have communication with anyone, we do not have a television. We don't have many things.

""What do we do? Evil, kill, sell drugs and many other things."" Los Choneros were allied to El Chapo Guzman's Sinaloa Cartel and Los Tiguerones is known to be linked to Jalisco New Generation Cartel.

The cartel is a Mexican organised crime syndicate known for its aggressive use of extreme violence. Last year it emerged the CJNG gang was forcing new members into cannibalism and had started sharing videos of gang members feasting on the hearts of their enemies. Reports at the time said shocking public displays of aggression were used to threaten rival groups and show dominance.

In September this year Los Tiguerones was identified as the leading extortion gang in Guayaquil, the nearest large city to the town of Baba close to the ranch where Mr Armstrong kidnapped from along with his partner Katherine Paola Santos. The glamorous Colombian was released on Saturday after reportedly being sent to Mr Armstrong's son's house with an explosives vest on her which she said would explode if a ransom wasn't paid.

She is understood to have been taken in for questioning after her liberation, amid bizarre claims by a local former MP that she could be involved and had been born a man called Alberto Santos before undergoing surgery which police have so far made no comment on. Los Tiguerones was blamed for 36 per cent of all extortions earlier this year in Ecuador's Zone 8, covering Guayaquil and nearby Samborondon where Saturday's release of Mr Armstrong's partner is said to have taken place.

Local reports said the gang had allied itself with another criminal organisation called Lobos, Spanish for Wolves, in some areas. The reports said small businesses were being charged around POUNDS eight a week but the figure would have been far higher for wealthy businessmen. Earlier this year it emerged Los Tiguerones had also moved beyond Ecuador into Peru and were operating in the northern part of the country's capital Lima.

Criminals involved in a drugs turf war with the gang were blamed for a bomb blast in August last year in the Guayaquil neighbourhood of Cristo del Consuelo which killed five people and left 17 more injured, although initial reports pointed to Los Tiguerones being behind it. In recent years Ecuador has become a favoured destination for criminal organisations in Colombia and Peru smuggling the class A drug into the country before shipping it abroad.

The violent fight for control of the lucrative cocaine trafficking trade involving Los Tiguerones has transformed Ecuador, one of the calmest countries in Latin America until just a few years ago. Like other gangs, members of the Los Tiguerones ink their skin to show who they are aligned to. Police chief Alberto Santamaria has said: ""Los Tiguerones tattoo a tiger with a beret and stars that represent their hierarchy in that organisation.""

A well-placed source said: ""Before entering prison inmates identify themselves with tattoos so they don't get put in a rival wing because they know that if that happens they're going to die."" Confirming Mr Armstrong's liberation in a tweet early this morning, alongside a photo of the British businessman with two police officers.

Ecuador's Police general commander Cesar Zapata said: ""On the road to Manabi our units freed Colin A who had been kidnapped days earlier in Los Rios. At the moment he is safe and healthy. Nine people have been arrested.""

Shadow International Trade Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds has written a letter to the government urging ministers raising his concerns over the 'mess' of a trade deal

Labour has savaged the ""mess"" of the UK's first post-Brexit trade deals which came into force today.

In a stark warning, Shadow International Trade Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds urged ministers to step up support for exporters.

The Labour MP has written to Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch about ""significant concerns"" raised by the Australian and New Zealand free trade agreements.

He told her: ""It is in the hands of your Government to act now.""

The Labour frontbencher highlighted warnings that have been raised by British farmers who say the deal will ""heap further pressure"" on them.

""When it comes to agriculture, it appears that the Australians have achieved all they have asked for and British farmers are left wondering what meaningful benefits have been secured for them,"" the National Farmers Union told a parliamentary inquiry into the Australian agreement.

""There is little in this deal to benefit British farmers. This will just heap further pressure on British farm businesses already facing serious challenges.""

George Eustice - the minister who helped negotiate the trade deal with Australia - has even admitted it ""was not actually a very good deal"" as the UK ""gave away far too much for far too little in return"".

The former Environment Secretary said the UK did not actually need to give Australia nor New Zealand full liberalisation in beef and sheep as ""it was not in our economic interest to do so"".

From Wednesday, tariffs on all UK goods exports to Australia and New Zealand will be removed and red tape slashed for digital trade and work visas.

British goods from across the country including Beano comics, Penderyn single malt Welsh whisky, Brighton Gin and The Cambridge Satchel Co. bags are among the first to be shipped under the new arrangements.

Ministers say young Brits will also benefit from opportunities in Australia under the shared Youth Mobility and Working Holiday Maker visa schemes.

Mr Thomas-Symonds said: ""The Conservatives made a mess of the trade negotiations with Australia - and that's the assessment of their own Ministers who did the negotiating.

""Exports to Australia are falling, based on the latest stats, and we knew the trade deal has huge risks for our farmers, who fear their businesses will be left really struggling. Get this wrong and the Australian trade deal risks worst of all worlds for UK businesses.

""That's why the government need to get a grip and work in partnership with business to grasp any trade opportunities in Australia and New Zealand.

""The OBR predicts U.K. exports will fall by 6.6 per cent in 2023, a hit of over £51bn. We can't go on like this. That's why a Labour government would have a mission to deliver the highest sustained growth in the G7. Plans for this will include boosting green exports and targeting better trade with key allies like Australia and New Zealand.""

Sue Davies, Head of Consumer Rights and Food Policy at Which?, said: ""The success of trade agreements will be judged on what they deliver for ordinary people in their everyday lives, not just the export opportunities they provide.

""The government must use these trade deals to strengthen consumers' rights and protections when buying goods and services from Australia and New Zealand and ensure none of our current standards are weakened - especially around food as this is a key aspect of both agreements.""

Mrs Badenoch said: ""Today is a historic moment as our first trade deals to be negotiated post-Brexit come into effect.

""Businesses up and down the country will now be able to reap the rewards of our status as an independent trading nation and seize new opportunities, driving economic growth, innovation and higher wages.""

Almost 90,000 excess winter deaths were reported as the Big Freeze took a hold, with snow paralysing the country for three arduous months

Large swathes of the UK have been blanketed in snow following the coldest night of the year so far for many places.

The Met Office has issued a new yellow warning for snow and ice and The National Grid has fired up its emergency coal stations to meet the increased demands for heating.

But this frosty blip is nothing compared to the snow of 1962 and 1963 that lasted for three solid months and claimed the lives of thousands.

Dubbed the 'big freeze', temperatures plunged to minus 22C; planes, trains, lorries and cars were grounded; schools were closed and people were trapped in their homes.

Rivers, lakes and even the sea froze over. Birds dropped down dead from the icy skies and the ground was too hard to bury the deceased for three months.

As farming and agriculture took a battering, food prices soared. And with no central heating and limited solid fuel deliveries, residents were left shivering in their frozen houses. Almost 90,000 extra winter deaths were reported during that period.

The coldest winter for 200 years came on the back of a thick smog that descended on the country in early December 1962, killing hundreds.

Then just as that cleared, an arctic storm swept across Europe from Russia, covering the continent in thick snow and cutting off towns and villages.

The first flurries arrived on our shores on Boxing Day. It would be another 10 weeks before it stopped.

As the cold crept in, the sea at Kent's Herne Bay froze so extensively that you could walk out an entire mile on the ice.

In some places temperatures dropped to minus 22C and massive ice boulders formed on the nation's beaches.

Icicles 3ft long hung from roof gutters, and in Oxford, residents were able to drive across the frozen Thames to visit friends on the other side.

Homes were without water due to the mains being frozen, and road tankers armed with supplies struggled to access many areas with snowdrifts up to 20ft deep.

Many struggled to pay for heating, which was patchy at best due to a series of strikes, while rubbish piled up in the streets because collections were impossible.

Tragically, half of the UK's wild bird population is said to have perished in the arctic blast, which came with gale-force winds.

School closures were common and as the big freeze dragged on, telephone lines were brought down and thousands of homes were hit by power cuts.

While a huge number of sports matches had to be called off because the pitches lay below feet of snow, people found new hobbies.

The first ever car rally was held on the Thames and instead of water skiing, people were towed across the ice behind a motor.

The big freeze was caused by an anticyclone, which hovered over Scandinavia and pulled the cold air from the arctic and Russia to Britain.

An area of high pressure near Iceland meant the milder and wetter air from the Atlantic was blocked from reaching Britain and the snow could never thaw.

And still the snow kept coming.

Finally the thaw set on on March 6 when people woke up for the first time in months to no snow anywhere.

So could a Big Freeze 2023 be in store?

Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge explained that it's unlikely we will see such an intense drop in temperatures due to changing weather patterns.

Grahame explained: ""The climate records tell us that winter is changing.

""For example in the decade from 2008 to 2017, the UK had five per cent fewer days where temperatures dipped below freezing and motorists had to scrape their car windscreens nine per cent fewer times because of a corresponding drop in the number of ground frosts when compared with the period from 1961-1990.

""The average winter temperature in the UK has risen from 3.3 C to 4 C between 1961-1990 to 4.0 C between 2008-2017.""

Allen Swinbank, 87, got a call out of the blue earlier this year saying: ""I think my grandad is related to you.""!

Two brothers who knew nothing of each other's existence were finally brought together in their 80s.

Allen Swinbank, 87, got a call out of the blue earlier this year saying: ""I think my grandad is related to you.""

It was his half-brother John's granddaughter Natasha, who had been researching her family history.

The men's father John Spence-Swinbank left Allen's mother when Allen was just six months. Allen, of Goole, East Yorks, said: ""We didn't talk about my dad because my mum hated him.

""He then turned up at my door when I was 26. I did learn a bit about him but he never mentioned I had a brother.""

John, 85, was raised in Bridlington, East Yorks, by his grandad and aunts.

They told him his father died in the war but in fact he died in 1980 aged 68.

Captured at Dunkirk, he spent five years as a prisoner of war and later worked as a bus driver. John moved back in with his mum and baby half-sister aged 10 after his grandad died.

At 36 he moved to Scotland to work as an agricultural engineer and had children with wife Jenny, 76. After Natasha connected them, John travelled from his home in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, to see Allen. They are both great-grandads and love motorbikes.

Allen said: ""We hugged and there were a few tears. It's funny this has happened... in the past few years I've started wishing I have a brother or sister to share things with.""

John said: ""A neighbour of Allen's asked me if I was his brother, she said: ""˜I thought you were, you look like him'. That was a great feeling."" A delighted Allen added: ""We have a lot of catching up to do.

""This is a dream come true.""

Fifteen masked men broke into the ranch complex of former British Honorary Consul Colin Armstrong, 78, on Saturday morning and kidnapped the millionaire and his Colombian girlfriend

The British millionaire kidnapped in Ecuador has been freed.

A gang of around 15 masked men reportedly disguised as police officers dragged Colin Armstrong, 78, from a farm he owns on Saturday morning. He was snatched from his house near the port city of Guayaquil alongside partner Katherine Paola Santos. She was quickly released.

A video has emerged of Ms Santos apparently having an explosives vest removed by a bomb disposal expert. The footage was captured at a property on a private gated estate in Samborondon near Guayaquil, said to belong to Mr Armstrong's son, Nick.

Mr Armstrong senior was found hours after police questioned Ms Santos, thought to be around 30. Yesterday Cesar Augusto Zapata Correa, Ecuador's police chief, posted on X that Mr Armstrong had been discovered on a road near Manabi, not far from where he was snatched. He added: ""Our units released citizen Colin A kidnapped a few days ago. At the moment, he is safe and healthy.

A blurred picture showed the businessman, smiling despite his 72-hour ordeal, flanked by police officers. Police had managed to find Mr Armstrong's black BMW, the car he was driven away in, by activating its tracker device, but it was abandoned by the roadside.

Security officials suspect the brutal Ecuadorian gang Los Tiguerones kidnapped Mr Armstrong after he refused to pay them a monthly protection fee. Los Tiguerones is one of the country's biggest organised crime gangs, running extortion rackets alongside drug-trafficking operations.

The gang is part of the reason Ecuador has experienced a tide of violent crimes and murder throughout the year. Only in August, presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio was assassinated less than two weeks before elections were due.

Cartels in neighbouring Colombia are believed to smuggle cocaine into Ecuador before it is distributed from ports such as Guayaquil. Mr Armstrong, who owns the Forbidden Corner visitor attraction in the Yorkshire Dales, is the president of Ecuadorean agriculture firm Agripac.

Leo Morris, who manages Forbidden Corner and the businessman's other affairs in the UK, said: ""The staff, tenants, farmers and friends of Colin are absolutely delighted at the news. It couldn't have come at a better time.""

He added that Mr Armstrong would be spending Christmas with his family in South America. Mr Morris also praised the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office for helping the family and keeping them updated.

Mr Armstrong was awarded the OBE and Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George for services to the British Monarchy in 2011.

He is a former UK honorary consul to Guayaquil, a voluntary role aiding British nationals in difficulty.

Mountainside vineyards, where Prosecco is produced, are at risk from soil degradation and drought, researchers said. This has an impact on the local economy, study lead author Dr Paolo Tarolli added

Prosecco lovers could be left disappointed in the future as the popular wine risks being wiped out by climate change, environmental scientists have warned.

Mountainside vineyards - where the popular tipple is produced - are most at risk from soil degradation and drought, say experts.

The phenomenon also applies to other famous wines including Burgundy Grand Cru and Cabernet Sauvignon, the world's most popular red.

Study lead author Dr Paolo Tarolli, of the University of Padova in Italy, said: ""The risk is not only losing an agricultural product or seeing a landscape change, negatively impacting the local economy.

""The risk is losing entire communities' history and their cultural roots.""

Winter downpours are also becoming heavier, which raises the risk of soils and terraces being washed away and the landscape depleted, leaving the vines to grow in virtual bedrock.

Over millions of years, erosion has carried soils and water downhill - and this makes it difficult for grapes to grow as they send their roots deep in search of water. Mountain soils also lead to grapes that are small like blueberries.

The regions under threat include the Prosecco Hills of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene in Italy, a UNESCO world heritage site that is responsible for a high-quality wine called Prosecco Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG).

Small grapes have a higher ratio of skin to juice. Because so much aroma, flavour, and tannin are lodged in the skins, mountain wines often have intense flavours and, for red wines, copious tannin and therefore considerable structure.

Tucked into the hillsides of Italy, Portugal, and Spain, they are also the most difficult to maintain - coining the expression ""heroic viticulture"".

Extreme weather and changing socioeconomic conditions are making them even more challenging - and they are the most vulnerable to global warming.

Farmers and scientists must work together to save some of the world's most celebrated wines, says the Italian team.

Dr Tarolli said: ""The great effort required to manage these areas reinforces the specific human-environment connection.

""This is why they are recognised as cultural uniquenesses of primary historical and social importance, where traditional knowledge is still the determining element.""

Mountain vineyards get a lot of sun because of their elevation - from early in the day - and are usually quite a bit cooler.

Vines are showered in luminosity but the grapes do not bake in heat, which gives the final wine balance and a sense of freshness.

The study lists poor soil and less rain as the biggest threat to the industry and also cites several significant socioeconomic barriers.

Dr Tarolli said: ""The last half past century has been characterised by rural exodus and a gradual abandonment of mountain landscapes.

""The new generation is unwilling to continue working under extreme conditions if economic benefits are insignificant.""

Mountain vineyards are expensive to farm. Every bit of the work - from planting a vine to harvesting the grapes - is slow and painstaking.

And it usually has to be done by hand, because most tractors and mechanical harvesters cannot negotiate steep inclines.

They are also part of a larger ""polyculture"", often ringed by forests and other types of vegetation as well as wildlife.

Heroic viticulture sites either have a slope steeper than 30 percent, are located on small islands, higher than 500 metres above sea level or incorporate vines grown on terraces.

The name originated from the inherent difficulty of cultivating and harvesting crops in these landscapes.

Centuries-old examples include the Prosecco Hills of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene, Treviso, and the traditional vineyards of Pantelleria Island in the Strait of Sicily, both of which are protected by UNESCO.

The growing popularity of Prosecco comes at a high cost with an enormous amount of soil lost across steep hillsides.

Demand has soared by more than a third in five years, the fastest of any sparkling wine with champagne showing only around one percent growth over the same time period.

The researchers suggest strategic communications designed to unite scientists, farmers and consumers to onsite solutions like integrated small water storage systems to prevent runoff.

They also underline the importance of educating young people about the benefits of rural communities, preserving cultural heritage, living in equilibrium with the environment and sustainable agriculture.

Dr Tarolli added: ""The key to success lies in combining the traditional knowledge of winemakers with innovation and scientific rigor.

""In this way, farms can work closely with scientists to optimise investments for a more functional, sustainable, and safe agricultural landscape - a winning alliance to face these diverse natural and anthropogenic challenges.""

The findings were published in the journal iScience.

Indica Flower, who expects to retire in her thirties, says living off the land is in her DNA and hopes to run a sustainable farm of her own one day

A woman has revealed how she is saving her earnings from OnlyFans to create an off-grid dream in running her own solar-powered farm with chickens - after claiming she has already made £1.3million in the last few years.

The model, that goes by the name Indica Flower, originally from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, comes from a long line of farmers and says living off the land is 'deeply embedded in her DNA'.

The 25-year-old, who expects to retire in her thirties, wants to ""unlearn"" the ways of living that she says the Western world has taught her, with an aim to grow all her own food, use only solar power and compost everything possible.

But the ethical, environmentally -friendly lifestyle doesn't come cheap, which has seen Indica turn to adult content platform OnlyFans to fund her dream while also spreading her message.

""Agriculture and living with the land is deeply embedded in my DNA,"" Indica, who shares farming videos on TikTok, said.

""Living off-grid and in communion with Mother Nature provides a sense of purpose that nothing else can, in my opinion.

""Raising 'farm' animals (hens for eggs, cows for milk) in a loving, ethical way is so so rewarding.

""I currently already grow some of my own food and have four hens that provide me with lots of eggs.

""Eggs are a main source of protein in my household.

""My family grows sugar cane and also has a couple of communal gardens so I have access to fresh veggies and fruits as well.

""My uncle is a bee-keeper so I trade him eggs for fresh, local honey.

""Being able to know exactly where my food comes from is incredibly rewarding.

""No antibiotics, no chemicals.""

While Indica wants to live off-grid, she still intends to have running water and electricity but powered entirely by the sun.

She is based in urban area at the moment but hopes the £45,000 a month she claims she makes on OnlyFans will soon see her move out to a farm of her own.

She said: ""I hope to eventually have a fully solar-powered homestead.

""But I do fully intend on committing my life to running an ethical homestead and farm for myself and my future family.

""Even though I currently live in an urban area, I've already started my journey.

""I'm currently waiting for the perfect land to purchase.

""I own my current home and have done as much as I can with the space; I've got my hens and I use a hydroponics system indoors to grow my herbs and leafy greens.

""Outside, I am growing potatoes and have a full compost system.

""It's a very realistic goal in my opinion but like all things, it does cost money.""

Indica was a stripper for four years before giving it up for content creation three years ago, and claims she has since made £1.3 million on OnlyFans.

While she gets ""a lot of hate"" online, she says her family have been supportive of her new career.

The model said: ""My parents are very liberal and open-minded.

""It was definitely an adjustment at first, they were more concerned about my safety than anything.

""But since they realized I was healthy and happy, it's just been unconditional love and support.

""I'm so incredibly grateful for them.

""I do get a lot of hate on the internet... [including] comments that say 'I am fatherless' or that something must be wrong with me if this is the career I chose.

""It's 2022. I know it's shocking but some women genuinely enjoy sex and sexual environments.

""Let's stop perpetuating these very harmful narratives.""

But despite the difficulties, Indica loves her job and hopes to buy her land in the next year.

She added: ""I love my job.

""I have an incredible fanbase that truly accepts me for exactly who I am and has supported every endeavour since day one.

""I don't see myself retiring from the industry for at least another five years.

""But I think my journey will start before then.

""I'm hoping to purchase some acreage in the next year or two and then I'll start the official planning process.

""So realistically, [I will retire] in my early thirties!""

Evanna Lynch had a secret relationship with her Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix co-star after the Irish actress was cast as Luna Lovegood for the fifth instalment of the iconic movie series

Luna Lovegood actress Evanna Lynch has spilled on her secret nine year romance with a Harry Potter co-star, which she kept from the public eye.

The Irish actress, best known for for playing the ethereal Hogwarts witch in the film adaptations of J.K. Rowling's bestselling novels, dated Robbie Jarvis, who played a young James Potter, for nine years before splitting up in 2016. The actors first met in 2007 after they were both cast in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, before embarking on a lowkey romance that they mostly kept out of the public eye.

Evanna even convinced Robbie to quit eating meat, dairy and eggs while they were together, after sharing with him graphic information about the animal agriculture industry during a trip to New Zealand. Despite keeping things lowkey, the Luna Lovegood actress paid tribute to her Harry Potter beau in a sweet public tribute in May 2015, taking to Instagram to wish her ""sweetest boy"" a ""happy 29th birthday"" and revealing their plans to see a show together.

After breaking up, they remained amicable and continued to attend vegan events together, according to the Louth native.

Unlike Luna Lovegood star Evanna, Robbie had a minor role in Harry Potter. He played a young James Potter in the fifth movie, but did not appear in any of its succeeding films. He has also appeared in a number of TV programmes, including Genie in the House, The History Boys and Waking the Dead, as well as a handful of stage productions. Robbie has remained vegan, occasionally posting updates about animal rights and plant-based issues to his public Instagram. He also appears to be a new relationship with a professional basketball player named Zoe Fleck, who is also vegan.

Evanna has since moved on from Robbie and is understood to now be dating a mystery French man, as of 2021. The actress introduced the beau, whose name remains private, to her loved ones at her sister's wedding.

""We met in London,"" she told RTE presenter Miriam O'Callaghan in 2022. ""He's quiet. But he's meeting the whole family this weekend."" In the same interview, Evanna spoke about her desire to write fiction after being such a 'book nerd' as a teen. She also discussed her experience of Dancing with the Stars in 2018, on which she placed third.

""[It's a] once-in-a-lifetime thing,"" she said. ""I think I got offered the Irish one but my agent was like ""We'll get more money if you do the US one!""

Marauding colonies of tiny red ants have the power to sting millions every year, with some requiring treatment in hospital, experts fear as they warn of increasing numbers

Experts have warned about increasing numbers of tiny red ants that can cause deadly anaphylactic reactions in some humans and kill most small animals.

The marauding colonies of the bugs will become Australia's worst invasive pest if they're not eradicated soon, the experts claimed in a report. According to the strategy paper prepared for government, if the vicious biting red fire ants infest the whole country, one in three Australians, or 8.3 million people, would be painfully stung every year, with 83,100 victims needing medical attention.

Those numbers, the paper warned, are a ""conservative"" estimate of ants, which have an intense bite that can kill small animals and cause a deadly anaphylactic. They also devastate crops and ecosystems, and colonies will travel serious distances every year if left unchecked.

Although the ant originates in South America, their population has spread globally. It has no native predator in Australia and so authorities there are now very concerned, Nine.com,au reports.

Australia has spent more than two decades desperately trying to keep the ants at bay. In 2001, they were first detected, suspected to have arrived at Port of Brisbane.

And when a nest was recently detected just 5.5km (3.4miles) from the New South Wales border, the farthest south fire ants have ever been spotted, the Invasive Species Council declared New South Wales to be at ""extreme risk"" of being invaded.

This is despite the government in Australia spending $366.9million (£187million) altogether between 2001 and 2017 to try to eradicate the ants. The next four years are seen as pivotal to whether the ants will entrench themselves in the country for good.

Sugar cane farmer Robert Hawken said: ""These things will spread rapidly if they get into the Murray Darling river system."" He explained how the ants have the ability to cling together to form rafts which can then travel unchecked on water.

""They'll float for miles in floodwater and on rivers. So they're very, very difficult to stop once they get going."" Winged fire ant queens can fly a couple of kilometres, but can travel much further when blown by wind currents.

The Lykov family were found by prospectors living in the middle of the icy Siberian forest more than 150 miles from any settlement and had not seen another person in 40 years

The Taiga forest in Siberia is one of the last great wildernesses on earth. Thousands of miles of dense pine forest broken by jagged mountains, where winter snows persist from September through to May. The only inhabitants of these wild lands are usually bears and wolves prowling five million square miles of pristine nature.

So in 1978, when a team of Soviet geologists prospecting for minerals spotted what they thought were signs of human life from their helicopter, they were disbelieving. But as they circled back it became clear, here in a spot that had never been explored, next to a river with no name, 150 miles from the nearest human settlement, was a clearing in the forest with what looked like crops growing.

The four geologists landed and set up their basecamp about 10 miles from the little clearing they had spotted on the mountainside overlooking the river, and they made the trek to meet their new neighbours.

Geologist Galina Pismenskaya recalled the moment she met the man who lived there: ""He looked frightened and was very attentive. We had to say something, so I began: ""˜Greetings, grandfather! We've come to visit!' The old man did not reply immediately but finally we heard a soft, uncertain voice: ""˜Well, since you have travelled this far, you might as well come in.'""

The man, it turned out, lived there with his family, five people in all, in a small, fire-blackened shed filled with birch-bark containers of cut-up, dried potatoes, the Daily Star reports. As the stunned scientists listened, the man revealed the amazing story of how they had come to end up in the middle of the wilderness. The father, Karp Lykov, spoke Russian and revealed he came from a sect of fundamentalist Russian Orthodox Christians called the Old Believers who had long been persecuted by the Tzar and then the Communists.

One day in 1936 a Communist patrol had appeared in their remote village and shot Karp's brother while the two had been working in the fields together. A terrified Karp had gathered his family and fled into the forest. The family, his wife, Akulina; a son named Savin, 9 years old, and daughter Natalia, 2, took some seeds and retreated ever deeper into the forest over the following years, until they ended up at the remote spot the geologists had spotted from the air. The two youngest children, Dmitry and Agafia, had been born in the wilderness in 1940 and 1943 and had never seen a human who was not a member of their family, and spoke in their own odd language.

Their only reading matter was prayer books and an ancient family Bible. Akulina had used the gospels to teach her children to read and write, using sharpened birch sticks dipped into honeysuckle juice as pen and ink. The hardship of their lives was unimaginable, the family had made shoes from tree bark, patched their clothes with hemp cloth they had grown from seed and lived in a state of near-starvation. They had no idea World War 2 had happened or that man had landed on the moon, although Karp had guessed about satellites after seeing the ""quickly moving stars"".

When Dimitry reached manhood he would hunt for days at a time, barefoot in the Siberian winter. Without guns or bows he would simply chase his prey across the mountains until it died from exhaustion, before carrying the carcass home on his shoulders. Akulina had died of starvation in 1961 when a late snow killed all their crops. The rest of the family were saved after a single grain of Rye sprouted in their pea patch - they carefully guarded the plant until they could harvest 18 grains form it allowing them to slowly rebuild their crop.

As the family came to know and trust the scientists at first the only gift they would accept was salt - Karp, then in his 80s, said living without it had been ""true torture"". But their interactions with the modern world would have a tragic impact on the isolated family. In 1981 three of the four children died, two from kidney failure possibly due to their harsh diet, and Dimitry of pneumonia, which might have begun as an infection caught from the outsiders.

Neither Karp or daughter Agafia would leave their remote home, despite offers to reunite them with their old village, and Karp died there in 1988. Agafia stayed on alone, saying that the Lord would provide. Now in her seventies, Afagia still lives there, alone in the wilderness she has known her whole life.

Although Campi Flegrei last erupted almost 500 years ago, a spate of recent earthquakes has left scientists concerned another catastrophe could be imminent

An Italian supervolcano which last erupted in 1538 is 'on the brink' of doing so again sparking fears of a global winter, scientists say.

According to research published in the journal, Communications Earth & Environment, the crust of Campi Flegrei is weakening and more prone to rupturing making an ""eruption more likely"".

Situated near Naples in the south of the country, Campi Flegrei (or Burning Fields, in Greek), is a broad region of supervolcanic calderas - a large depression which forms after a volcano erupts and collapses.

Should it erupt in a similar fashion to that 16th century occasion, molten rock and volcanic gases would be launched high into the stratosphere and lead to 100-feet high tsunamis.

It would also result in the spread of sulfur and toxic ash, potentially plunging the planet into a lengthy global winter, killing wildlife and crops in its wake.

Despite the site being inactive for such a long period of time, a recent rise in the number of earthquakes in the area - more than 600 in April alone - has left scientists gravely concerned.

Those concerns are mirrored by the half a million residents living in the vicinity and deemed most at risk. An evacuation plan is in place, which would see people moved away within three days, either by their own transport or buses, trains and boats.

Risk levels, which are regularly reviewed, are graded by colour - green, yellow, orange and red. Pozzuoli, which is home to a large proportion of those 500,000 residents, is currently on yellow alert.

Local man Francesco Cammarota told the Guardian: ""Some days there are more than one. It's frightening, especially at night. One day it will just go off.""

Discussing the study, which was carried out by experts at Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) and University College London (UCL), lead author Professor Christopher Kilburn (UCL Earth Sciences) revealed: ""Our new study confirms that Campi Flegrei is moving closer to rupture.""

Since the eruption almost 500 years ago, the area has been gently sinking due to rising magma pushing the ground above it up, with Pozzuoli lifted almost four metres in the last 70 years.

Mauro Antonio Di Vito, director of the INGV's nearby Vesuvius Observatory, said the dense population of the area presents a high risk as there would be a struggle to evacuate people through the narrow streets.

He added: ""These areas have been urbanised without considering the fragility. Buildings need to be better structured and we need a cultural change to really encourage people to do this.""

Scientists are optimistically cautious, however, that a huge scale eruption isn't necessarily inevitable. For that to happen gases would need build up faster than they can escape, whilst magma would need to be able to move at rapid speed through the crust where a crack has formed.

The Observatory's researcher, Stefano Carlino, explained: ""It's the same for all volcanoes that have been quiet for generations. Campi Flegrei may settle into a new routine of gently rising and subsiding, as seen at similar volcanoes around the world, or simply return to rest.

""We can't yet say for sure what will happen. The important point is to be prepared for all outcomes.""

Gigi Hadid has shared a rare but sweet glimpse into her daughter, Khai, humble and peaceful life on their family farm in Pennsylvania after admitting that she loves being a young mum

Gigi Hadid has offered her Instagram followers a rare glimpse into the life of her daughter Khai as she shared a series of snaps depicting their summer day together.

In the pictures, Khai, who is the daughter of the model and her former partner Zayn Malik, can only be seen from her neck downwards or in images from behind. The snaps show her long flowing brunette locks and adorable summer dresses. In another image, her jeans, completed with a smiley face sticker, were tucked into a pair of tiny wellington boots, finished with a bow on the caps.

Gigi showed off her stunning model physique in one of the uploads as she held onto a bowl of vegetables and smiled at the camera, seemingly proud of her crops. At the end of their day on the farm, Gigi and Khai snuggled up in multi-coloured dressing gown, holding an ice cream each.

Khai is rarely seen on Gigi and Zayn's social media accounts, with the co-parents opting to keep their child's life private from their fame-filled lives in the spotlight. Having caught a glimpse of the two-year-old, fans took to the comments to gush over how big the youngest has got.

""SHE'S SO BIG ALREADY?? HER HAIR???"" one excitedly wrote. A second added: ""Khai is growing so fast!""

A third typed: ""Can't believe how big she is! Feels like she was born yesterday,"" while close pal and reality TV star Kylie Jenner simply wrote: ""The life.""

The rare insight into Khai's life comes after Gigi opened up about feeling grateful to be a young mother, admitting that she felt like it was a ""blessing.""

""I've always been quite organized, so having Khai at the time that I did was a blessing. I'm so glad to be a young mom,'"" she told the Sunday Times. ""She's clearly a child who was grown in my stomach eating a lot of British food ""” breakfast, beans, curries. And she still eats like that. She even says some words with a little [English] accent, which I love.""

Asda customer and self-professed 'nerd' Julie McHamish checked her shopping list from the same week a year ago to compare the prices and was stunned to see how much inflation had hit

A savvy shopper says she couldn't believe her eyes after compiling a list of Asda items to see how much they'd been hit by inflation.

Julie McHamish put together a spreadsheet documenting how much her shopping list cost from the supermarket this week compared with this time last year, and was left speechless.

Some store cupboard staples have nearly doubled in price in just 12 months, Julie has revealed, while almost every item on her shopping list bar two things had gone up in price.

The price tag on olive oil has soared by 70%, closely followed by pitted black olives which were up by two thirds (67%) of the original cost.

Recent heatwaves in Spain, which produces roughly half of the world's olive oil, has hit crops hard, driving up prices of the essential ingredient.

Cucumber prices were also up by 67%, Julie found, while other items also seeing big hikes in cost over the past year included cheese (60%), houmous (55%) and semi-skimmed milk (43%).

Bread and potatoes were also up by 40% and 36% respectively.

Sharing her shock on Twitter, Julie wrote: ""Because I am nerdy, I looked back at my online shopping order [at] ASDA a year ago to compare to today's prices. WOW!""

She added: ""Almost all items are over 10% more expensive than last year! Kellogg's Cornflakes are just[!] 5% higher & Maryland Cookies are the same price!""

Alcohol-free Guinness and Maryland cookies were the only two items on Julie's list which were the same price as the year before, although she added the cookies were ""probably more than likely overpriced to begin with"".

She added: ""Surprised that nearly everything was above 10% though!""

Julie's findings, which were examined 12 months apart between March 24 last year and March 23 this year, come as recent Office of National Statistics data revealed inflation rose by 10.1% in the year leading up to January 2023.

The Ukraine war, surging global energy costs and Brexit have all been attributed as reasons for soaring costs in the UK.

Olive oil, skimmed milk and sugar are among the items ONS highlighted as having risen the most.

An ASDA spokesman said: ""All supermarkets have been impacted by global inflationary pressures which has increased the price of key ingredients.

""We're working hard to keep prices in check for customers and we remain the lowest-priced major supermarket - a position recognised by Which? in their regular monthly basket comparison, naming Asda as the cheapest supermarket for a big shop every month for the last three years.

""We recently announced we would be freezing the prices of over 500 popular branded and own label products, more than half of which are fresh meat, dairy, fruit and vegetable products until the end of May.""

Clarkson's Farm Kaleb Cooper congratulated his co-star Charlie Ireland after the land agent completed an impressive challenge

Charlie Ireland was praised by his Clarkson's Farm co-star Kaleb Cooper after completing the inaugural Rob Burrow Leeds Marathon on Sunday, to raise funds for Motor Neurone Disease research.

The advisor and land agent took to Instagram to thank those who supported him, with Kaleb praising Charlie before adding a cheeky comment about the work ahead on Jeremy Clarkson's Farm.

Charlie, whose dad was diagnosed with MND in 2008, wrote: ""Thank you to everyone who has donated to such a great cause @mndassoc Well done to everyone who ran the Rob Burrow Leeds marathon today, what an amazing experience! Here are a few clips from today! #robburrowleedsmarathon #runcheerfulcharlie #motorneuronedisease.""

""Well done don't forget we are walking crops tomorrow! Hope they legs have got it in them,"" Kaleb commented.

Fans shared their support for the Clarkson's Farm star as one wrote: ""Is there anything that this gentleman can't do? Great job, Charlie! Cheers,"" while another added: ""Amazing effort Charlie!! (hope you can still walk today?!).""

A fellow marathon runner said: ""That was a really tough run yesterday! Well done! (My legs are wrecked!!)""

Land agent and agricultural advisor Charlie, says: ""I'm not sure I really thought this through for my first (and only) marathon - Leeds is horribly hilly it seems - but I am looking forward to the challenge. My Dad was diagnosed with MND in 2008 and the MND Association were amazing.

""Our family met some incredible people who showed so much warmth and kindness which made Dad's life far easier. There is no known cure, but the funds raised will help families like ours to cope a little easier by getting the support they need from the MND Association. It will also enable further research into this terrible disease.""

Meanwhile, Clarkson's Farm stars Kaleb and Charlie visited Downing Street on Tuesday for a summit hosted by Rishi Sunak on securing supermarket supply chains.

Asked about the stars' attendance at the Farm to Fork meeting, the Prime Minister's spokesman told journalists: ""Obviously that programme (Clarkson's Farm) has been important in raising some of the issues that farmers face.

""And I think some of the policies set out today will support the farming sector.""

Emma Rose Lowry was bitten by a tomcat beetle and suffered blisters, which turned to scarring, on her leg. She now wants holidaymakers to be aware of the insects when visiting Bali

A woman has issued a desperate warning to travellers visiting Bali after a ""very venomous"" bug left her leg covered in blisters and bruises.

Emma Rose Lowry, from Victoria in southeast Australia, was on holiday in Indonesia when the incident happened. She was visiting the resort town of Kuta when the bug, which she described as ""small and similar to a bull ant"", walked over her body during dinner.

The insect, later identified as a rover beetle, also known as tomcat beetle, has a toxic venom that causes paederus dermatitis - a severe type of skin irritation. These bugs live in moist habitats such as crops, riverbanks and marshes, and are prominent in Balinese rice paddies.

The 28-year-old said she did not even notice the insect at first but became concerned when she noticed a five-centimetre-long blister on her leg the next morning. And just one day later, she said the blister ""burst"", with the redness spreading further across her body.

By the third day, her bruises began to deepen and spread even further - and at that time, she also developed flu-like symptoms including hot and cold flushes as well as swollen lymph nodes. She told Yahoo News Australia: ""It happened about two days before I was coming home. I googled it and was thinking: 'What the hell is this?'

""So, I got it looked at in Australia at my GP and all the GPs had never ever heard of that. All the pharmacies said they'd never heard of it, they were like bringing people over to look at it."" She said eventually she found out the blister was caused by the beetle, and required a round of antibiotics.

Despite suffering a number of symptoms, the woman feels lucky because others develop even worse reactions, including vomiting. But she said: ""The scars are full on."" As she loves Bali, Ms Lowry said she does not want to deter people from travelling to the popular holiday destination, but added they should be aware of the beetles, and checking the bottom of chairs in places like restaurants to ensure the area is clear.

To prevent tomcat burns, you can also try to use insect repellents, wear protective clothes, avoid using strongly scented products such as perfumes, and plan your activities carefully as these bugs are more active during dawn and dusk. If you experience symptoms of a tomcat burn, you should seek medical attention.

The most common treatments include cleaning the affected area, applying a cool compress, and taking pain relief medication or antibiotics. In more severe cases, a doctor may also prescribe corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, or antihistamines to reduce itching and swelling. Topical treatments such as aloe vera or hydrocortisone cream may be recommended too to soothe the skin and reduce inflammation.

The huge shipment of cocaine was found in 77 plastic bags on a semi-submersible vessel in the Pacific Ocean, with the cargo reportedly intercepted while being transported to Central America.

A massive cocaine shipment worth nearly $1 million (£786,880) was seized by the Colombian military from a semi-submersible vessel.

The vessel was loaded with an eye-watering 1,640 kilos of cocaine when it was spotted off the coast of the western province of NariÃ±o, in the Pacific Ocean, according to Armed Forces Commander General Helder Giraldo. At the time, four suspects were arrested.

The shipment was reportedly being sent to Central America, and was stuffed inside 77 plastic bags. The coast guard escorted the vessel to its port in the NariÃ±o town of Tumaco, where agents with the prosecutor's office inspected the cargo and confirmed it was cocaine.

Suspects are facing trafficking, manufacturing and possession of drug charges, and could serve prison sentences ranging from eight to 20 years if they are found guilty. The military said that authorities have confiscated more than 705,000 kilos of cocaine from drug trafficking organisations in 2023, with the drugs enough to produce 4 million street sales across the world.

By seizing cocaine shipments they have prevented the cartels and left-wing guerrillas from making over $56 million in sales, the military also said. In Colombia, crops of cocaine's main ingredient - coca - rose 13 per cent last year to hit a record 568,342 acres.

Cocaine is no unknown drug in the UK. Mirror Online previously reported that Britain is now the biggest market place in Europe for secret online cocaine dealing. The country also accounts for a third of the £733million worth of the drug sold each year worldwide on the dark web.

The Daily Mail reported that potential cocaine production increased by 24 percent to 1,915 tons per year, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Colombian authorities said in November they hoped to destroy 77 square miles of coca crops by the end of the year and seize a record 834 tons of cocaine.

And the National Crime Agency estimates a huge chunk of the UK's £244million cocaine industry conducted on the internet's sinister underworld is bought by users here. More and more tech-savvy ­children and teenagers are being drawn into the dark web's world because it offers them a ""Harry Potter style invisibility cloak"" in their search for drugs.

The NCA confirmed there were ""more customers for cocaine in the UK so more is supplied"".And the biggest dealers in Britain can rake in up to £80million a year, shipping cocaine to buyers Amazon-style - with same-day deliveries from dark web shopping sites hidden from mainstream internet users.

The seemingly ordinary patch of land, known as Observer Post Field, on the edge of a village in Bolsover, Derbyshire, hides an impressive Cold War secret that could be yours, if you have a spare £70,000 lying around

This perfectly normal-looking piece of farmland hides an impressive Cold War secret that could be yours, if you have a spare £70,000 lying around.

The seemingly ordinary patch of land, known as Observer Post Field, on the edge of a village in Bolsover, Derbyshire, is used by its current owner to grow crops but it is now up for sale for £350,000.

The aptly-named field is home to a shrub-covered abandoned Cold War bunker, listed as part of the price tag - or available separately.

The land, near the village of Whitwell, is split into two lots with the first, valued at £280,000 and 21.55 acres in size being the area largely used to grow crops. The second, valued at £70,000, comprises a 4.61 acre lot that includes the mysterious shelter, possibly built in the 1960s.

The bunker, which has been sealed off, has been registered as a monument by the local County Council, DerbyshireLive reports.

The authority's website states: ""This site has been utilised over the past century and a half for its good vantage point. According to the Whitwell Local History Group, it was used as an observation point by the Royal Observer Corps from 1939 onwards and was manned every day during World War Two for this purpose.

""An underground shelter was built on the site, possibly in the 1970s, in the event of a nuclear attack. Inside the shelter are two rooms: a communal area and a w/c. (1) A total of 870 thermo-nuclear fallout shelters and observation posts were built throughout the country by the Home Office as part of a strategic defence against nuclear attack.

""Measuring 18ft by 10ft, the bunkers were buried 12ft underground, were built of reinforced concrete and cost £2,000 each. The shelters were decommissioned in 1992 when the then Home Secretary decided they were no longer necessary.""

Now, agents from W.T. Parker estate agents, based in Chesterfield, say the surrounding land ""could be used for other agricultural/equestrian type uses subject to planning consent being obtained.""

Rory McIlroy's most recent major triumph came at the USPGA Championship at Valhalla in 2014 - but the golf hero is determined to win a fifth major as soon as possible

Rory McIlroy believes he's on the cusp of ending his nine-year major drought after coming up just short at the US Open.

McIlroy finished one shot behind winner Wyndham Clark in Los Angeles, with the American claiming a surprise victory. Clark was not expected to challenge before the tournament but held a share of the lead with Rickie Fowler heading into Sunday's round.

As Fowler's challenge collapsed, Clark held his nerve to keep McIlroy at bay. It was a frustrating result for the latter, who is waiting for his fifth major title. McIlroy keeps coming up just short, recording 19 top 10 finishes at majors since his last triumph in 2014.

That frustrating run includes three second-place finishes, including two in the last two years. Yet McIlroy is keeping the faith. He believes he will win another major sooner rather than later if he can keep putting himself in these good positions.

When asked for his verdict on his US Open campaign, a shattered McIlroy said: ""I'm right there, it's such fine margins.""

Clark posted a level-par 70 on the final day to claim his first major on 10 under. Scottie Scheffler (-7) finished third, with Cameron Smith (-6) in fourth. Clark said: ""US Opens are tough. I felt at ease though and kept saying to myself, 'I can do this, I can do this'.""

When do you think Rory McIlroy will win his next major title? Let us know in the comments below!

McIlroy is one of the best golfers of his generation and has major pedigree after winning the 2011 US Open, 2014 Open and two USPGA Championships. Yet his nine-year wait for a fifth crown is a talking point that crops up at every major event.

""I have just got to keep putting myself in these positions,"" claimed McIlroy. ""Sooner or later it's going to happen for me.""

Reflecting on his final round 70, McIlroy added: ""There are a couple of things I will rue. The chip on 14 being one. It was really hard to get the ball close, but I hung in there and just didn't quite get the job done. I will keep coming back until I get another one.""

McIlroy's final chance to win a major this year is the Open, which takes place at Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Hoylake. He won the prestigious competition when it was last held at the Merseyside course in 2014, giving fans hope of a belated major triumph.

An emotional Clark, meanwhile, insisted it was ""my time"" to win a major and paid tribute to his late mother Lise, who died of breast cancer in 2013. This is the 29-year-old's second win on the PGA Tour, with his first coming at last month's Wells Fargo Championship.

Clark said: ""I just felt like my mom was watching over me. I just feel like it was my time. I have dreamed of this moment for so long and there are so many times I have visualised being here in front of you guys and winning this championship.""

176,"Worldwide plastic waste has doubled since 2000 - and working animals are suffering","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/working-animals-health-plastic-waste-30230212","Worldwide plastic waste has doubled since 2000 - and working animals are suffering

Heartbreaking new footage shows working donkeys, camels, and cows left to scavenge for food among mountains of plastic waste - with life-threatening results

Worldwide plastic waste has more than doubled since 2000, figures show - but two-thirds of Brits (67 per cent) are unaware of the impact this is having on working animals overseas.

With an estimated 200 million animals working globally - including camels, horses, donkeys, oxen, mules, and even elephants - they are now more at risk than ever of catching a potentially fatal condition from dumped plastic waste.

These livestock are already faced with harsh conditions, in 40°C temperatures in countries like India and Mali, helping their owners transport water and goods for a small income - and even occasionally travelling to dumps, carrying the plastic waste that is threatening their welfare.

And ahead of International Working Animal Day on June 15, this heartbreaking footage has been released showing the animals scavenging for food among heaps of plastic and other waste.

The footage, from rubbish dumps in Mali, India, and Morocco, shows struggling donkeys almost buckling under the weight of the carts they are transporting - before sniffing around among huge mounds of black bin bags and other plastic, trying to find sustenance.

By accidentally ingesting plastic, these animals face severe health risks from internal blockages, and life-threatening conditions such as colic.

But with the global cost-of-living crisis, paired with growing global inequality, making it harder for owners to buy food for their animals, sadly these working animals are faced with little other choice.

The footage was released by working animal charity SPANA (the Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad), which also commissioned research of 2,000 British adults to highlight the lack of awareness about this growing global issue.

The study found that more than seven in ten Brits (71 per cent) are unaware that plastic pollution can have fatal consequences, affecting thousands of innocent animals.

However, 79 per cent said they now feel motivated to reduce how much plastic waste they personally generate, to help alleviate the plight of working animals.

Linda Edwards, Chief Executive of SPANA, which is raising awareness about the problem of plastic pollution this International Working Animal Day, said: ""Working animals have a critical role supporting families in vulnerable communities - but our research shows there is very little awareness about the deadly impact plastic waste has on these animals.

""We are making a lifesaving difference to working animals under severe threat from plastic pollution, by providing vital veterinary treatment and supporting owners with information and guidance on the dangers of plastic waste to their animals.""

The poll of 2,000 adults also found more than three-quarters (76 per cent) would like society to move towards a zero plastic or waste future, to prevent the harm caused to working animals.

Data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development shows 353 million tonnes of plastic waste were generated globally in 2019 - and only nine per cent of plastic waste is recycled.

Worldwide, the amount of plastic waste generated more than doubled from 2000 to 2019, with mismanaged waste - plastic that is either littered, or not disposed of properly - now a huge problem.

While the UK is estimated to produce just under 0.5kg of mismanaged plastic waste per person, Zimbabwe generates 36kg, Tanzania creates 30kg, and Tunisia 25kg by comparison.

Overall, just one in 20 of the adults polled (five per cent) claim to be very knowledgeable about the lives of working animals in low-income countries.

And the vast majority (82 per cent) had no idea about the 2022 UN Nexus Resolution - which recognises the interdependence between animal welfare, the environment, and sustainable development.

Last year, SPANA provided vital care and support to 306,412 working animals across the world - including in Mali, at the rubbish dumps seen in the video.

Colic - a life-threatening condition, which can be caused by eating plastic and foreign objects - is one of the most common problems treated by SPANA's veterinary teams.

In some parts of Morocco, where SPANA works, colic ranks as the second most common problem treated by the charity's vets, after lameness.

Without treatment, working horses, donkeys, and mules can have little chance of surviving colic.

Linda Edwards added: ""Sadly, many working animals in low-income countries live very difficult lives, working in extreme conditions and suffering from poor welfare.

""That is why SPANA's work is so important - offering a lifeline to working animals in desperate need, and transforming their welfare.

""We are providing training in animal care in owners, and bringing about long-term, lasting change through our animal welfare classes for children.

""Plastic pollution is one of the many environmental threats facing working animals, alongside climate change, drought, cyclones, and flooding.

""However, the deadly impact these issues have on working animals is often overlooked. Working animals can no longer be ignored - and it's critical that they receive the recognition and urgent help they need.""

Elisa Lanzai, 16, was forced to desperately cling on and scream for help as three English Bull Terriers ""appeared from nowhere"" and started biting her horse's nose and legs

A teenager was left screaming in terror after a pack of out-of-control English Bull Terriers attacked her horse at a Scottish country park.

Elisa Lanzai, 16, was out riding with Smithy at Mugdock Country Park, near Glasgow, when the three dogs ""appeared from nowhere"" and started biting her horse's nose and legs. The schoolgirl was forced to desperately cling on as Smithy started bucking and rearing in an attempt to escape.

The owners eventually caught up, but were said to have no leashes for their pets and had to drag them away by their collars. Elisa's mum, Eilidh, is now calling for others to ensure they have their dogs under control around horses and livestock.

The 45-year-old, from Milngavie, told the Daily Record: ""Elisa was riding over a bridge at the park and out of nowhere three dogs came running towards them. When Smithy saw them coming, he turned round and ran across the bridge but the three dogs surrounded him.

""That's when Smithy began bucking and rearing. Elisa was screaming: 'Recall your dogs, they're attacking, they're attacking!' but they were nowhere to be seen."" She claimed that the dog owners refused to give their names or details after the frightening incident on October 1.

Eilidh continued: ""They didn't once ask them to come back and there was no apology, they just got their dogs and left."" Pictures show the horse's bridle broken at the neckpiece with chunks taken out of the straps of leather after the attack.

The mum-of-two added: ""Elisa escaped with a sore throat from screaming and painful muscles. She is lucky she wasn't thrown off the horse. There are bite marks all over Smithy's bridal and the nose band has snapped. To be able to break a bridal takes a massive amount of force.""

Eilidh hopes sharing her daughter's story will encourage other dog owners to be more responsible and keep their pets on a leash. She said: ""It was a scary incident for Elisa, dogs have predatory instincts so it can be really dangerous if your dog is off a leash.

""I would like people to understand that no matter how well trained or socialised your dog is, they can be unpredictable."" scotland>Police Scotland confirmed they had received a report about the matter. A force spokesperson said: ""This incident was reported to police and officers issued suitable advice.""

Kenzie Kizer was in her garden in doing some weeding in Texas, US, when she suddenly felt like her arms were on fire after coming into contact with poison hemlock

A woman's tongue swelled and her speech slurred after she unknowingly came across a poison plant.

Kenzie Kizer, from Texas, US, was undertaking some routine garden maintenance when she suddenly felt her arms were on fire.

Ms Kizer said her first symptoms started after she finished weeding, which caused her to have terrible sensations on her arms.

Her tongue began to swell, she felt dizzy and her speech became slurred after coming into contact with poison hemlock.

The poisonous plant, which is commonly found in creeks and bottomlands, has tiny white flowers which can prove fatal to humans, dogs and livestock.

According to experts at Texas A & M University, poison hemlock can appear in southern Texas roadside ditches and along the banks of streams.

She has since set-up a Facebook to warn others of the dangers of the plant.

""I took a shower to wash out what I believed to be splinters,"" Ms Kizer wrote.

""Less than an hour later my tongue started swelling, my skin was burning, my speech was slurred, I was dizzy, confused and very shaky.

""It started to feel as though my chest was tightening and I was struggling to breathe.""

As the symptoms started to escalate, she headed to her nearest hospital where medics confirmed she had been in contact with poison hemlock.

Doctors said she saved her life by showering as this helped mitigate the plant's poison.

On Facebook, she has continued to warn others of the dangers of the plant.

Angie Rodriguez, who is on the Facebook page, commented she also had similar symptoms to Kenzie after she encountered the plant while in a creek.

She and her 11-year-old were playing on a swing when her hands started to swell and her skin became incredibly itchy.

She wrote: ""Ten mintues after we came inside, my son came to me saying his skin was burning pretty bad. I noticed he had a rash all over his body. Not long after, my throat felt as if it was closing and made it hard to swallow.

""Last two days I've had my eyes watery and super irritated, face swollen, no taste in my mouth, hot sweats, short of breath, nauseated, and what to me felt like flu.""

Angie revealed she has since made a recovery and warned others ""this weed is no joke, please be careful.""

Hemlock - what to look out for

According to Healthline, poison hemlock can grow throughout the year, but it is normally found in the spring.

The stem of a hemlock has purple spots and the plant can grow up to nine feet tall.

The roots of poison hemlock can easily be mistaken for wild parsnips, while the leaves can be mistaken for parsley, and this is the primary reason for accidental poisoning.

Poison hemlock is often found on roadsides, in waste areas and near fences.

Experts say people should be cautious when attempting to remove the poisonous plant as cutting or moving it can release more of its dangerous fumes.

In order to get rid of the plant, the hemlock should be dug from the ground or herbicides should be sprayed if the plant is not yet sprouting flowers.

In addition, protective clothing such as gloves and face masks should also be worn when handling poison hemlock.

Common symptoms of hemlock poisoning may include: trembling, burning in the digestive tract, increased salivation, dilated pupils, muscle pain, muscle weakness or muscle paralysis, rapid heart rate followed by a decreased heart rate, loss of speech, convulsions, unconsciousness or coma.

Locals on a UK island have called for tourists to stop 'vandalising' the landscape in a bid to make their mark after a visit - and using ancient rituals as an excuse

Tourists are ""vandalising"" the beautiful landscape of a Scottish island by making Pagan labyrinths out of stones,

The sacred Inner Hebrides island of Iona is a magnet for Christian and Pagan tourists interested in the origins of Christianity in Scotland dating back to 563AD.

Mysterious labyrinth patterns measuring 10m across have appeared in recent years, which are regularly dismantled by islanders who graze livestock there.

Former islander Iain Cameron, 50, visited earlier this week and was appalled to see one large stone formation and the beginnings of another.

The malt whisky company worker, who lives near Stirling, said the age-old concept of 'leave no trace' appears to have gone, and visitors are now determined to put their stamp on the landscape.

The majority of Iona is owned by the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) but Iain said he doubted signs would deter Instagram-obsessed tourists.

Iain said: ""The labyrinths are semi-permanent. They have been there for a number of years, there are periodic attempts to clear them but they tend to come back.

""Locals told me they are tired of clearing piles of stones, it has become almost part of the landscape. It's a form of vandalism.

""People seem to be unable to go and absorb their surroundings without leaving a fingerprint that they were there. It's like the Fairy Pools on Skye, the locals go and routinely dismantle piles of stones.

""It's a trend that seems to be increasing. NTS don't own all of Iona but I think it would be futile if they put up signs.

""If the locals didn't dismantle them the whole bay would be full of manmade structures. That area is where cattle and sheep graze, it's impacting the landscape and the livestock.

""We should be trying to make 'leave no trace' popular again in the Instagram age. Iona attracts people searching for spiritual nourishment.""

Iain claimed that the labyrinths were being built by Pagans, who see it as an ancient symbol of wholeness, with the circle and spiral combining into a meandering but purposeful journey.

""When people go down there they are completing some form of pilgrimage,"" Iain continued. ""St Columba's Bay is the end of the pilgrimage, I think that's why the labyrinth keeps coming back again.""

Last year hikers were urged to avoid taking part in an old tradition. For hundreds of years people soaking up the fields and glens of the four nations have marked their long walks and climbs with a tower of rocks.

Rock stacks, or cairns, can be found on many of the highest peaks in the country and form impromptu, often elegant sculptures.

While the art, which is often referred to as ""stone balancing"" or ""prayer stone stacks"", is ancient, it has become a more popular activity in the past decade or so. As lovely as these may be to stumble across, the practice is rife with controversy.

Many people find it troubling to discover a human made monument while out on a remote walk, feeling that it removes some of the sense of wildness from the natural landscape.

""Almost every beach we visited in Orkney was spoiled by people leaving their mark and for a photo for social media,"" the Blue Planet Society recently tweeted. ""It's a worrying trend. It ruins the scenery and the environment.""

Environmental campaigners also argue that moving rocks from where they're settled on a beach or hillside can have a massive ecological effect. Birds such as oyster catchers build small nest on the rocks, which are very difficult to see but easy to destroy if you're not careful.

Rumours of a large feline lurking in the Ceredigion area of Wales emerged as far back as the 1970s when a series of sheep were found eaten

A mystery big cat known as 'The Beast of Bont' is alive and stalking the British hills and feeding off sheep, with locals descending into panic.

Farmers say numerous flocks are being regularly killed by a ''bloody big' feline - and have even called in the police.

It's thought the beast was first spotted back in the 1970s, luring in the Ceredigion area of Wales, when a series of sheep were found eaten.

There have been numerous cases since including the killing of 12 sheep in 1981 in the village of 'Bont' - giving the beast its name - and the slaughter of 20 in 2012.

One local farmer Suzanne Hill says last weekend spotted a mystery beast near her home in Penuwch - which she says may have been a puma or another big cat.

Suzanne said: ""I was washing up and looking out of my kitchen window, and I thought to myself, ""˜that's a bloody big cat'.

""It played on my mind, and I thought about it and looked at the perspective, and I realised I shouldn't have been able to see a cat all that distance away with such clarity.

""It was unmistakably feline, jet black and it had a long black tail carried out the back. It was about the height of a Labrador - but much longer.

""I posted about it on Facebook with a picture of a panther from Google, and I didn't expect the response I got - I expected to be ridiculed.

""I didn't expect the depth of belief, the examples, the stories, the recollections of dates and places and people and names.

""We could be talking about a new indigenous species. The wild cats of Wales.""

Ceredigion farmer Jonathan Davies also recently discovered that several of his sheep had been 'skinned' by an unknown animal.

Jonathan contacted Dyfed-Powys Police in February after several of his sheep were brutally killed at his farm in Ponterwyd.

He claims that a police officer told him that it was probably a 'big cat' that winters in Carmarthenshire's Brechfa Forest, before migrating to Myherin Forest in the mountains for the summer.

The officer allegedly blamed the issue on 'discarded pets' abandoned by owners during the 1970's before the Dangerous Wild Animals Act was passed in 1976.

Jonathan said: ""I phoned a few farmers and a friend in Devil's Bridge, and she said she'd been having trouble for about 15 years. She said she loses about six sheep a year.

""She had inspectors at her farm, looking at these carcasses, and they told her it was a cat.

""She told me to call the police and report it, so when I called up, I said to the policewoman, ""˜you're going to think I've lost the plot here'.

""But she said I can see it all on the log that there are loads of reports and it's always happening.

""She told me a woman in Carmarthen had lost eight (sheep) in the space of a week - and she had put remote cameras up to try and catch a glimpse of it.

""I'd heard the stories all my life and I thought people were bloody crazy, or they'd seen a large house­cat running across the field and had come up with a ridiculous story.

""But after my sheep were killed, I believe them.""

Local organization 'Puma Watch' claims to have had 50 sightings since March 2020.

The UK Ministry of Agriculture in the 1980s concluded that whatever killed the sheep 'must have been a great deal more powerful than a fox or a dog'.

Despite the claims, Dyfed-Powys Police deny the existence of any 'big cat sighting' log - though have previously issued some guidance and are appealing for the public to photograph it and report sightings.

A spokesperson for the force said: ""We wouldn't be able to confirm any suspected big cat sightings at this time.

""We don't have anyone specifically trained in shooting big cats, however, our firearms officers are trained in animal destruction for animals that are suffering or dangerously out of control.

""Where sightings of suspected big cats are received these are then reported by the police to the Welsh Government.""

A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""There is no requirement to inform the Welsh Government, however, any report received from the public of alleged sightings of, and alleged attacks by, big cats on livestock in Wales are investigated.

""Any threat to human life is the responsibility of the Home Office and such concerns should be referred to the police.

""All reported sightings and incidents are taken seriously and investigated thoroughly but no hard evidence has been discovered proving the existence of big cats in the Welsh countryside.

""Most attacks on livestock are carried out by native predators such as foxes, or by dogs.""

181,"Bobi the farm dog breaks world record as oldest pooch to ever exist at 30 years old","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/bobi-farm-dog-breaks-world-29114490","Bobi the farm dog breaks world record as oldest pooch to ever exist at 30 years old

Farm dog Bobi has been crowned the world's oldest living pooch to ever exist, after celebrating his 30th birthday with the Costa family in Leiria, Portugal, last year

The record for the world's oldest living dog has just been beaten by Bobi the OAP pooch - and he's also the oldest verified dog in history. Bobi, who was born on 11 May 1992, is 30 years 267 days old - beating chihuahua Spike who was announced the eldest just two weeks ago.

Bobi is a purebred Rafeiro do Alentejo, a breed of livestock guardian dog, and has miraculously doubled the average life expectancy of 12-14 years. According to the Guinness World Records, Bobi has lived his entire life with the Costa family in the rural village of Conqueiros, in Leiria, Portugal.

Australian cattle dog Bluey was previously the oldest dog to ever exist, and lived to be 29 years and five months old.

Bobi's birth date and age has been verified by SIAC, a Portuguese pet database, and the Veterinary Medical Service of the Municipality of Leiria.

His owner Leonel Costa, 38, says Bobi was born as one of four male pups to mother Gira in an outbuilding where the Costa family stored wood.

Tragically, Leonel's father decided that they couldn't keep the newborn puppies and planned to bury the animals in a hole so they wouldn't survive.

But he somehow left behind little Bobi and when Leonel and his brothers spotted the miraculous pup in the garden, they kept his existence a secret.

""We knew that when the dog opened its eyes, my parents would no longer bury it. It was popular knowledge that this act could not or should be done,"" Leonel explained.

It usually takes one to two weeks for newborn puppies to open their eyes, and when Leonel's parents eventually discovered Bobi, it was too late.

Leonel said they were punished but it was ""worth it"" and loved growing up with little Bobi on the farm.

He describes Bobi as very sociable and says he loves eating ""human food"" - which he believes contributed to his longevity.

""Between a can of animal food or a piece of meat, Bobi doesn't hesitate and chooses our food,"" he said.

Leonel also thinks one of the biggest contributing factors is the ""calm, peaceful environment"" away from the city.

Bobi has never been chained up nor attached to a leash, and has always enjoyed roaming the farmland.

As he's got older, he struggles to walk as much and his eyesight has worsened, meaning he often bumps into things.

The OAP now enjoys more naps and will be found relaxing by the fire on a colder day.

But health wise, he's lived a relatively trouble-free life and only gave Leonel ""one big scare"" in 2018 when he was hospitalised with breathing problems.

Bobi's mother Gira lived to the age of 18 and one of the family's other dogs Chicote lived to be 22.

So it's not unusual for the Costa family to have a pet's company for such a long while.

""I never thought of registering Bobi to break the record because fortunately our animals have always lasted for many years,"" Leonel explained.

Though he says Bobi is ""one of a kind"" and the ""last of a long generation of animals"".

In May, Bobi will celebrate his 31st birthday, though it's likely he'll be oblivious to the fact he's made history as the oldest dog to ever exist.

A group of researchers have analysed 11,000 dogs across 300 breeds to come up with a list that reveals which types of pooches are the most and least friendly in the world

We all know that dogs are supposed to be a 'man's best friend' - but is that true of all breeds?

We'd all like to think to think that our furry friend is the best in the world - but truth be told there are some dogs that are less friendly than others. Some experts believe it has a lot to do with which breed they are.

A study has gone out to set the record straight, to find out which are the friendliest dog breeds, and those that are the least. So it turns out that when it comes to being sociable with humans, not every dog is equal.

Researchers at the University of Helsinki in Finland have revealed a list of the dog breeds with the highest and lowest levels of human sociability, and some may surprise you.

Their research shows that bull type terriers, such as the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, is officially man's best friend, closely followed by teacup dogs and golden retrievers.

On the flip side, the least friendly dog types are livestock guardian dogs, Asian primitive breeds, and primitive sighthounds. The full list can be seen below.

Most friendly dog breeds:

Least friendly dog breeds:

The researchers set out to investigate the personality differences between the dogs by analysing 11,000 pooches across 300 breeds, which were then categorised into 52 groups.

Their data showed that there's a strong link between dog breeds and personality traits such as insecurity, training focus, aggressiveness/dominance, energy, dog sociability, human sociability, and perseverance.

Dr Milla Salonen, the lead author of the study, said: ""The breed of the dog is the most important determinant underlying personality differences.

""All dogs are individuals, and all breeds have different traits, but the breeds differ in what kind of personality most dogs within each breed have.""

In addition to breed, they also found that female dogs scored higher than males. Human sociability also decreased with age.

Dr Salonen said.: ""Our findings indicate that new owners should familiarise their puppies as much as possible with unfamiliar people, places, and animals.

""Of course, socialisation must always be done on the puppy's terms, which means that the puppy must not be forced into frightening situations.""

The original reality show returns to UK screens next month, and hosts AJ Odudu and Will Best say the programme's bosses will be working on one particular area of improvement

New Big Brother hosts AJ Odudu and Will Best insist duty of care for the contestants will be a priority for bosses, ahead of the new series starting next month.

And that is certainly a good thing, given, as they put it, the poor contestants are basically going back into lockdown. Will says TV chiefs have honed their care over 20 years. Producers oversaw Love Island's revamped measures, which were overhauled in the wake of two former contestants' suicides.

""The level of care that the housemates are going to get going into the show, and the aftercare coming out, is unmatched in TV history, basically,"" he says. Will also believes the contestants will be more prepared for life in the house post-pandemic, adding: ""They're going back into lockdown, so they're gonna be fine.""

That duty of care extends to keeping the house free from its original inhabitants: a coup of chickens. AJ reckons producers would not be allowed to have any pets, while Will agrees: ""I think it will be a livestock free house."" But AJ believes the show will return to its humble beginnings in other ways, with rows escalating over the most mundane issues: ""The arguments all start because of the shopping list,"" she laughs to the Dish podcast. Someone's had more cheese...""

The series kicks off on Sunday, October 8, across both ITV1 and ITV2 and will be followed every night by a chat show Big Brother: Late & Live, while ITVX will also screen a live feed from the house. So let's hope there are some interesting moments in the house, or that's a lot of screen time to fill.

Kathy McKellar, 74, had been walking her dog in Grindleton, Lancashire, during a holiday when she was found trampled to death by cows, as her family urged people to be careful

A ""fiercely independent"" mother who loved the outdoors was found trampled to death by a herd of cows as she walked her dog.

Kathy McKellar, 74, had been staying in a holiday cottage in Grindleton, Lancashire, in September last year when she went for a stroll with cockapoo Archie.

Later that day the owner of the cottage, John Turner, found the dog with his lead still attached after he made his way back.

When he was unable to find Kathy, Mr Turner called 999 before going to look for her, Lancslive reported.

The following day farmer David Towler found Kathy's body in a field and she was later pronounced dead at the scene by emergency services.

Speaking at an inquest held today, Kathy's son Andy described his mum as a ""fiercely independent"" woman who loved tennis, walking and baking.

He said: ""She would go on this sort of holiday regularly, she did everything for herself, and she brought up my brother and I pretty much on her own.

""She loved being outside and walking the dog; it was their happy place. Mum grew up in Clitheroe, that's where her family is from, but she moved to Macclesfield when she had me.

""We lost my nan two years ago from old age so mum liked to come back up here to feel more connected to her part of the world.

""Although she was 74 she was still working part-time.""

A post mortem CT scan revealed Kathy died from traumatic chest injuries including fractured vertebrae and ribs.

Mr Towler told proceedings he was checking his animals on the farm when he noticed a bag on the grass which led him to Kathy's body.

He said has not had any issues with any of his cows or bulls being aggressive and would sell any showing unusual behaviours or temperament.

He said: ""They can be quite protective when they have calves but only in the first few weeks; these calves were around five months old.

""We have two sheepdogs and we have sheep grazing with the cows so they're used to my dogs being around.""

The inquest heard there had been a previous incident involving a female walker suffering an injury when she disturbed some sleeping cows in one of Mr Towler's fields in 2018.

In response the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) advised Mr Towler to move the water and feed troughs and put up a warning sign.

HSE inspector Shellie Bee visited Scriddles Croft Farm a few weeks after Kathy's death and noted the warning sign had fallen down.

However, she concluded as Kathy had entered the field via a different gate, she would not have seen the sign even if it had been up.

The investigation concluded Mr Towler had followed all guidance issued to farmers regarding keeping members of the public safe from cattle.

However, because the specific circumstances leading to Kathy's death were not known, Mr Towler was issued with a notice requiring him to fence off the public footpath in this particular field.

The inquest heard that, on average, there is one death a year in the UK relating to a member of the public being trampled by cattle. During 2021 there were five fatalities but this was during Covid lockdown when more people were going out for a walk.

Kathy's son Andy voiced concerns that farmers are only issued guidance by the HSE instead of strict regulations.

He added: ""People have died because they are just guidelines and that doesn't feel good enough.

Guidelines are guidelines; you don't have to follow them and I just don't want to see this happen to anyone else.""

Assistant Coroner Kate Bisset returned a narrative conclusion.

Outside court Kathy's son Andy said he hoped that by raising awareness walkers would be more cautious around livestock and that farmers would ensure the public are protected as best as they can be.

John Price, 68, claimed he bulldozed the trees along the River Lugg near Leominster, Herefordshire, to protect homes from flooding - while National England said it led to a 'devastating' effect on local wildlife

A farmer who hired diggers and builders to illegally rip up trees in a beauty spot has been jailed and ordered to pay £1.2million in restoration costs.

John Price, 68, claimed he bulldozed the trees along the River Lugg near Leominster, Herefordshire, to protect homes from flooding.

He used an 18-tonne digger to dredge a section of the river and stripped a mile-long stretch of the bank of trees in December 2020.

He claimed it was to protect locals in the nearby hamlet whose homes had been devastated by previous floods.

Price was accused in court of damaging a protected Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and one of the UK's most important salmon rivers.

Natural England officials said the river had been ""decimated"" by the work which had led to a ""devastating"" effect on local wildlife and people living nearby.

They said the habitats of ""iconic wildlife"" such as otters, kingfishers and salmon had also been destroyed along the 1.5-kilometre stretch of the river.

Price was found guilty of seven offences relating to breaching a Natural England stop notice at Kidderminster Magistrates' Court.

On Thursday, he was jailed for 12 months and disqualified from being a company director for three years.

The cost of the damage to the River Lugg and the embankments amounts to £600,000, which he must repay in 12 months.

Sentencing, Judge Ian Strongman said: ""Any person could not fail to be dismayed by the devastation caused by Mr Price - he has turned it into a canal devoid of most life. It is ecological vandalism on an industrial scale.

""It was a desire to reduce the risk of flooding. Some residents who live nearby are grateful to Mr Price for taking this action.

""The Environment Agency said the overall river level is as high as in recent years but Mr Price's actions have made things worse.

""It is total ignorance of nature and the environment.""

Natural England and the Environment Agency described the damage as the worst case of riverside destruction they had ever seen and could take several decades to be fully restored.

Speaking after the case Emma Johnson, area manager for Natural England said: ""The destruction of this section of the River Lugg was devastating for the abundance and range of species which thrived in this river.

""The River Lugg is one of the most iconic rivers in the UK and to see this wanton destruction take place was devastating.

""This is why we have used our powers as regulators to see that justice was done and to act as a stark warning to others that we will take the strongest action against those who do not respect the laws that protect the environment and wildlife we all cherish.

""We want to ensure that Mr Price now takes the necessary actions which we hope, in time will restore this much-loved stretch of river to its former condition.""

Martin Quine, Environment Agency place manager for Herefordshire added: ""We welcome the outcome of this prosecution for the unconsented works on the River Lugg.

""The Environment Agency is working hard to restore the health of our rivers.

""It is a complex task that can only be achieved in partnership with landowners.

""We provide advice and guidance but will impose sanctions or prosecute where appropriate to protect the environment and ensure those who breach regulations are held to account.

""The vast majority of landowners and users fully cooperate with this process.

""While Mr Price's justification for the works was to help prevent flooding to local properties, his actions did not have any flood prevention benefit.

""The destruction of river banks is not appropriate flood management. It is important that the Judge recognised that the works significantly weakened flood prevention measures rather than improved them.

""We urge landowners never to take an extreme measure such as this and instead to always work closely with the Environment Agency around river management to agree on the best solutions for both landowners and the environment.""

Helen Stace, CEO of the Herefordshire Wildlife Trust, described Mr Price's actions previously as a ""crime against the environment"".

Environmentalists - including BBC Gardeners' World host Monty Don - also expressed his shock at the ""complete obliteration"" of the site.

Mr Don said: ""It breaks my heart but is all too typical of the ignorance, arrogance and sheer wanton destruction of those privileged to care for our countryside.""

But Mr Price said previously he was asked to carry out the work for free as he was fixing the erosion of the river bed and was helping to solve flooding issues.

He claimed the work he did on the riverbanks is legal and said he has the backing of local councillors and residents.

Homes were flooded during Storm Dennis in early 2020, but when Storm Christoph hit in January 2021, houses stayed dry.

Speaking after he cleared the riverbank, Mr Price said: ""I'm a Herefordshire farmer and have lived at Hay Farm and was born here at home.

""I have never moved and have watched this river all my life and no one knows this river better than myself.

""I have always looked after the river. I was asked to stop the erosion because I'm the landowner so I'm responsible for the river.

""It was up to the Environmental Agency to look after these rivers but they don't do any work and haven't got any money to do the work because they spend it all on clipboards.

""I have not pushed any trees out and I haven't knocked any trees down I have only cleared what ones came down in the flood.""

WARNING DISTURBING: Workers are seen kicking hens as they are battered to death after coming to the end of their egg-laying life in UK farms which supply some of the country's biggest supermarkets

Workers have been filmed kicking and stamping on hens at farms which supply some of Britain's biggest supermarkets.

Welfare group the Animal Justice Project spent months investigating ""catcher gangs"" employed by RSPCA Approved abattoir AD Harvey. Such gangs are used at chicken farms across the UK when birds come to the end of their natural egg-laying life. The chickens are then usually used for cheap meat, soups, stock, or stews. The AJP says around 30,000 hens were caught in one night at Kettleby Farm, Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, while similar incidents have been reported at farms in Kent, Oxfordshire, and Bedfordshire.

Veterinary professor of animal welfare, Andrew Knight, said: ""Workers engaged in incorrect and injurious handling techniques, including kicking and hitting hens, treading on them, and violently throwing them against shed walls. Some hens were severely injured or dead, while others experienced extreme distress, being carried upside down or by one leg."" Norfolk-based AD Harvey said: ""Those staff members are no longer employed by AD Harvey, and all other members of our bird catching staff are being retrained in the correct procedures.""

A spokesman for RSPCA Assured, the charity's welfare accreditation scheme, said: ""We are appalled by this footage. It is totally unacceptable for any animal to be treated in this way. We have suspended the membership of the catching company involved.""

Sunrise Poultry Farms, which owns Kettleby Farm, said it is ""crucial"" that all birds are treated with care. It added: ""We aim to uphold the highest possible standards of animal welfare.""

Michael Moss, 39, had been eating lunch in his garden when he heard screams for help and ran to find a local farmer trapped under half a ton of hay

A dad saved the life of a farmer crushed under half a ton of hay - by using an app to guide medics to the rural location.

Michael Moss, 39, had been eating lunch in his garden when he heard distant screams for help coming from the fields behind his home in Worksop, Notts.

He ran in the general direction of the anguished cries and found an idle tractor with a farmer nearby trapped underneath a 1,000lb industrial-sized bale of hay.

The farmer, known only as Stephen, was pinned to the ground from the waist down and in excruciating pain screaming out: ""Help me"".

Michael dialled 999 after being unable to budge the heavy bale himself - but knew he couldn't guide the ambulance to their exact location due to it being so rural.

Thinking on his feet, he decided to use his what3words app which provides an accurate location for emergency services, using three randomised words as a code.

By telling call handlers the words ""dads"", ""scorched"" and ""hairstyle"" medics were able to pinpoint where he was to within a three metre square radius.

Dad-of-two Michael said: ""It had been my daughters sixth birthday on June 23 but I was working and had been eating a sandwich outside before my next meeting.

""It was about 1.25pm and I could sort of hear a noise coming from about half a kilometre away. Where we live is very rural, when you hear something unusual you twitch your head.

""I heard it three times and thought that's definitely not a good noise. I had to investigate what the noise was. I ran through the woodland in my flip-flops and still holing my sandwich and could hear 'Help me' as I got closer. A male voice was screaming 'Help me'.

""I could see a tractor cab parked. I was worried what I was going to face now, is he impaled etc., who knows. That really triggered how am I going to deal with this. He was severely injured under the hay bale, it's not the first thing you'd think to see.

""I've approached the tractor from behind, something has fallen from the forks that he's been working on. I saw the hay bale and a top half of a body. I tried to shoulder barge this huge half tonne hay bale but that didn't work.

""I asked if he was losing blood, how the pain was. I was trying to get It for the 999 call. He told me to grab the phone for 999. I was thinking about how to describe where I am for emergency services.

""A previous boss worked in the emergency services and said I should download what3owrds, but thus was the first time I'd ever used it. As I'm on 999 they ask where we are. I said I've got what3words and they said that was good. She knew exactly where I was instantly.""

Paramedics arrived at the scene 15 minutes later and administered pain relief and some tranquilliser so they could transport him to the nearest hospital an hour away.

Michael said he was also able to help Stephen phone his farm hands who also arrived at the scene to try and shift the heavy bales.

He added: ""Stephen was on the phone to his farm hands and they thought he was taking the p**s. They started to arrive after about five to ten minutes.

""There was another hay bale above him, it had slipped. That was above his head, it was starting to slip near his head.

""You could hear the relief when we got the hay bale off and he tried to move about. At this point we became best mates.

""The best way to describe his lower body was like a squashed frog. His leg was in an unnatural opinion.""

Farmer Stephen was left with severe trauma to the pelvis and femur, but Micheal reckons it could have been much worse if he hadn't got there when he did.

He said: ""Those three minutes I had with what3words made all the difference. It can save someone's life. It made a difference we could help and made the it significantly helped without a question of a doubt. It made it easier to locate me.

""How would I describe it to them. Talking to someone who's never been to that area, you're two to three fields over. You're on a path of ambiguity.

""The phone signal is an area of contention. It's not great there. What3words gives you something you can do offline, using three words to save your life.""

What3words works by dividing the globe into a grid of 3m x 3m squares and given each square a unique combination of three words. The technology is said to now be used by 85 per cent of the UK's emergency services.

Mother-of-nine Amanda Owen split from husband Clive last June, explaining at the time that it was 'not unique, it's just how things are, pressures, all the rest of it'

She's well-known for her life on Our Yorkshire Farm, but this week Amanda Owen takes a break from her toils for a new adventure in the series Farming Lives.

The 48-year-old mother-of-nine (there's Raven, Reuben, Miles, Edith, Violet, Sidney, Annas, Clementine and Nancy, aged from 21 to five) and her husband Clive announced their separation last June.

Amanda told the Radio Times that the split was ""not unique, it's just how things are, pressures, all the rest of it. But we have nine kids, with associated friends, girlfriends, and we just have to get on with it.""

For this solo series, she heads off to visit other farmers to see how they're making things work during these testing times""¦

Hi, Amanda! Can you tell us about your new show?

I visit different farms and their owners and see what they're up to, how they've diversified and what challenges they're facing. It was good for me as I've been rather confined to my own hill end, so it was nice to get a different outlook.

You stay on each farm for a few nights - how was that?

Eating with them and talking about their lives was important. I keep thinking about having somebody come to stay here with me - I'd have to do some serious tidying!

How are each of the six farms different?

Some of them are first-generation farmers like me, and some are family farms that

have been handed down. They all have different stories. One of the first people I went to was a Ukrainian lady, who was farming pigs. She was inspired by reading the James Herriot books in the Ukraine, just like me, which blew my mind.

You visit two sisters who run their farm in Shetland with their mum. What was their story?

Their dad died suddenly so they were faced with a stark choice, carry on or quit. It was where they were brought up, where their childhood was, so they decided to make things work.

Filming the show meant you spending time away from home. Did the kids cope?

Oh, yes. Years of training means they're fine. The nature of what we do means there's always something to be done, so they can bake, cook, even tidy up - usually when I give them a warning that I'm coming back!

We've watched your family grow up on-screen. Have things got easier as the children have got older?

It's never easy, it's different challenges. But I must admit I do like being a part of their journey as they grow up and seeing them develop. Raven is away at university doing a Masters now, Reuben's working independently and loving it, Miles has left school and is working at home. It brings in new people and keeps you on your toes. I hope it keeps me young.

You've become a well-known face on TV. How has that been for you?

Life has its challenges, whether that's in media-land or on the farm. You have to adapt and change over time, don't you?

We always see you hard at work. Do you enjoy the glamorous part of showbiz too?

Of course I do, although I think at the moment I'd need a very big scrub and a manicure! I enjoy being not what people expect. I hate the idea of stereotyping. I might be 6ft 2in and work on the farm, but I can wear heels, stick on false eyelashes and be totally happy talking to a bunch of hill farmers while I'm doing it!

An angry farmer has shared their frustration as their cheeky neighbour had been pinching their homegrown fruit straight from the tree and told them they were 'selfish'

If we grew our own fruit, we'd be more than happy to share if we had extra to spare, but it's not quite the same when a neighbour is simply just helping themselves to your homegrown delights.

One farmer claims they'd been noticing a batch of plums going missing each year from a tree on their land and decided to get in their first for once and harvest their own fruit before someone else could take it. However, while they were doing so, they managed to catch the plum thief red-handed - and it just so happened to be one of their neighbours.

Red-faced, the neighbour branded the farmer 'selfish' for picking all the fruit off their own tree, and since then they've been unable to work out if they were in the wrong for their actions or not. So, taking to reddit to share their ordeal - the user explains how they were just harvesting their plums on their land from their own tree to make some jam when the neighbour came walking down with a basket to collect the fruit.

The post explains: ""I live in a very rural area and I'm a farmer. Obviously, I have a lot of land and there's a patch of land that borders our neighbourhood road where I have some plum trees. To be clear this is MY land, those are MY trees and there is a fence.

""This morning I decided to go harvest the plums rather early (7am) because we have a heat wave here. This variety of plum is hugely popular here in France, especially for jam, but are hard to come by here in the south (Mirabelle plums).

""Every year I wait for them to ripe, and every year a sizeable portion disappears. I suspected it was someone from the neighbourhood but never knew who.

""Well this morning I had my answer. So I was harvesting and was almost done when I see a neighbour walking down the road towards me with a basket!

""The second she saw me and realised that I was almost done with harvesting all the plums she proceeded to yell at me saying 'that is so selfish of you, you're not the only one to like them you know. You could at least have left some for the rest of us!'""

The farmer didn't rise to the yelling, but instead calmly proceeded to tell the neighbour that they would report them for theft if they were to take any of the plums again.

They added: ""This is a small neighbourhood. In a small village. She knows. She knows I own the land. She knows I'm a farmer. But she still yelled at me. For harvesting my fruits on my land.

""I just told her I know that people like them, which is why I'm making jam, and reminded her where and when she would find the farmers market if she wants to buy a jar or two.

""Then I told her that now that I know it's her stealing the plums if they disappear next year I will press charges for theft and trespassing.""

People have been quick to comment that the neighbour will continue stealing the plums, with one person commenting: ""I would recommend that you get a security camera before the next harvest that surveys your trees because you know she'll try to be sneaky next year.""

Another saying: ""She actually had the audacity to demand the fruits of YOUR labour.""

While someone else replied: ""She should have kept that to herself. She is plum dumb!""

Will Young, from Buckinghamshire, has been confirmed as one of the new Love Island contestants as the winter series kicks off on Monday

Love Island star Will Young has spoken about his plans for a reality show on his farm life after his stint in the South African villa this winter.

Will Young, from Buckinghamshire, has been confirmed as one of the new Islanders on the ITV reality show as the winter series kicks off on Monday, presented by new host Maya Jama.

The 23-year-old, who boasts 1.1million followers on his TikTok, where he posts clips from life on his farm, has now said he hopes to turn his large social media following into a television show centred around farming.

Speaking to the Mirror and a group of journalists, Will said: ""I'm semi doing it with the TikTok - throughout the year educating and just telling people what I'm doing.

""And I think that's why it has done so well because things that I do every day people don't get to see, people don't understand it.

""So I do think it's good getting it out there and I do it in a loving, light-hearted way. So yeah I'd definitely like to do something - fingers crossed, hopefully!""

Will has previously revealed that Claudia Winkleman, 50, once came to his Buckinghamshire farm and threw a bucket of water over him - while he was shirtless in the plummeting cold.

In November, the farmer took to TikTok where he shared a video of his hilarious interaction with the Strictly Come Dancing host.

On the special visit to his farm, Will said: ""It was such an amazing experience, her coming to the farm and doing a little bit of filming.

""It was just such an amazing experience, I do want to do it again.""

Will also revealed he once had a direct message to his social media from British rapper Lady Leshurr after using her song in one of his TikToks.

He said: ""A little bit with Lady Leshurr, but that was I just did a TikTok using her song - I put a little lamb in a bag and she loved it and DM'd me, it was like you know, 'this is great'.

""And she was actually supposed to come to the farm during lambing and we were gonna do some filming but it fell through.""

However, it's not all been plain-sailing on his social media so far, as the farmhand was criticised by animal rights charity PETA, as they claimed he ""exploits"" animals for his TikTok.

PETA re-shared a 2020 clip of Will, which he has since deleted from his TikTok account, which sees him dancing around a sheep giving birth before moving the newborn lamb to the music.

Re-sharing the clip to Instagram, the organisation wrote: ""This farmer is a disgusting creep!

""He's dancing over her body as she gives birth! Then he forces the second-old baby to ""˜dance' for clout on TikTok.""

In Operation Mille, the largest of its kind, 200,000 cannabis plants were seized - and the raids also recovered guns and other weapons such as crossbows and knives

Drugs worth £130million were seized by police in raids on 1,000 cannabis farms in a single month.

Forces across the country arrested 1,000 suspects during the operation to smash gangs. Twenty guns were also taken off the streets.

In Operation Mille, the largest of its kind, 200,000 cannabis plants were seized.

The guns and more than 40 other weapons such as crossbows and knives were confiscated. Around 11,000 officers were involved in the crackdown, involving every police force in England, Wales and Scotland.

The officers also seized £650,000 in cash from the criminal groups.

Gangs are also believed to have links to money-laundering, cocaine-trafficking and serious violence.

Police say large-scale industrial units and empty residential homes are used for cannabis farms.

Officers say the buildings can become dangerous as a result of farming, tampering with electricity supplies, fumes and water damage.

Steve Jupp, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for Serious and Organised Crime, said: ""Organised networks involved in cannabis production are also directly linked to an array of other criminality.""

He said the linked crimes included Class A drug importation, slavery and ""wider violence and exploitation"". He added: ""Cannabis-related crime is often thought to be ""˜low level'. However, there are patterns around the exploitation and violence crime groups use to protect their enterprises.

""We also frequently find that cannabis production is just one aspect of their criminal operations and that they are complicit in wider offending, which blights our communities.""

Lifelong activist Don Staniford says the video he captured 'was like something out of a horror film', while the Scottish Government has been forced to launch an investigation

A horrifying video of 'zombie salmon' missing chunks of flesh at a UK fish farm has forced the Government to launch an urgent investigation.

A lifelong activist shot the footage, which he says was like 'something out of a horror film', during a 48-hour undercover mission at Bakkafrost Scotland 's site in Portree - the largest town on the popular tourist destination on the Isle of Skye.

Long-time campaigner Don Staniford, who captured the footage, said the images were the 'worst I've ever seen'. Highland Council and Scottish Government officials have now launched an inquiry into the incident, while Mr Staniford has called for 'immediate action' to be taken.

Mr Staniford said: ""The zombie salmon on show inside the salmon farm are like an X-rated horror film. The horrific injuries inside Bakkafrost's Portree salmon farm were the worst I've ever witnessed.

""Bakkafrost has either not installed proper anti-predator netting or they have not properly maintained the equipment - either way this is a clear cut case of welfare abuse. If salmon farms cannot operate securely without breaching welfare legislation then they should be shut down immediately.""

Bakkafrost Scotland was formerly called the Scottish Salmon Company but formally changed its name last year after being acquired by Faroese firm Bakkafrost in 2019, The Daily Record reports. Staniford, director of campaign group $camon $cotland, kayaked out to the site on June 28 and 29 this year in the early hours of the morning.

He took the shocking footage using a GoPro waterproof camera mounted on a telescopic pole which he lowered into the cage. Staniford, a salmon farm campaigner for 25 years, says he saw salmon swimming around with gouges to their flesh. One was missing a huge chunk of flesh from the middle of its back.

He believes the salmon have been attacked by predators, probably seals, and demanded the firm take immediate action. Scottish ministers have outlawed the shooting of seals to protect farmed salmon although exemptions are allowed to 'alleviate suffering'.

Staniford, who kayaked back from the site accompanied by a number of seals, added: ""By failing to keep out predators, Bakkafrost has failed to protect the health and welfare of the hundreds of thousands of salmon cooped up in the cages. If chicken farmers allowed foxes free entry into hen houses to slaughter their stock the public would be outraged. Now that the killing of seals is banned, salmon farmers have a duty to install anti-predator netting.""

A Bakkafrost Scotland spokesperson said: ""Bakkafrost Scotland are committed to the welfare and health of our fish and the natural environment, both of which are intrinsically linked and represent the basis of responsible salmon farming.

""We have just become aware of a film showing two fish which appear to have been attacked by seals, and which is suggested to have been taken at our Portree site. As with all farmers the health and welfare of our stock is of paramount importance, and a recent RSPCA inspection at the site did not flag any issues.""

A spokesperson for RSPCA Assured, which was also notified of the concerns, said: ""We looked into this as soon as it was reported to us, including carrying out an in-person visit. We are satisfied that the farm was doing everything they could to protect the welfare of both the salmon and any predators, such as seals, by trying to prevent any predators from entering the pen, as required by the RSPCA's standards.""

A spokesperson for Highland Council confirmed it had received a complaint, adding: ""We are liaising with our animal health partners in Scottish Government on the investigation."" The Scottish Government ­confirmed it was aware of the complaint but declined to ­comment further while its ­investigation was ongoing.

Despite swapping ITV Emmerdale for life on a farm, Kelvin Fletcher joked that sadly nothing he picked up from his time on the soap was relatable or transferable to his new career

Seven years after departing Emmerdale, actor Kelvin Fletcher is clearly embracing his new career with his wife, Elizabeth.

The 39-year old rose to fame after joining the ITV soap in 1996 as Andy Sugden - the foster child of Dales icon Jack Sugden and his wife, Sarah. After quitting the soap in 2016, Kelvin went on to star in Strictly Come Dancing and lifted the Glitterball Trophy with his professional dance partner, Oti Mabuse in 2019.

Since then, however, he has largely shunned the limelight, instead opting for a new life in the country alongside Elizabeth and their four young children. The family are now the proud owners of a 120-acre holding on the edge of the Peak District, where they are responsible for 100 sheep, 30 pigs, 10 horses, six chickens, a cat and their dog, Ginger.

In a segment on Friday's Good Morning Britain, meanwhile, Kelvin gave viewers an insight into farming life, introducing three adorable eight-week old piglets. Discussing the career change, he admitted: ""We didn't plan on this, but sometimes the best things in life are those that are unplanned really.""

Co-host Ranvir Singh responded: ""I know that wasn't scripted - it sounds like you really know your stuff. People will just assume its a home from home for you, Kelvin."" Nodding, Kelvin joked: ""I wish! Obviously the last two years for us as a family moving to the countryside and trying to farm - and get your head around farming - has been a whirlwind.""

He continued: ""It's been a little overwhelming at times if I'm honest, but that's the beauty of this... adventure. It's a new chapter for us and there's nothing relatable or transferable from my time in Emmerdale unfortunately! I always tell myself Rome wasn't built in a day.""

Together Kelvin and Elizabeth front Kelvin's Big Farming Adventure, which returns for a new series next year. Elizabeth then offered viewers an exclusive preview, showing off the farm's newly acquired Jacob sheep. Co-host Ben Shephard then joked that being so-called it was in his blood too to handle sheep.

The married pair previously revealed Covid boredom played a part in their decision to buy a farm. Elizabeth said in October: ""It was Kelvin's idea. We had two children, no real responsibilities, they weren't at school, we had no jobs""¦ then all visas got stopped, but we were in the mindset for change. Kelvin saw this farm on Rightmove and said, 'Liz, what about buying this?'""

Kelvin added: ""We didn't do it because we wanted to be farmers. We wanted something different. We looked at all sorts of places but the thought of this quiet, idyllic life got us. Then, lo and behold, it's not as quiet as you thought. There are sheep, so you think, 'I'll get some more sheep.' Then it snowballs.""

Will Young's parents have jumped to the 'modern generation farmer's defence, after PETA branded the future Love Island star 'a disgusting creep' over a controversial TikTok post

Will Young's parents have defended the future Love Island star amid backlash from animal rights groups.

His mother has blasted critics who are attacking the budding reality TV star online - calling the 'nasty comments' about her son 'completely wrong'.

Will's dad also backed the 'modern generation farmer' and claimed his child was 'simply showing what life is like on a farm', but admitted he doesn't necessarily 'approve' of all the videos his son shares online.

The farmer, 32, was branded a 'disgusting creep' by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) earlier this week, after a now-deleted TikTok clip showed Will dancing around a sheep giving birth before moving the newborn lamb to the music.

Re-sharing the clip to Instagram, the organisation wrote: ""This farmer is a disgusting creep!

""He's dancing over her body as she gives birth! Then he forces the second-old baby to ""˜dance' for clout on TikTok.""

A representative of PETA then went on to say that the fifth generation farmer should be ashamed of posting TikTok dances with a seconds-old lamb for 'social media clickbait'.

But Will's parents have hit back at critics and defended their son, who is due to enter the Love Island villa in South Africa on Monday night.

His proud mum Jenny Young insists her son is a ""lovely, caring, young man"" and always looked after and nurtured his pets as a young child.

""Those people making all those nasty comments are completely wrong. He is such a caring person,"" Jenny told the MailOnline.

Will's father, Andrew, 55, added his belief some critics may have misinterpreted his son's since-deleted TikTok clip - explaining how Will actually added music to the clip after tending to the sheep.

""He would never trivialise something as important as lambing. People have taken the video completely the wrong way,"" Andrew argued.

""He is a modern generation farmer. I may not approve of all the videos but he knows what he is doing and has built up a big following.""

He goes on to explain how Will is ""simply showing what life is like working on a farm"" and he was not dancing around the sheep - that was all added in the edit.

PETA Vice President of Programmes Elisa Allen previously told The Sun : ""Women want a man who cares about animals, not someone who exploits them for their fleece, their flesh, or social media clickbait.

""Mr Young might want to consider that the cholesterol in meat and dairy can clog the arteries to all organs, not just the heart - and switch to a vegan diet if he wants to please his partner in the villa or later in his life.""

Will's family farm is estimated to be worth around £1.6 million and has a cottage - called The Dairy - which can be rented out for £600 for three nights on Airbnb.

Will is one of the 10 singletons who will enter the plush new luxury £1.2million South African mansion next week.

Producer Fredi Devas said that while filming for Planet Earth in Nepal, he was fascinated to see local people treating a rhino in a busy urban area with such respect

Capturing amazing footage of a rhino on a busy street looking for food was a bittersweet experience for a Planet Earth III filmmaker.

Producer Fredi Devas said: ""It is sad the urban environment is encroaching on wild places but I was also filled with admiration for the local people that treated the rhino with such respect."" The greater one-horned rhino in Nepal is perhaps the most dramatic example in Sunday's episode of how wildlife is adapting to the human world.

But other animals revealing extraordinary behaviour in Sir David Attenborough's series include macaques in Bali that steal from tourists and return items in exchange for favourite foods. Fredi had seen videos of rhinos in the streets of Sauraha but did not believe it had happened until, after waiting a long time, he filmed the animal on an ultra-high-definition, low-light camera walking past shops and alongside people and cars.

He said: ""I eventually saw a rhino with my thermal binoculars, heading out of the jungle and coming straight towards me. It was a thrilling experience that I didn't get tired of for the three weeks we were there.

""Towards the end of the filming trip, as the rhino walked on a bustling road, past busy shops and cafes, I pondered that this rhino must have seen more change in its lifetime than any previous generation of rhino. A wild animal that looks like a living dinosaur, very much present in the modern era. With proper consideration for wild animals, there's every hope humans and animals can live peacefully alongside each other, even with potentially dangerous animals like rhinos.""

He hopes seeing the rhino, one of about 4,000 left in the wild, scavenging for food on a street may persuade more people to turn vegetarian. The biggest threat to wildlife is from habitat destruction, mostly for farming and agriculture, which takes up half of the world's habitable land. Over three-quarters of agricultural land is used for livestock and yet this provides only about 20% of our calories and 40% of our protein.

Fredi said: ""More people are choosing to eat foods that have a lower impact on the natural world and food manufacturers are getting on board. The choices for eating plant-based meals are rapidly increasing. If this trend continues, it may be a huge step towards restoring the health of our planet.""

The programme also examines how venomous monocled cobras, which deliver enough poison to kill 10 people in a single bite, live harmoniously in people's homes in West Bengal, India. The Hindu villagers consider them demigods and scientists believe this tolerance has led the snakes to become more placid and less volatile.

The episode also looks at how tawny frogmouth birds thrive in Melbourne, Australia, by using streetlights to find prey, plus ants in New York whose digestive systems adapt to eat human food. And it shows how in Lake Tahoe, US,, black bears head to city rubbish bins in search of sustenance before hibernation.

The rich food they find means that they are up to 50% heavier than their country-dwelling cousins.

The ""potentially widespread"" contamination has been reported at gas stations along Florida's Gulf Coast could cause car engines and power generators to stop working just as Idalia hits

Drivers fleeing Storm Idalia are being warned cars could stop working due to fuel contamination caused by ""human error'.

The ""potentially widespread"" contamination has been reported at gas stations along Florida's Gulf Coast could cause car engines and power generators to stop working just as Idalia hits. It comes as thousands have been warned by authorities to ensure their vehicles are at least half full should a hurricane evacuation order be issued.

The contamination was caused by ""human error"" at the Port of Tampa, according to a news alert from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Affected gasoline and diesel was supplied by Citgo and may have been sold at nearly 30 stations after 10 a.m. ET on Saturday, mostly along the Florida coast from the Tampa Bay region to Fort Myers.

Using the fuel could cause engine damage or stop a vehicle or generator from operating entirely, FDACS warned. Speaking at a press briefing Sunday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the potentially hazardous situation was caused by a simple mix-up. He said: ""Basically it was just human error ""” they just put diesel in tanks that were supposed to be regular gas.

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US

""If you have a tank of gas and it's 90% regular and 10% diesel, the dilution probably may not ruin your car. But, I mean, if you put a whole tank of diesel, that's going to be a major, major problem.""

The impacted stations all have been asked to stop selling gas until the fuel can be replaced and the tanks that were used can be cleaned. BJ's Wholesale, 7-Eleven and Handy Foods were some of the impacted stores. Florida's Division of Emergency Management has also waived size, weight and hour restrictions for transporting gas and diesel in the state to ensure consumers could have access to fuel as quickly as possible.

The National Hurricane Centre warned that as of 4am CDT today, Idalia's centre was approximately 125 miles south of the western tip of Cuba. The storm's maximum sustained winds have reached 65mph, and it's moving northward at a speed of 7mph.

Thousands of people spent the weekend and much of today preparing for the onslaught of the storm, with many using wheelbarrows to transport sandbags and others seen carrying their belongings from homes as they self-evacuate.

Storm surges as high as 11ft are being predicted as more than 1,000 National Guardsmen have been mobilised, with high water vehicles and aircrafts on hand to help with evacuations. People are being urged to stock up on supplies and have at least half a tank of gas in their vehicles.

Ron DeSantis issued an executive order Saturday declaring a state of emergency for 33 counties ahead of the potential inclement weather. An announcement read: ""The Governor and the Florida Division of Emergency Management are taking timely precautions to ensure Florida's communities, infrastructure and resources are prepared, including those communities that are still recovering following Hurricane Ian.""

Large parts of the western coast of Florida are at risk for storm surges and floods. Pasco and Levy counties, located north of Tampa, both ordered mandatory evacuations for some residents. In Levy County, officials said residents of Cedar Key must be off the island by Tuesday evening because storm surges would make bridges impassable.

""Once the storm surge comes in, help may not be available to reach you,"" the county said in a public advisory. The National Hurricane Center in Miami issued a hurricane warning Monday from Longboat Key in the Sarasota area to the Holocene River, up past Tampa Bay.

Brazil's National Institute of Criminalistics reportedly found large amounts of highly toxic pesticide residues in samples collected from her eyes, blood, stomach, and urine at autopsy

Cops in Brazil have been hunting a mysterious fortune-teller after she gave the mother of a young child poisoned sweets who later died in the hospital.

Police in the city of Maceio, Brazil, say the family of Fernanda Silva Valoz da Cruz Pinto claim she had been given the sweets that poisoned her at the start of August before she died a day later. Brazil's National Institute of Criminalistics reportedly found large amounts of highly toxic pesticide residues in samples collected from her eyes, blood, stomach, and urine during Fernanda's autopsy.

Head of the Chemistry and Toxicology Laboratory that analysed her samples, Thalmanny Goulart, said: ""Unfortunately, another case involving poisoning by the substances sulfotep and terbufos. These substances are highly prevalent in cases of poisoning, [and] intoxication in Brazil due to their easy access, despite being regulated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply.""

The young mum of a nine-year-old daughter was brought to the Santa Casa de Misericordia hospital after she ate the sweets on 3rd August. She reportedly suffered from severe stomach pain, vomiting, and was bleeding from her nose at the time she was admitted.

Her cousin Lumenita Valoz, said that she developed the symptoms just hours after she ate the sweets, and said: ""It was on the 3rd that she ate the candy. She passed away in the early hours of 4th August. She was alone. She didn't mention the location.""

Civil Police registered her case as 'a death to be clarified', and are awaiting the forensic results so that they can confirm homicide speculations. The Capital Homicide Police Station said they would investigate her death. No motive has been given for the poisoning as of yet.

Drinking one type of hot drink in moderation could help fight off one of the devastating biological processes involved in Alzheimer's disease, a new study claims

Just one espresso a day could help keep Alzheimer's at bay, according to a new study.

Researchers have found that the dark shot of coffee destroys rogue tau proteins that gather in the brain and attack your neurons - meaning it can stave off some processes associated with the disease.

Positive effects even come if the drink is consumed in a trendy Espresso Martini cocktail.

Lead author Professor Mariapina D'Onofrio, of Verona University, said: ""Espresso coffee mitigates the aggregation and condensation of Alzheimer's associated tau.""

'Tangles' in tau proteins are one of the key causes of dementia , which can cause slow thinking and memory skills.

While tau helps stabilise structures in the brain in healthy people, it can clump together into 'fibrils' in those with neurodegenerative diseases.

Lab experiments showed espresso works against this - and it's good news for Italians, as an estimated 96% drink it on a daily basis.

Prof D'Onofrio said: ""As the concentration of espresso extract, caffeine or genistein increased, fibrils were shorter and didn't form larger sheets, with the complete extract showing the most dramatic results.

""Shortened fibrils were found to be non-toxic to cells, and they did not act as 'seeds' for further aggregation.""

The team used a scanning technique called nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study espresso shots from store-bought beans to characterise their chemical makeup.

Professor D'Onofrio said: ""Whether enjoyed on its own or mixed into a latte, Americano or even a martini, espresso provides an ultra-concentrated jolt of caffeine to coffee lovers.

""But it might do more than just wake you up. Espresso compounds can inhibit tau protein aggregation - a process that is believed to be involved in the onset of Alzheimer's disease.""

Dark, rich espresso is regularly drunk by around 13% of people in the UK, and is much more popular in some southern European nations.

Italians knock back some 30 million espressos a day in porcelain cups or little glasses, with or without a splash of milk. It's traditionally seen as a gesture of friendship.

The drink is made by grinding a relatively large amount of coffee beans - typically around 20 grams - as finely as possible.

While coffee consumption has been associated with health risks for many years, recent studies have showed that when consumed in moderation, the hot drink can have benefits thanks to ""its biological properties"", according to Professor D'Onofrio.

Coffee is rich in antioxidants, and regular consumption has been linked to reduced risk of premature death - protecting against type 2 diabetes, heart disease, liver and some cancers.

The findings in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry could also pave the way toward developing other bioactive compounds.

Research by the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee suggests 'promoting more actively in Albania and elsewhere the provision of short-term work visas in sectors in which the UK needs workers

MPs today call on the Government to recruit Albanians to help tackle staff shortages.

A study by the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee suggests a campaign in Albania ""and elsewhere"" to promote temporary work visas in industries worst hit by short staff shortages.

It could prevent more Albanians crossing the Channel in small inflatable boats and claiming asylum, according to the panel.

""There is no case for special treatment for Albania in provision of work visas: its citizens are as entitled as any others to apply for those available in the UK,"" says the report.

""There may, though, be a case for promoting more actively in Albania and elsewhere the provision of short-term work visas in sectors in which the UK needs workers - seasonal agriculture or construction, for example - with the specific aim of enabling some transfer of wealth to countries from which asylum applications should not normally be countenanced but from which substantial numbers of people seek opportunities elsewhere.""

Committee chairwoman Dame Diana Johnson warned: ""People will continue to be attracted to the UK from Albania while it continues to offer job opportunities and higher wages.

""The UK should look at how access to work visa schemes can be improved to fill our skills or staffing gaps, while offering Albanian nationals a route to higher income, benefiting both nations.""

More than a quarter of the 45,755 migrants who crossed the Channel in small inflatable boats last year came from Albania - and most claimed asylum.

The number arriving in small boats over the Dover Strait - the world's busiest shipping lane - rocketed from 800 in 2021 to 12,301 in 2022.

Publishing its 30-page ""˜Asylum and migration: Albania' report today, the committee says the rise ""was both unexpected and unexplained"".

Dame Diana said: ""Such a substantial sudden increase in asylum claims from a seemingly peaceful country understandably raised concerns.""

Arrivals from Albania have slumped dramatically this year - and the committee ""found little evidence to indicate significant numbers of Albanian nationals are at risk in their own country and require asylum in the UK"".

However, it adds: ""While claims for political asylum should not normally be entertained, there are unquestionably cases of Albanian citizens being trafficked to the UK, from within Albania or from within other European countries, where appropriate safeguards must be in place before they are returned to Albania.""

Women are ""disproportionately at risk from this form of crime"", it says.

Earlier this month, the Home Office launched an advertising campaign to deter Albanians from coming to Britain.

The adverts, running in Albanian on Facebook and Instagram, warn they ""face being detained and removed"" if they make the dangerous journey across the Channel.

The Government claimed the campaign would ""make clear the perils"" faced by migrants on small boats.

Last week, Rishi Sunak said numbers of Albanians heading to Britain had plummeted in recent months.

The Prime Minister added: ""So far this year, the number of Albanian small boat arrivals has fallen by almost 90%.""

He said a returns deal with Tirana had led to 1,800 people being sent back.

Stink bugs have been found in many states and this time of year is when they are seen the most as the temperatures plummet and the insects try to find their way into people's homes

Invasive stink bugs are wreaking havoc across US states.

The unwelcome guests have become an unfortunate sight in the autumn season when leaves are changing and temperatures are dropping. Called the brown marmorated stink bug, the pest has been found in many homes in states across the US before winter sets in.

The critter was first found in Pennsylvania and by 2021 it had been seen every state apart from Alaska, South Dakota, and Wyoming. A study has even suggested their invasion could get worse,

The invasive species has severely impacted states on the east and west coasts, but areas of the Midwest. Central states between Montana and North Dakota and further south have ""no evidence of established populations,"" the US Department of Agriculture said.

The bugs are more annoying in autumn and on warm days multiple insects try come through doors and windows. If you are unlucky to have stood on one the bug gives off an unpleasant smell which can cause allergic reactions. The bugs, however, will not cause damage to your home. University of Wisconsin-Madison says many insect killers have not been updated to tackle the brown stink bug. Pest controllers can provide relief for those who are bothered by them in exterior locations.

Other things that can be done be done to prevent the bugs entering your home include making making sure openings in and around your home are sealed-off.

More pleasant smelling smells can be put on window sills to deter the bugs, Other products such as clove, lemongrass, and spearmint also help keep the bugs away. Experts recommend removing them them with a vacuum which can result in it giving off a bad smell over a period of time They can also be squashed flushed down the toilet or put in a container with soapy water according to insect controllers.

Experts advise against using insecticide inside as a dead bug may attract other insects which feed on the stink bugs. The pests eat as much as they can in autumn and live off stored energy during winter months. They can do without food until spring and will not reproduce.

But the winter months and the cold will not see them die, Thomas P. Kuhar, associate professor in the Department of Entomology at Virginia Tech found the stink bugs could endure temperatures below -4 degrees F.

The Mirror told in 2021 how a 'stink bug' which gives off a sickening smell could be invading homes and ruining fruit crops within ten years. The smelly bug is native to East Asia, but one has been recently found in the Royal Horticultural Society's garden in Surrey.

It is brown in colour and has a speckled pattern on its back, was first discovered in the UK last August at a nature reserve in Essex.

The stink bug has also been spotted in London, Suffolk and Hampshire, which has led scientists to believe it is spreading.

Fifteen criminals are said to have stormed Colin Armstrong's home, which is known as the Rodeo Grande ranch, in the Ecuadorian province of Los Rios before kidnapping him and his wife

Prominent British businessman Colin Armstrong has reportedly been kidnapped in Ecuador, according to local media.

Criminals entered his ranch, which is called the Rodeo Grande ranch, in the province of Los RÃ­os. Local media cited police sources saying that 15 men entered the residence and abducted him and his partner, who is of Colombian nationality.

A video said to show signs of forced entry, along with traces of blood and ransacked rooms, is understood to be circulating on social media. Police have confirmed they are investigating the kidnap in Baba in the province of Los Rios.

As well as being Britain's Honorary Consul in Guayaquil, Mr Armstrong is the founder of a large firm in Ecuador called Agripac that produces, distributes and sells agricultural and industrial supplies.

He is also the owner of Tupgill Park Estate in North Yorkshire, which was his childhood home. It is open to the public as a visitor attraction. Its attractions include the Forbidden Corner, a garden originally built as a private folly by Mr Armstrong and architect Malcolm Tempest. The 78-year-old expat businessman was awarded the OBE and CMG for services to the British Monarchy in 2011.We'll be bringing you the very latest updates, pictures and video on this breaking news story.

A spokesman for Ecuadorian police said: ""Following an apparent criminal act against a businessman in the early hours of this morning in Los Rios, specialist police units are carrying out operative and investigative work on the ground.""

The Colombian woman said to have been kidnapped along with Mr Armstrong is being described as his wife and has been named locally as Katherine Paola Santos. The honorary consul's car, a black BMW the kidnap victims are said to have been driven away in, has reportedly been found abandoned on the road between Baba and the nearby town of Salitre.

The kidnap is understood to have happened around 2.45am local time this morning at Mr Armstrong's ranch called Rancho Rodeo Grande One unconfirmed local report said the men who took the couple were wearing police uniforms.

An FCDO spokesperson said: ""We are in contact with the Ecuadorean authorities following the disappearance of a British man and are supporting his family.""

202,"Aspartame sweetener found in Diet Coke may cause cancer but ruled safe to drink","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/breaking-aspartame-sweetener-found-diet-30462476","Aspartame sweetener found in Diet Coke may cause cancer but ruled safe to drink

Despite one part of the WHO claiming the sweetener should be added to the list of substances that can cause cancer, another has said there was ""no convincing evidence"" of harm from drinking or eating products that contain it

A widely used artificial sweetener called aspartame - found in Diet Coke and hundreds of soft drinks - is safe to consume, a World Health Organisation (WHO) committee has concluded.

Despite one part of the WHO claiming the sweetener should be added to the list of substances that can cause cancer, another has said there was ""no convincing evidence"" of harm from drinking or eating products that contain it.

Aspartame, which is commonly used as a sugar substitute in foods and beverages, is found in nearly all diet and zero-sugar fizzy drinks and in some sugar-free chewing gum.

The World Health Organization's cancer agency has deemed the sweetener a ""possible"" cause of cancer, while a separate expert group looking at the same evidence said it still considers the sugar substitute safe in limited quantities.

""We're not advising consumers to stop consuming (aspartame) altogether,"" said WHO's nutrition director Dr. Francesco Branca. ""We're just advising a bit of moderation.""

The differing results of the coordinated reviews were released early Friday. One came from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, a special branch of the WHO. The other report was from an expert panel selected by WHO and another U.N. group, the Food and Agriculture Organization.

The Lyon, France-based cancer agency periodically reviews potential cancer hazards, but doesn't determine how likely they are to cause cancer in their evaluations which range from ""possibly"" carcinogenic to ""probably"" to cancer-causing.

Aspartame joins a category with more than 300 other possible cancer-causing agents, including things like aloe vera extract, Asian-style pickled vegetables and carpentry work.

The guidance on use of the sweetener, though, isn't changing.

There are more than 1,100 different things listed as full or possible carcinogens - ranging from ingredients in food and drink to living conditions to dangerous activities.

Previously, eating red meat was placed onto the list of possible carcinogens in humans, along with using mobile phones and working night shifts.

But the categories do not take into account how much of a product a person can safely consume - therefore only huge doses consumed over many years are likely to have a negative effect.

Professor Oliver Jones, an expert in chemistry at the RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, explained: ""It is also important to note that just because something may possibly cause cancer does not mean that it automatically does if you are exposed to it.

The different types of carcinogen

""The dose makes the poison. For example we know UV light in sunlight causes cancer, that's why we put on sunscreen at the beach - but we don't put on sunscreen when we go outside in winter even though we are still exposed to sunlight, why? Because the dose is lower in winter.""

The WHO said previously in a statement it was going to determine whether aspartame poses a risk.

The expert panel said: ""The IARC has assessed the potential carcinogenic effect of aspartame (hazard identification).

""Following this, the joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (Jecfa) will update its risk assessment exercise on aspartame, including the reviewing of the acceptable daily intake and dietary exposure assessment for aspartame.""

The additive was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1974 as a sweetener and an ingredient in food and drinks.

But in 1981, a joint international organisation named Jecfa, recommended a maximum daily intake of around 40mg per kilogram of body weight.

An adult weighing 60kg (132lbs) would have to drink between 12 and 36 cans of diet soda ""” depending on the amount of aspartame in the beverage ""” every day to be at risk.

Consumption advice for individuals comes from a separate expert committee on food additives, known as the Joint WHO and Food and Agriculture Organisation's Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), alongside national regulators.

What products contain aspartame?

You'll find aspartame in drinks, desserts, sweets, dairy products, chewing gums, energy-reduced and weight control products and even as a sweetener for tea and coffee.

You'll also find it in branded sugar-free fizzy pop like Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Pepsi Max, and 7 Up Free.

Other well-known products containing aspartame include Dr Pepper, some Fanta flavours, Muller Light yoghurts, Wrigley's Extra sugar-free chewing gum, some Lucozade drinks, Tango Orange, Irn Bru, Powerade, Ribena Light and some toothpastes and sugar-free cough drops among others.

Human African trypanosomiasis can be fatal without treatment. The World Health Organisation hopes to eliminate the disease, which is mainly present in sub-Saharan Africa, by 2030

The World Health Organisation has warned people about the risks of contracting a disease commonly known as ""sleeping sickness"", which can be fatal without treatment.

Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is transmitted to humans by bites of Tsetse flies which have acquired the parasites from infected humans or animals. These flies inhabit sub-Saharan Africa and only certain species transmit the disease. The most exposed populations are those living in rural areas and dependent on agriculture, fishing, animal husbandry or hunting.

Travellers who spent a lot of time outdoors or visit game parks in sub-Saharan Africa are also at risk of getting infected. There is no vaccine or medicine that prevents African trypanosomiasis.

The main symptoms of the condition are fatigue, high fever, headaches, and muscle aches. If left untreated, the disease can cause death. Depending on the parasite subspecies, HAT takes two forms, the WHO explains. Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, which found in 24 countries of west and central Africa, currently accounts for 92% of reported cases and causes a chronic illness.

A person can be infected for months or even years without major signs or symptoms - and when evident symptoms emerge, often the disease is advanced with the central nervous system already affected.

The other form is Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, which is found in 13 countries of eastern and southern Africa accounts for 8% of reported cases and causes an acute disease. The first symptoms emerge a few weeks or months after infection, and the disease develops quickly, often invading other organs including the brain.

Treatment options depend on the form of the disease and its stage. It is more likely to treat HAT successfully if symptoms are spotted early. One of the most common drugs used to treat first-stage T.B. gambiense infection is Pentamidine. Other drugs used include suramin, melarsoprol, eflornithine, and nifurtimox when used in combination with eflornithine.

After treatment, patients should be closely followed for 24 months and monitored for relapse because parasites may remain viable and reproduce the disease many months afterwards.

The first case of sleeping sickness was reported in the late 14th century, and now health experts hope a new experimental drug could help eradicate the disease, which is predominant in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

The drug, called acoziborole, is taken by mouth in just a single dose - and there are hopes it could halt transmission of the disease. Across the DRC and Guinea, there are 10 clinical trial sites testing the drug with the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiatives.

According to Science News, following a small trial carried out last year, the drug was found to be safe and effective. The results of a larger trial, which is currently being carried out, are expected by the end of this year.

Emmanuel Bottieau, an infectious disease specialist at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, who is not involved with the clinical trial, said acoziborole could be ""a game changer"" if the findings hold up. He said a single-dose medication is ""really a dream for us, coming from such a long history of very difficult or toxic or cumbersome treatments.""

HAT, which is called sleeping sickness as one of its prominent features is sleep cycle disturbance, is on a short list of neglected tropical diseases the WHO is targeting for elimination by 2030. This means bringing cases in certain areas down to zero, knowing that control efforts may still be required.

In 2021, the WHO reported 747 of the predominant form of HAT, down from more than 37,000 in 1998. JosÃ© RamÃ³n Franco, a WHO medical officer based in Geneva, said: ""We are advancing very well but we [haven't] reached the last mile.""

The OceanGate Expeditions submarine takes tourists to see the wreckage of the Titanic which sits 12,500ft below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada

This is the first photo of father and son Shahzada and Suleman Dawood who are missing following the disappearance of the submarine taking tourists to see the Titanic wreckage.

The 48-year-old dad, a prominent Pakistani businessman, and his son were identified as being onboard the vessel by family and colleagues.

It is understood from the vessel's operator, OceanGate Expeditions, the submarine had a 96-hour oxygen supply in case of emergencies - meaning the people on board have around two days of ""life support"" left.

The father and his 19-year-old son, who are both British citizens, belong to one of Pakistan's most prominent families, it is reported.

Their firm invests in agriculture, industries and the health sector, while Shahzada Dawood is also on the board of trustees for the California-based SETI Institute, which searches for extra-terrestrial intelligence, according to a news agency.

The vessel, which vanished yesterday, is used to take tourists to see the wreckage of the Titanic, which sits 12,500ft below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada.

The US Coast Guard is expanding its search as concerns continue to grow for the crew on board the submersible, which went missing on a trip to see the Titanic shipwreck in the Atlantic.

It searched an area ""about the size of Connecticut"" overnight for the missing submarine, which has five people inside.

As the search continues this morning, the team is expanding its capabilities to be able to search under the water as well, according to US Coast Guard First District Commander Rear Admiral John Mauger.

Brit billionaire Hamish Harding was also on board the submarine-like vessel taking paying tourists to view the famous wreck, 370 miles off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada.

The adventurer, who is chairman of private plane firm Action Aviation, was on the 21ft vessel when it set off for what should have been an eight-hour trip to the bottom of the Atlantic.

Former US nuclear submarine commander David Marquet believes there is now less than a one per cent chance of the crew surviving ""if they are on the bottom"".

And tourist Mike Reiss took the same journey to the Titanic last year and says he's ""not optimistic"" about the submarine being located.

Speaking about the crew's chances of survival, he told BBC Breakfast: ""I'm not optimistic just because I know the logistics of it.

An OceanGate Expeditions statement read yesterday: ""We are exploring and mobilizing all options to bring the crew back safely. Our entire focus is on the crewmembers in the submersible and their families.

""We are deeply thankful for the extensive assistance we have received from several government agencies and deep sea companies in our efforts to reestablish contact with the submersible.

""We are working toward the safe return of the crewmembers.""

Ever wondered who may need to repopulate the earth in the event of mass extinction? Researchers say Australia and New Zealand have the best fighting chance

If you're terrified of a nuclear apocalypse - head Down Under.

That's according to the latest findings which suggest Australia and New Zealand are the best-placed countries to survive both manmade and natural disasters which would wipe out swathes of the population.

Researchers have looked at 38 different island nations' chances of surviving events like an asteroid strike or nuclear winter, and have revealed those which rank best for repopulating civilisation.

Factors such as how capable the land is of regrowth to produce food and energy, as well as infrastructure, were studied to see which places could survive mass disasters in pockets.

Also making the cut were Iceland, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, a group of islands in the South Pacific.

Indonesia, the Philippines and Mauritius were also outlined as being in with a good chance.

But the UK was not specifically examined among the case studies for its chances of surviving a nuclear apocalypse.

The study, published in the Risk Analysis journal, states that there would likely be a small number of survivors even in the worst case scenario.

New Zealand topped the list but still isn't without risk, the researchers said, as reliance on trade with us here in the UK and the US would be gone.

The study pointed at the Kiwis' nuclear-free status and resilience to abrupt temperature drops - due to being relatively small and surrounded by ocean, the nation is cushioned from the blows of a nuclear winter.

Even in the worst case scenario of 61% of crops destroyed in a nuclear apocalypse, New Zealanders would still have enough to eat, said Prof Nick Wilson, one of the study's authors.

Australia, also topping the list, was meanwhile described as having a ""gigantic"" food supply buffer in the event of animals and crops dying.

Iceland's NATO membership meanwhile puts it at slightly higher risk status, the researchers said, and would also suffer from a lack of trade with the US and Europe.

But the mid-Atlantic Scandinavian island is described as being incredibly self-sufficient, producing its own renewable energy and would be able to rely on fishing for food.

""There will likely be pockets of survivors around the planet in even the most severe ASRS [abrupt sunlight reduction scenarios],"" wrote Prof Wilson and co-author Dr Matt Boyd.

""However, trade in food, energy, components, and expertise is needed to maximise survival chances in the face of severe climate effects and the cascading impacts across many human and ecological systems.

""Collapse of technological society is possible even in locations considered most likely to survive. This may seriously impede cooperation, coordination, and resilient food production.""

Mary Earps' post-match interview with ITV was a timely and salient reminder that women's footballers are not the unflappable, imperturbable influencers that they are increasingly demanded to be-nor should they be.

Seeing Mary Earps break down on television was strange.

There was a fleeting moment in which watching the England goalkeeper lament her self-inflicted woes in real time was refreshing, some might argue inspiring, a word that crops up whenever footballers break from the usual bloodless post-match script and remove their media-trained veils to reveal raw emotion.

But mostly Friday evening's post-match interview with ITV was peculiar. England won. The Olympics dream is still, technically, alive. Earps' error, while significant in that it doubled Netherland's advantage before the interval, was neither seismic nor decisive thanks to Georgia Stanway, Lauren Hemp and Ella Toone.

Lionesses boss Sarina Wiegman curtly dismissed Earps' claims that she ""˜let down' the team through one ultimately harmless blunder, more distressed that such a sentiment had even crossed the Manchester United shot-stopper's mind.

But it's worth considering: Why had it? This is, after all, Mary Earps. The woman who single-handedly took on the global sporting juggernaut that is Nike-and won . Who was the subject of a world-record bid for a women's goalkeeper, and likely will be again. Who finished among the top five in this year's Ballon d'Or rankings and probably has more Golden Gloves in her closet than real ones. TikTok and the covers of A-list fashion magazines are as much her kingdom as any penalty area. She has provided women's football fandom with almost as many electrifying X-rated memes as implausible saves. Her nickname is Mary Queen of Stops.

And one potentially game-altering blunder was going to haunt this person?

Never before has the scrutiny surrounding women's football been so bright and unforgiving, particularly in the upper echelons. With the recent NewCo announcement and UEFA's changes to European women's football, the glare is only set to metastasise. And fast.

Which makes Earps' interview a timely and salient reminder that women's footballers are not the unflappable, imperturbable influencers that they are increasingly demanded to be - nor should they be.

The women's game has never been so ubiquitously competitive, nor has the appetite for it been so insatiable.

Yet, in recent weeks, Earps has found herself dragged through the anarchic land of X's trial by jury after (allegedly) not stopping to visit loyal fans after finishing a match, or the slightly different direction the 30-year-old took as she and her teammates lined up ahead of kick-off against Bristol City. Her character has been prodded and poked.

Throughout it all, Earps has mostly maintained her impenetrably cool persona, forever equipped with a fierce profanity-laden release on the pitch when required, as she continues to cut herself one of the best in the goalkeeping business.

Wobbles have arisen, as they do in the top-flight of any sport. But Friday's events told the tale of an unrestrained overflow, the result of a build-up of demands from an increasingly exacting profile on and off the pitch that finally burst into a public moment of vulnerability.

Critics will (rightfully) point out that elevated levels of pressure (and thus scrutiny) are critical stepping stones if the women's game is ever going to be perceived as equal to the men's. Exponential growth comes with exponential pressures. That's the tax paid.

The converse of that is: Is the modern men's game really the pinnacle for which to strive? This soul-consuming, player-devouring pressure cooker which dedicates hours of carefully tailored, fury-stirring bandwidth to dissecting a single mistake from [insert this week's culprit here], before moving on to the next serving of footballing carrion to pick apart and leave to the faceless social media buzzards?

And all for the enjoyment of""¦ whom exactly? Us? The fans? The players? Is this really fun?

Women's football has been built on the premise that its players are relatable and accessible. This has never been truer than now as the game's biggest personalities and stars are shouldered with the responsibility of driving it forward as much on the pitch as off it.

Which is why players will stay behind to fulfil the legions of demands for autographs and photographs. They will do so with a smile. They will also play a full 90-minute game of competitive, high-stakes football. They might win, or they might lose. They might play awful or they might relish one of their greatest-ever games. They might get berated by their coaches or by themselves, or they might be named POTM.

Go beyond the post-match dressing room: players might be struggling at home, with family or friends, with a small cold or with deeper-rooted mental health, concerns that feel almost too blissfully normal and mundanely human to be attributed to our favourite England stars.

Which is why, instead, the expectation is that players will remain after the game, to sign autographs and give up shoes and shirts and their time and always, always smile.

Because that's the unspoken social contract they've signed into: be a footballer and an influencer. Be a two-pronged instant entertainment supplier who doesn't wilt under the pressure and stratospheric standards. And smile!

This ideal illusion ultimately leaves no space for the footballer to be a human: to be upset after a match and deal with intrusive thoughts away from the glaring spotlight; to perhaps just go home after a day's work and have a quiet one on the couch. Instead, thoughts pile up. Stress swells. And the game is worse for it.

Regional Governor Oleh Kiper said today that four children were among those wounded in the early-morning blasts, which severely damaged the historic Transfiguration Cathedral, in Odesa, Ukraine

Russian missiles struck a historic Orthodox cathedral today in a brutal airstrike that killed at least one person and wounded 22 others.

Moscow continued its attacks on the port city of Odesa, a key hub for exporting grain, after withdrawing from a wartime deal that allowed exports of crops through the Black Sea this week.

Kremlin tyrant Vladimir Putin had vowed to retaliate against Kyiv for an attack on the crucial Kerch Bridge linking Russia with the Crimean Peninsula last week.

Regional Governor Oleh Kiper said today that four children were among those wounded in the early-morning blasts, which severely damaged the historic Transfiguration Cathedral, a landmark Orthodox cathedral in the city.

Archdeacon Andrii Palchuk said: ""The destruction is enormous, half of the cathedral is now roofless.""

Cathedral workers scrambled to remove documents and valuable items from the building, which had been flooded by water by firefighters battling the blaze. Mr Palchuk said the damage was caused by a direct hit from a Russian missile.

Two people who were inside at the time of the strike were wounded.

Mr Kiper said six residential buildings - including several apartment blocks - had been destroyed. Some people were trapped in their apartments due to the devastation of the attack, which left rubble strewn in the street and damage to power lines.

""Odesa: another night attack of the monsters,"" Mr Kiper wrote on Telegram.

Svitlana Molcharova, 85, was rescued by emergency service workers but refused to leave her destroyed apartment after she received medical help.

""I will stay here,"" she said to the emergency service worker who advised her to leave.

Another resident, Ivan Kovalenko, 19, said: ""I woke up when the ceiling started to fall on me. I rushed into the corridor.""

He came to Odesa after fleeing the city of Mykolaiv when his house was destroyed.

""That's how I lost my home in Mykolaiv, and here, I lost my rented apartment,"" he said.

His ceiling partially collapsed, the balcony came off the side of the building, and all the windows were blown out.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Russian ""terrorists"" would ""feel this retaliation"".

He tweeted: ""Missiles against peaceful cities, against residential buildings, a cathedral... There can be no excuse for Russian evil. As always, this evil will lose. And there will definitely be a retaliation to Russian terrorists for Odesa. They will feel this retaliation.""

Earlier Russian attacks this week crippled significant parts of export facilities in Odesa and nearby Chornomorsk and destroyed 60,000 tons of grain, according to Ukraine's Agriculture Ministry.

Mr Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko were due to meet today in St Petersburg, two days after Moscow warned Poland that any aggression against its neighbour would be considered an attack on Russia.

Mr Lukashenko said that Wagner mercenaries, who went to Belarus after an aborted coup against Moscow, wanted to go west ""on an excursion to Warsaw, to Rzeszow"" in Poland, but that Belarus would not allow them to relocate.

""I am keeping them in central Belarus, like we agreed. ... We are controlling what is happening"" with Wagner, he said.

Brands like Charlotte Tilbury, Sol de Janeiro and Elemis are big pulls for this year's beauty advent calendars, but some products have been cropping up more than others

When it comes to the countdown to Christmas - 83 sleeps, if you were wondering - beauty advent calendars are one of the most popular ways to mark the days off throughout the festive period. Over the past two months, The Mirror have been taking a look at the biggest and best, from high end hauls to budget beauty buys, as well as the ones that will save you the most money.

But one thing we noticed while reviewing the countless contents of each one was that there are a few brands that crop up time and time again. It's no bad thing, that's for sure, it simply means they're popular with shoppers and are likely to entice you to purchase them.

What's more though, is that on some occasions, the exact same product was cropping up, from TikTok viral purchases to skincare sensations. So, we decided to go through the most popular beauty advent calendars for 2023 and analyse what's inside to see which brands and products are most commonly found.

Some of the brands I saw recurring in a number of calendars were social media approved Color Wow, Mirror reader fave Medik8, Malin and Goetz and Dermalogica, all of which appeared five times in 15 advent calendars, though the products did vary in each one. However, the viral Sol de Janeiro was also spotted five times, and on four occasions, it was of course the coveted Bum Bum Cream, starring in LookFantastic, Harvey Nichols, ASOS and Sephora's beauty calendar. I had expected this to be the most popular throughout, having noticed the name appearing over and over, but there were other brands and products more frequently popping up, including Elemis and OTO both featuring six times, while Aromatherapy Associates and Acqua di Parma appeared seven, the latter across four calendars.

It will come as no surprise that Charlotte Tilbury was one of the most commonly found brands and a real pull for many of the calendars. For example, a £45 eyeshadow palette appears in ASOS's £90 offering, making it a real star of the show. But the Hollywood glam brand also appears in Harrods in the form of a mascara, lipsticks in Harvey Nics and Fenwick, eyeshadow palettes in a further two and setting spray in Selfridges.

I often joke that Philip Kingsley appears in ""˜every beauty box ever' because I always seem to have Elasticizer coming out of my ears, and this year, the brand appears in eight calendars, though only three are Elasticizer products. The brand stars in five advent calendars, with the M&S option containing three bestsellers from the haircare collection alone. Dr. Barbara Sturm also appears in eight calendars, as does Sunday Riley, with four of their products being Good Genes, on par with the Bum Bum cream.

The most popular brand of all was REN Skincare, cropping up nine times throughout across eight calendars, coming in twice in the Boots Premium calendar, boasting overnight spot treatments, eye creams, AHA tonics and cleansing gels.

But the one product that brands seem to be using as a big draw is none other than The Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader. The brand cropped up seven times throughout - almost half of the calendars we looked at - and each and every time it was the exact same product: a 15ml sample of the coveted cream.

Here's every calendar where it features this year:

Liberty

Cult Beauty

Harvey Nichols

Harrods

Space NK

Selfridges

Fenwick

You'll notice that all of the above are what we consider to be the high end beauty advent calendars of 2023, and that's because The Rich Cream bumps up the value of these calendars quite dramatically, with this deluxe sample size being worth an eye watering £71. It's not the kind of money that people can justify spending on one item, least not before Christmas, but when included in a money-saving haul of products, it's a great way to snag it for less.

A revolutionary face cream is said to be inspired by 30 years of research and innovation, that patented 'Trigger Factor Complex' (TFC8) which ""˜unlocks a code' in your skin that repairs tissue. Considered a ""˜holy grail' by many, this formula is best-suited to those with normal to dry skin types and can help visibly reduce the signs of ageing and environmental damage.

Thunderstorms and heavy showers were forecasted for most of the UK on Monday, following a cold and grey weekend - but the Met Office has revealed there are signs of warmer things to come!

Monday's weather will likely follow a similar trajectory to Saturday and Sunday in the UK, weather maps revealed.

There will be heavy showers across almost all of the UK, and thunderstorms cropping up in northwestern regions.

The west coast of Scotland will likely be hit by the wall of rain first, peaking at about 10am.

At the same time, showers will start to appear in Wales and the North West of England.

Throughout the afternoon, the rain will move further east, hitting the Midlands, eastern Scotland, and even the south coast.

But most of the rain was forecast to fall at about 4pm, spread across almost all of England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and northern Scotland.

Up to 4mm of rain could fall within a three-hour period in the most affected areas, which included Aberystwyth, Stoke-on-Trent, Liverpool, Belfast, and the Shetland Islands, according to Ventusky maps.

Meanwhile, the Met Office forecasted heavy cloud cover and a wet start to Monday morning.

It tweeted: ""Increasing amounts of cloud through Monday morning, with heavy showers in the north and west.""

Thunder and lightning could strike the North West in mid-afternoon, added Ventusky maps.

The storms will gradually move further east throughout the early evening, ultimately ending out to sea at just before 10pm.

But, despite the doom and gloom, there are some early signs that summer is back on its way.

The UK could see a 28C scorcher by the weekend, gradually rising from 20C on Wednesday.

The Southeast could be particularly warm by the end of next week, according to the Met Office.

UK five-day weather forecast

This evening and tonight:

Showers easing slightly but persisting overnight in the west. A cloudy night for the Northern Isles with further outbreaks of rain. Drier elsewhere with clear spells. Remaining breezy.

Monday:

Another showery and blustery day, but with a greater extent of showers pushing into Wales and England. Showers merging into longer spells of rain at times, potentially heavy and thundery.

Outlook for Tuesday to Thursday:

Sunny spells and scattered showers for Tuesday and Wednesday, though more persistent rain possible in the south. More settled on Thursday, but cloud building in the west later. Less breezy.

Mercedes spent most of the 2022 season fixing problems with their W13 rather than actually developing the car, and will be desperate to avoid several more months of the same

Pre-season testing will not provide enough time on track for Mercedes to identify any major issues with their new car, according to their concerned technical director.

Mike Elliott and his team spent much of last year putting out fires and fixing issues on the W13, such as the porpoising problem which was destroying their season - and Lewis Hamilton's back.

The Silver Arrows - back in black for 2023 - will be desperate to avoid a repeat performance. But the W14 did not exactly get off to an auspicious start as it hit the Silverstone track for a demo run earlier this week, with a few ""niggles"" cropping up.

A shakedown the following day was more ""smooth"", the team reported, but still there will be some nervousness. Pre-season testing in Bahrain next week may throw up some more curveballs that Mercedes will at least be grateful to be aware of.

However, Elliott feels that, with just three days of running scheduled before the competitive action starts this year, there may be some gremlins lurking in the background which may not pop up until after the season has already begun.

""We never really got on top of the car balance last year,"" he said. ""All the normal work we do at the beginning of the season didn't happen because of the problems we were trying to rectify. With only three days of testing this year, that has two big impacts.

The first is in reliability - if we are not reliable in the test, then we will have very limited mileage to learn. We also won't be able to measure the car's absolute reliability too much, because over three days you are not going to get huge amounts of running. These cars are now so reliable that you need more mileage than three days to really start seeing some of the issues.

""The second big impact is that we've got to use our limited time as efficiently as possible. We've got to learn as much as we can, to work out how to get the most performance out of the car and what we can learn to feed into the next developments.""

But, on a more positive note, he later added: ""As we develop the car throughout the winter, we test as much as we can on rigs. We do everything we can to make sure that the car is reliable, and that the performance we expect is measured as best as we can.""

Gael Clichy appeared as a pundit for Manchester City's 3-1 win over Everton and made it clear that he still roots for his former club, despite them taking on Arsenal in the title race

Gael Clichy played for both Arsenal and Manchester City during his career, but it seems clear that he is rooting for the latter in the Premier League title race this season.

Clichy now works as an assistant coach to Thierry Henry with France under-21s, having taken the job in August. But the 38-year-old also appeared as a pundit on Amazon Prime Video's coverage of City's 3-1 win over Everton in the Premier League on Wednesday night.

He was booked by the broadcaster due to his affiliation with City, who he represented from 2011 to 2017 and helped to win two league titles. And it was clear from Clichy's choice of words that he retains love for his former club, with the word ""˜we' cropping up time and again when he spoke.

""I felt like this game was going to be the start of the season,"" Clichy said post-match. ""I really feel like this is the game we needed. Everybody was worried about coming here - a difficult stadium - but I felt it was the game the team needed""¦if you can perform well and win, the season can go on. I really hope I am right, and I really hope the second game can be won to get closer to Liverpool.""

Victory at Goodison Park came courtesy of a second-half fightback which saw Phil Foden, Julian Alvarez and Bernardo Silva score. It moved them fourth in the Premier League table - five points behind leaders Liverpool and three behind Arsenal, who can go back top when they host West Ham on Thursday night.

Clichy made his name at Arsenal, turning out 264 times between 2003 and 2011. The Frenchman helped Arsene Wenger 's side win the Premier League and FA Cup before City signed him for £7million amid a spending spree designed to take them to the next level.

Clichy no doubt has fond memories of his time in north London and gave his assessment of Mikel Arteta 's side back in August. Speaking to talkSPORT he said: ""It was a very good season for them, but you think the way City have been performing over the last 10 to 12 years, nobody was really surprised towards the end of the season. I will say that, with the signings they have done, Arsenal, are more equipped to go all the way.

""Can they cope with the pressure? Because being an outsider is always easier in a way. Now people are going to expect more. Last year, starting the season, finishing in the top four was the objective. Now they're starting the season as title contenders and that's a different story. I'm pretty sure they're going to do well.""

Dogs including the American bully, which have exaggerated features such as excessive skin folds and large, muscular frames, sell for more than £10,000 on social media sites

Gangsters are getting rich selling ""designer"" bulldogs for thousands of pounds, an animal welfare investigation revealed.

Dogs including the American bully, which have exaggerated features such as excessive skin folds and large, muscular frames, sell for more than £10,000 on social media sites.

They also often have the tops of their ears lopped off, a painful process known as ear cropping.

BBC Panorama reporter Sam Poling spent eight months investigating the dog-breeding underworld.

She identified a convicted ""county lines"" drug dealer who appeared to be selling American Bully puppies from prison.

Thomas Rayment, of Warrington, Cheshire, was jailed aged 30 in 2021 for running a heroin and crack cocaine gang.

His Facebook messenger account was used repeatedly to set up a deal with Ms Poling.

The account says he runs the UK arm of a major breeding business called Muscletone Bullys UK.

His business partner Ryan Howard said Rayment was brokering the deal from prison, although he later denied this when contacted by the BBC.

Mr Howard is not licensed to breed and sell dogs but in undercover footage, he told Panorama he had a ""huge network"" of around 120 dogs.

He explained that most are ""co-owns"", in which a dealer gets someone else to house the dog and pays them a percentage from its sale.

It means a dealer can have a network of dogs without the authorities having any idea how many they have.

In a statement, Muscletone Bullys UK said: ""Thomas Rayment does not communicate with anyone illegally and has others running his socials.""

An animal welfare investigator spoke about the connection between organised crime and extreme dog breeding.

The investigator, who did not want to be named, said: ""It's a massively lucrative trade. The big breeders""¦ the majority are criminals, drug dealers, organised crime gangs. It's exactly the same business model as selling drugs. But we're talking about dogs.""

Panorama identified another breeding business, not connected to organised crime, but producing English bulldogs with extreme features, even though the owners had recently been successfully prosecuted.

Karl Shellard, 44, and wife Victoria, 41, of Bonvilston, South Wales, were convicted of animal welfare offences and fined £19,000 each last year.

When the police raided their home they found 27 dogs. They were selling their extreme breed of English bulldogs for up to £20,000 each on social media.

The programme found the Shellards are still in business and Karl boasted of making up to £100,000 in one month.

Fans of Emily in Paris star Lucien Laviscount were shocked after it was revealed he had enjoyed a brief relationship with Kerry Katona when he was 19 years old

Fans of actor Lucien Laviscount were left in a state of shock after learning that the Emily in Paris cast member used to date Kerry Katona, who is 12 years older than him.

Currently known for his role as Alfie in the hit Netflix series, Lucien stars alongside Lily Collins, who plays main character Emily, as one of her love interests.

Following the success of his stint on the show, his name has recently been cropping up as one of the contenders for the role of the next James Bond.

However, one Twitter user got wind of the rumours and joked that Kerry could be a future Bond girl, reminding everyone about her and Lucien's former fling.

The pair met on Celebrity Big Brother in 2011, where the then 19-year-old Coronation Street and Waterloo Road actor, and the former Atomic Kitten star, then 31, hit it off.

Lucien and Kerry were seen kissing on the show on more than one occasion and were often filmed cuddling, before Lucien exited the series in fifth place.

Upon leaving the Big Brother house, Kerry and Lucien rekindled their relationship and posed together on the cover of OK! Magazine, the headline stating: ""We hope we'll be together forever"".

Kerry spoke to the publication about the connection she had with her 19-year-old lover.

She said: ""There was a lot of sexual tension, definitely. If the cameras hadn't been there, God knows what would have happened.""

Lucien didn't appear fazed about the couple's age gap, as he mentioned that he had a ""thing"" for older women.

He said: ""She's not too old for me! I like women who know where they're at.

""It's so frustrating to hear Kerry talk like that because she's amazing. When I'm with her, I don't feel like there's an age gap at all.""

Following the tweet that went viral, many other social media users weighed in on the former couple's relationship, with one writing: ""In 2011, Lucien Laviscount was 19, and Kerry Katona was 31.""

Another said: ""And I can't look at Lucien Laviscount without seeing his Celebrity Big Brother relationship with Kerry Katona.""

The magazine cover also went viral, on Instagram this time, with one user replying: ""2011??? He was 19 and she was 31""¦"".

The relationship wasn't meant to be, as things fizzled out not long after their cover page debut.

In a column for OK! Magazine, Kerry wrote: ""I love him but I'm not going to marry him,"" she wrote . ""I would never want to take his childhood away from him!""

Richard Armitage, who was one of the frontrunners to take on James Bond in the next film, has ruled himself out of playing the iconic role as he declared he would be too old

A James Bond frontrunner has declared he would be too old to play the iconic character.

Richard Armitage, who recently starred in Netflix's erotic thriller Obsession, has been rumoured to be taking on Bond for its next film. He has been one of the names in the running to take over from Daniel Craig after the actor stepped away from the role after his last film No Time To Die.

Ever since Craig has hung up his tuxedo, the hunt has been on to find the next actor to fill in 007's shoes. Having been played by Daniel Craig since 2006, a wide range of British actors have been rumoured to be taking on the role, including Richard.

However, during his appearance on Loose Women on Friday, Richard, 52, addressed the rumours once and for all. Host Kaye Adams asked: ""Are you still on the James Bond list?"" Richard replied: ""Apparenrtly I keep cropping up on this list,"" as Judi Love looked at Richard and said: ""This is giving a bit of James Bond and Dean.""

""Would you fancy it?,"" probed Kaye. Richard said: ""Do you know what, my little nephew every time I go home he is like 'are you going to be James Bond uncle Richard?' And I am like, no you have just read it in the papers. I think James Bond with a zimmer frame would be not apt. I would cast a guy in his 20s, but I would be up for playing a Bond villain.""

The next installment is tipped to hit the big screen as soon as 2025, with stars like Aaron Taylor-Johnson being the bookies' favourite. The 33-year-old actor has been a hot favourite to take on the role and is hitting screens in a new action film. He broke into the mainstream with the romcom film Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging before going on to play action roles in Kick Ass and later played Quicksilver in the Marvel film Avengers: Age of Ultron.

This year he was due to play adventurer Sergei Kravinoff in the Marvel film Kraven the Hunter - but the film release has been delayed until August 2024. Reports have suggested Aaron will soon be announced as the next Bond - while Oppenheimer and Batman Begins director Christopher Nolan is hotly tipped to direct the next film in the series.

Aaron was the bookies favourite to take over Bond in December last year - as reports claimed he had already filmed a test scene for bosses. A source said at the time: ""Aaron has impressed bosses so much that he has filmed one of the franchise's famous gun barrel teaser scenes, something all the Bond actors do. That move takes him a step closer to signing a deal. Bosses at the brand were really impressed with his unique blend of acting intensity and his impressive back catalogue of action films.""

The line between pet and food is often toed carefully for those who raise livestock but one woman crossed that line when she made a joke out of killing her chicken for attacking her daughter

Some animals are held in higher regard than others, especially when it comes to what counts as a pet and what counts as possible food. When an animal is called a pet we often attribute a personality and a connection to it unlike with animals we know will be used for meat.

One woman caused upset online as she crossed this boundary and turned her ""mean ole"" pet rooster into chicken nuggets as revenge for it attacking her child.

Magan Schmidt posted on her Facebook about the rooster's demise, which she said was due to the rooster turning on her daughter and almost blinding her.

Discover, learn, grow. We are Curiously. Follow us on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

In her controversial post, Magan wrote: ""Well, it finally happened. Our mean ole backyard rooster, HeiHei, attacked the baby child!!

""We were so lucky that he didn't do any more damage than he did. Half an inch, and she would have lost an eye!

""Nevertheless, he got what was coming to him! Mama don't play when it comes to her babies.

""HeiHei nuggets for dinner!""

The mum posted a picture of chicken nuggets frying in a pan to accompany the post, which appear to be the ""HeiHei nuggets"". Some felt this was an appropriate step, although others were less convinced.

One critic said: ""'It finally happened' really sounds like this isn't the first time your child has had a negative interaction with this roo protecting his coop.

""If you knew it was an issue, why didn't you do more to prevent it? Also to add, anyone that knows anything about raising chickens for livestock knows a full grown, adult cock is not food. At all.

""Protection is their only purpose.""

Another added: ""I know people eat chickens all the time, but killing it specifically because it attacked your child doesn't sit right with me when children are known to antagonise animals.""

Many people were telling Magan to ""teach the kid to not mess with them"" and that she should have had more control over the situation, knowing that the rooster was like.

""You control your circumstances (pets, children, household, wild animals you choose to possess) which means it's on you, not the animal,"" came another comment. ""Very sad.""

However, there were those who sided with Magan, saying: ""It's pretty easy to tell in the comments who has never been around mean roosters before! Some birds make better nuggets.""

One supporter said: ""Glad you got rid of the chicken.""

""We live in a soft world. If you didn't grow up on a farm or live like this, don't comment. It's life. Get over it,"" concluded a third.

The singer has purchased the construction to put in his garden for a space to continue his new painting hobby, taking inspiration from famed artist Jackson Pollock

Ed Sheeran will be spending a lot of time pottering in a pig shed this summer.

The singer has bought a livestock shelter to put in his garden for a space to continue his new painting hobby. The musician paints Jackson Pollock-style art works, and one previously sold for £51,000 at a charity auction.

""It's a big, corrugated iron warehouse and I'm going to paint art inside it - a pig shed, to paint in,"" Ed says. By the time he's splashed loads of paint around, the place will certainly look like a sty.

The star has evidently been on a spending splurge as he also reveals he has bought Peter Pan's outfit from the film Hook, as worn by Robin Williams, for £15,000 as well as a sword from another character from the film, Rufio. ""I like film props,"" he explains in a US interview.

Surprisingly however, he doesn't really own much of his own memorabilia, having auctioned most of that off for charity, except his suit from the Bad Habits video and the puppet version of Ed from the video for Sing.

""I sorta wish I'd hung on to some of it,"" he admits. Although he'd have had to install another shed at his £3.7million Suffolk estate, to keep it all in.

Rawkee Hunt was playing when her sister when her dad had just finished burning the overgrown grass from the roadway and fence lines when she wandered into the hot embers

A 4-year-old girl has been left covered in fourth degree burns across her body after wandering into grass burnt by her dad.

Rawkee Hunt, now 7, was playing with her 1-year-old sister, Martina, now 4, when their dad, Shay Hunt, had just finished burning the overgrown grass from the roadway and fence lines.

The 31-year-old, who carries out this task to prevent his livestock from running through a fence, was carrying out the job on February 3, 2020 when he had two of his daughters in the car.

Once the fires had burned down into embers he let the girls out while he cleaned his tools and loaded them into the truck.

Rawkee wandered into the area that had just been burned and the wind suddenly shifted and pushed the hot embers into a patch of grass that had not been completely burned.

This caused a strand of grass to ignite and suddenly pushed hot flames five-feet into the air. Rawkee was standing behind this strand of grass and the heat of the burning grass pushed into her causing her clothing and skin to start to melt.

Shay was able to quickly remove her and her clothing in order to prevent further injury to the little girl.

Her father rushed her from the scene in in Utah, US, and into town in his farm truck, where he then met his wife Megan, they transferred Rawkee to her much cleaner car and raced to the hospital.

Rawkee arrived at the hospital in a state of shock, upon arrival the hospital placed her in a medically induced coma for six days.

Rawkee's mother, salon owner Megan Hunt, 31, explained how her seven-year-old daughter has already had well over 100 surgeries since the accident, with at least that many more to come, according to medics.

""On February 3rd 2020 our lives changed in an instant,"" she said.

""My husband Shay was working on our remote farm, located about 20 miles from the nearest city.

""Each winter we burn the overgrown grass from the road ways and fence lines, so livestock doesn't run through a fence they cannot see in the springtime.

""While doing this job on this February day, my husband had our two young daughters in the truck (Rawkee, 4 and Martina, 1).

""Once the fires had burned down into embers, he let the girls out while he cleaned his tools and loaded them into the truck.

""Rawkee wandered into the area that had just been burned and the wind suddenly shifted and pushed the hot embers into a stand of grass that had not been burned.

""This caused the stand of grass to ignite and pushed hot flames over five-feet into the air.

""Rawkee was standing behind this stand of grass and the heat of the burning grass pushed into her causing her clothing and skin to start to melt.

""Her daddy was able to quickly remove her and her clothing in order to prevent further damage.

""32% of Rawkee's body was burned. Areas include her entire face, tops of both hands, underneath of her left arm and left rib cage, fronts and backs of both of her legs and also right rib cage.

""She suffered deep third and fourth degree burns, Rawkee's daddy Shay saved her.

""My husband ran to her when she started to scream and started pulling her clothing off as quickly as possible as they were melting into her skin.

""Her face was also melting as it took the most heat.

""She immediately went into shock and he drove the 30 minutes into town. I met him about five miles outside of town and we loaded her into my car, it was much cleaner than the farm truck.

""We then ran her into the local hospital where she was placed into a medical coma for the next six days.""

Rawkee has been in recovery for two-and-a-half years; she has had over 100 surgeries and due to her body not responding traditionally to treatment the family had to begin tissue expansion treatment.

""Rawkee has had well over 100 surgeries with at least that many more to go,"" said Megan

""Unfortunately Rawkee's body didn't respond to traditional healing methods commonly used for burn survivors.

""Her body developed aggressive keloid scars that soon travelled over many areas over her body and majorly affected the structure of her face and joints.

""We were referred to a plastic surgeon who had a clever plan to expand the few areas of healthy skin that remained on Rawkee's body.

""By expanding her healthy skin we could remove the scar build up and resurface these areas with healthy skin. Essentially removing a large area scar for a much smaller line scar.

""The process has been a huge journey and very painful. The tissue expanding balloons were placed underneath her skin above her tissue in April 2021. Then we have to allow the body time to accept the expanders before we start the weekly injection process.

""Once the body accepts the expanders we do weekly injections with a large needle poked into her ports that are located below her skin. The expanders take about three-months to completely expand.

""The fuller they get the more pressure and limited mobility Rawkee receives. We then schedule removal surgery and resurface with the new skin created.

""These surgeries generally last 8-15 hours and task Rawkee's little body immensely.

""Our hope in this journey is to restore mobility and allow her body to grow at a normal rate without the restraint of the scars and banding.""

Rawkee is incredibly brave and as confident as ever but that unfortunately does not stop the staring in the street or the probing questions from other children.

""Many people look at her with distasteful looks from a complete misunderstanding of what she has been through,"" said Megan.

""We have found that it's people's lack of knowledge that leads to rudeness.

""It's very common for children to rudely ask ""what is wrong with your face"" but Rawkee has a very bold and grounded mindset and doesn't allow these questions to affect her.

""It hasn't affected Rawkees confidence, if anything I would say it has increased it.

""Rawkee's mindset is absolutely incredible. She never has a bad day. Sometimes she will have a hard moment but never lets it get her down for long.

""She stays physically, spiritually and mentally active with daily prayer/meditation, dance, gymnastics, arts and crafts, singing and playing the piano.

""She gives all she has to be positive and keep a bright outlook that everything happens for a reason and every pain has a purpose.""

The family has also seen incredible kindness in these trying times, even from strangers.

""We have had many incredible individuals and organisations join together to provide so much support and healing for Rawkee,"" said Megan.

""Many money donations have been made to help support her immense medical debts. Many cards, gifts and kindnesses have been sent her way that have provided healing and comfort.

""Most of all Rawkee has been blessed with the most incredible medical team of men and women who give so much to help her on her path of healing and recovery.

The catastrophic wildfires, fuelled by winds from Hurricane Dora, ripped through the historic town of Lahaina on the north west of Maui, claiming 99 lives so far as over 1,000 remain missing

'Highly flammable' invasive plants from abandoned plantations may have caused the Maui fire which decimated parts of the Hawaiian island last week.

The wildfires ripped through the historic town of Lahaina on the north west of Maui, claiming 99 lives so far as it tore through homes, businesses, cars and a harbour packed with boats. Hurricane Dora winds battering the island fuelled the flames across the region as emergency services struggled to control the raging blaze.

Researchers are now looking at how the fire became so powerful - with the disaster officially recorded as the worst US wildfire in 100 years. While the official death toll stands at 99, experts fear that number could increase in the coming days as search and rescue operations continue.

Experts claim a non-native plant brought to the island could have contributed to the rapid and deadly spread of the island, with much of the brushland made up of guinea grass, molasses grass and buffel grass - introduced to the Hawaiian islands from Africa in the 18th century by European ranchers looking for a steady supple of drought-resistant livestock forage.

However, as sugar plantations and much farming land were abandoned - the final sugar cane plantation closing in 2016 - the grasses were left untended before growing rapidly across the island. In summer, the dry and arid landscape and scorching temperatures make the grasses highly flammable.

In 2018, fires broke out on West Maui and destroyed 21 homes, in part due to these non-native grasses. After that disaster, one of the island's most prominent fire experts, University of Hawaii plant ecologist Clay Trauernicht published a letter claiming ""all that grass"" could fuel future incidents. In 2021, a Maui County report also warned about the rampantly spreading shrubbery and called for its reduction, reports the New York Times.

Trauernicht claims the scorched grass after a rampant wildfire can lead to further risk of secondary disaster, as the hardy and opportunistic non-native grasses become the first to quickly grow back. On twitter he wrote: ""Yes many parts of Hawai'i are trending towards dryer conditions, BUT the fire problem is mostly attributable to the vast extents of non-native grasslands left unmanaged by large landowners as we've entered a 'post-plantation era' starting around the 1990s

""Hawai'i firefighters have been telling me for several years they're seeing fires burn hotter and faster than in the past - and I trust their knowledge. But fire and land use histories tell us fallow lands and grassy fuels are the key issue - and one we can deal with locally.""

An investigation is now underway to look into why so many survivors said they did not hear sirens before the fire was on top of them, despite an early-warning system consisting of 400 sirens in place. ""There was no warning,"" said Lynn Robinson, who lost her home.

Spokesperson Adam Weintraub from the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency said alerts were sent to phones, televisions and radio stations. It is not clear if these alerts were sent before widespread power cuts and mobile phone cell towers were taken out by the fires.

The Las Vegas Grand Prix festivities began on Wednesday night with an opening ceremony which did little to hype up this weekend's race and did a lot more to anger Max Verstappen

A different American city - the same pomp and pageantry which blighted proceedings in Miami.

The Las Vegas Grand Prix weekend officially began on Wednesday with a 30-minute opening ceremony. If you didn't catch it, think of the quadrennial show to kick off the Olympic Games but smaller, shorter and much, much more pointless.

For starters, it happened 72 hours before the actual race. The WWE-style ceremony introducing all 20 drivers to the crowd at the Miami Grand Prix earlier this year was painful enough, but at least it happened just before the action began and so served a purpose.

Most of the drivers hated that too but participated nonetheless. And the same was true in Las Vegas as they were all presented like livestock to the crowd on the pit straight off the new street track, the construction of which has infuriated pretty much every resident and business owner within a large radius.

Not that many of them enjoyed it. As Lance Stroll pointed out, they're ""not Hollywood stars"". Max Verstappen was more blunt when he declared he felt like ""a clown"" and dead right when he dubbed this whole weekend ""99 per cent show, and one per cent sporting event"".

Defending F1's corner has been Lewis Hamilton, who spoke highly of the Miami mess and came out in support of the Vegas race too. ""I hear there's a lot of people complaining about the direction that Stefano [Domenicali, F1 chief executive] and Liberty have been going, but I think they've been doing an amazing job.""

Sorry Lewis, here comes some complaining. But it's because of genuine concern for the sport's future. These moves to build more hype and keep the attention of F1's new generation of fans for more than a few seconds come at the risk of alienating the sport's core support.

That could be of huge detriment to F1's future. Liberty Media and Domenicali have to be applauded for the steps they have taken in recent years to grow the popularity of the sport the world over. It has arguably never been more healthy and it makes complete sense that chiefs are cashing in on that. Make hay while the sun shines, as they say.

Catch all the action from Formula One on Sky Sports and get exclusive access to races, qualifying and much more for every Grand Prix. From Max Verstappen to Lewis Hamilton, you won't miss a lap on Sky Sports.

And the growth figures are impressive. Nielsen data suggests one in three F1 fans started following the sport in the last four years, while F1 enjoyed faster digital followers growth than any other sport in 2022. In the US, average TV viewership is up while three of the four largest ever live race audiences were recorded this year - in a season with no title intrigue whatsoever.

But for how long is the sun going to shine? For how long at those new fans brought into F1 by Drive to Survive and that 2021 title battle between Verstappen and Hamilton going to remain interested? If one team keeps winning as easily as Red Bull have this year, it's easy to see many of the fair-weather fans switching off.

However, if F1 alienates its core support in the meantime, what will it be left with if those newer fans do lose interest? That is what the sport must bear in mind. Clearly, by the fact that these off-putting stunts keep getting the green light, it hasn't been considered nearly enough.

Around 45 percent of dogs show signs of fear when they hear fireworks, while some have literally been scared to death. Do you think they should be banned?

With Bonfire Night just around the corner, many pet owners are taking measures to prepare their animal for firework season - and we want to know what YOU think.

According to the RSPCA, the charity received 11,785 reports of animals in distress due to fireworks between October and January 2021. Around 68 percent of reports were animals impacted by private at-home backyard displays, which makes it ""impossible for neighbours to prepare their pets, horses and livestock properly"".

In fact, 94 percent of those who reported didn't have notice of firework displays nearby, while 19 percent saw animals in distress as a result of antisocial behaviour. In many cases, animals can hurt themselves in reaction to the noise and flashes, which can sometimes cause death. This is because dogs hear twice as many frequencies than humans which means firework spectacles are much louder for them.

The RSPCA data found that 69 percent of UK adults take at least one measure to help their pet relax during the explosive season, with many opting to play classical music. Studies have revealed that around 45 percent of dogs - that's around 5.5 million in the UK - show signs of fear when they hear fireworks. Meanwhile, chickens huddling together out of fear can smother one another to death.

Last year, the Humane Society International urged revellers to make a ""small sacrifice"" to reduce the suffering of thousands of animals. Executive director Claire Bass said: ""As people delight in bright colours lighting up the skies, thousands of owners try to comfort their dogs, cats, horses and other companion animals who feel threatened and overwhelmed by the unpredictable booms and crackles. Each year we hear from devastated owners of furry companions who have literally been scared to death.""

Her comments came after nearly 50,000 people signed a petition to ban the sale of fireworks to the public, though Parliament ultimately decided it wouldn't change the law. They responded with: ""The Government has no current plans to ban the sale of fireworks to the public but continues to monitor the situation. We believe the majority of individuals use fireworks safely and appropriately.""

Under the current law, adults over 18 can buy fireworks from registered sellers for private use from October 15 to November 10. You can also purchase them from 26 to 31 December and three days before Diwali and Chinese New Year. At other times you can only buy fireworks from licensed shops.

While the RSPCA is calling for tighter regulations to protect our pets, we want to know if you think fireworks should be banned? Vote in our poll HERE to have your say.

If life isn't harsh enough for the animals of Kenya, their plight has been worsened by the longest drought in the country for 20 years

It is every mother's worst nightmare and her fraught cries reveal her pain. Her baby is missing. Kuleta the cheetah paces around, calling out for the little one.

Her other three cubs take their cue from their mother, scanning the dry savanna from dusk until dawn.

Kuleta searches for two excruciating days, before arriving full circle back where the little one last went missing.

It has become obvious Kuleta's infant was killed by lions under nightfall, and it has now been days since the other cubs have had any food.

If life isn't harsh enough for the animals of Kenya, their plight has been worsened by the longest drought the country has experienced in 20 years.

""It was really unprecedented in recent Kenyan history,"" says Dino Martin, a Kenyan scientist and evolutionary biologist.

""Even though these landscapes and savannas are very much adapted to seasonality, to have wet seasons and dry seasons, and even to have droughts, the scale and the length of this drought has not been recorded before. And so the impact on wildlife, on people, on livestock has been tremendous.""

It could have been a tragic ending for the rest of the cheetah family but suddenly both humidity and hope builds in the air. Kuleta kills a gazelle, enough to feed herself and the cubs. As the family gather to feast, a couple of drops of rain begin to fall.

The young cheetah mother's perseverance to look after her young in the parched lands is shown on Sky Nature docu-series Chasing the Rains, which airs tomorrow night on Sky Nature.

The show follows the stories of three animal matriarchs - Kuleta, a wild dog, and a family of elephants - as they strive to protect their families in the Kenyan wild and battle the elements with a serious lack of water.

Dino adds: ""In the last 10 years, we have had four major droughts. This is a direct result of climate change.

""And climate change is driven in part by human activity and it's also a result of the degradation of the environment in northern Kenya. And that includes over-grazing and all these other things. We're seeing changes in new highways and clearing of habitat.""

The elephant family in the series, named the Royals, also suffers from the lack of rainfall. On average an elephant needs to drink at least 180 litres of water a day and bathing is important for them in order to preserve their levels of hydration because they can't sweat to cool down like humans.

It has left their lives at risk, and when the Royals find the Samburu river has dried up to just a snake of sand, they find a way to survive. The elephants excavate wells by digging in the sand, uncovering a water source not only for the family but other animals too.

""Kenya has lost a lot of elephants to drought,"" says Dino. ""But we're also seeing an intensified conflict between elephants and people. Elephants are also coming in to raid people's homesteads because of the disappearance of the forage and there's a little bit of food available there.

""An elephant has to eat lots and lots of food every day, hundreds of kilos but it has just not been available.

""So elephants have been either forced to move into areas where they are in more direct contact with people and also elephants are starving.

""It's really remarkable that these animals which have lived for millions of years on the savannas are facing a very dire future, because of the changes that we've brought about in the world.

""Even though there's space for the elephants and they can move across the landscape, and they do, there hasn't been enough for them to eat.

""And so elephants have been forced to feed on trees and their bark, and not feed on the grasses and the bushes and the shrubs that they normally would have, because they aren't available.""

Wild dog matriarch Phoenix navigates life with her five young cubs joining her pack of 17.

Her breed is at the brink of extinction not just due to drought - which has exacerbated problems and led to higher levels of stress for animals - but also because it has heightened the conflict between people and wildlife.

""What has happened for example with the wild dogs,"" explains Dino, ""is that disease has spread from domestic animals to wild species.""

Canine distemper caught from domestic dogs almost wiped out wild dogs, leaving just a few individuals. But Phoenix and her pack are a sign that they are making a comeback.

""It just shows how much more responsible we need to be in terms of our stewardship of the species and these landscapes,"" says Dino.

However, with wild dogs and cheetahs there is also risk that the conflict over water and space damages other species, such as gazelles and hares.

""As these start declining it causes a lot of stress,"" says Dino. ""Like all predators they might decide to turn to livestock which creates another conflict.""

Despite the fact that there are many conservation efforts taking place in Kenya, Dino hopes the series will make people think positively about animals.

""I would love for people to take away that it is so wonderful that we still have this wildlife. And it belongs not just to Kenya, but the whole world. And we as humanity, people in England and Kenya, can make a difference. We can make the right choices to keep this remarkable life around us. It's investing in our future. If we don't look after mother nature, she'll come and teach us lessons.""

Andy Lines spoke to grief-stricken villages in Lomirok, Kenya, facing the worst drought since Live Aid

Within seconds of walking into the remote village of Lomirok everyone had a story to tell of death.

The impact of the drought is everywhere.

I met a dad who had lost his 14-year-old daughter, a husband who lost his wife and a woman who'd lost her seven-year-old grandson.

They were deeply upset but their own personal situations were completely ""normal"".

All the villagers had similar accounts and they queued patiently to tell me.

Just outside the village perimeter I was taken to the makeshift graveyard.

The latest grave was that of a 53-year-old mum who had died just six weeks ago.

Piles of rocks and stones had been carefully placed to cover her final resting place.

Branches and twigs were placed on top to try and keep the hyenas away.

Carcasses of once precious livestock littered the area.

They were left where they fell dying of starvation and thirst.

I could see a sheep's skull, the ribcage of a calf and the legbone of a goat.

A donkey, which can only have died two days before, lay on the floor.

There's not enough food and water for human beings so the animals have no chance of survival.

Children played in and among the skeletons.

They were painfully thin but were now getting some food from the Red Cross.

A temporary school had been set up.

For some of the kids the pink shirt they wore was their only item of clothing.

In the next village I was taken to the ""maternity unit where the babies are delivered.""

It consisted of an outside ""room"".

The ""walls"" and the three beds were made from branches lashed together.

Africa food crisis - how to help

The British Red Cross has an appeal to raise money to help.

Because of the war in Ukraine and the earthquake in Turkey and Syria, the drought has dropped off the public's radar.

A ""famine"" has not yet officially been declared but the sheer numbers of people dying brings back terrible memories of 1984/85.

Richard Blewitt, executive director of international for the British Red Cross, said: ""The Africa food crisis is a catastrophic, deadly emergency on a scale we haven't seen in recent history. Right now, more than 140 million people are struggling without the food they need to survive.

""But there is hope, with the right support and more investment from governments we can get help to where it's desperately needed.

""We know that money is tight for many people here in the UK, but if you are able to give what you can, our Red Cross teams on the ground can reach communities with life-saving aid and help build long-term solutions.""

Lomirok is a gruelling 12 hour drive from the bustling capital Nairobi - it is closer to the Ethiopian border.

The village is just an example of the tragedy which is befalling the region.

How can this be happening in 2023?

223,"Chernobyl survivor warns of 'very high risk' of nuclear disaster as Russians fight","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/chernobyl-survivor-warns-very-high-29835820","Chernobyl survivor warns of 'very high risk' of nuclear disaster as Russians fight

As Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine rumbles on, fears are growing among Chernobyl survivors about another nuclear disaster which would cause mayhem for Europe and the world

Survivors of the world's worst nuclear disaster have said they fear history may repeat itself at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia plant.

Mykhaylo Khrushchenko, a native of the Chernobyl region, remembers waking up on April 26, 1986, to an eerily quiet home.

The 71-year-old tells the Mirror: ""Not only was there silence but somehow it was cold in my soul. I went out of the house, saw my neighbour and asked her: 'What is it, why aren't the children going to school?' She replied: 'There was an explosion at the nuclear power plant.'""

The Chernobyl disaster forced Mykhaylo, his family and hundreds of thousands of others to leave their homes. Some never returned.

The United Nations believes the radiation caused some 5,000 cases of thyroid cancers. Millions of acres of forest and farmland were contaminated, livestock was born deformed and humans continue to suffer long-term negative health effects.

And now as Russian President Putin's invasion of Ukraine rumbles on, fears are growing about another disaster as forces exchange fire near another plant.

Speaking from Ukraine on International Chernobyl Disaster Remembrance Day, Professor Yevgen Yakovlev told the Mirror that the threat of Russia's occupation of Zaporizhzhya poses a ""very high"" risk.

Before Chernobyl imploded, Professor Yakovlev was researching and analysing contamination of groundwater, vegetation and bottom sediments.

He found that thermal contamination was coming from unit four (the ultimate site of the disaster): ""At the end of 1985, we found that the temperature under the 4th block had risen by about 16 degrees: instead of 12, it was already 28 degrees.""

A month before the disaster, he presented his findings to the Central Committee of the Communistic Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow and was told his data was false.

Professor Yakovlev tells the Mirror: ""Moscow told me that I was an enemy of nuclear power development in the USSR. They said there was 'no time to deal with sh*t like me.'""

This week, the British Ministry of Defence warned that Russian troops have established ""sandbag fighting positions"" on buildings housing reactors at the nuclear plant.

It said: ""The move highly likely increases the chances of damage to ZNPP safety systems if fighting takes place around ZNPP.""

Dr Mark Wenman, Senior Lecturer in the Centre for Nuclear Materials and Department of Materials at Imperial College London, tells the Mirror that the act of taking a nuclear power station and making it a defensive military position is in direct violation of the Geneva Convention.

But he also says the reactors at Zaporizhzhia are of a different kettle of fish to Chernobyl's and there would be no release of radioactive material outside of the containment buildings.

According to Dr Wenman, the worst-case comparable scenario is the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania, US. This disaster saw large portions of the nuclear reactor core melt, which released radiation but caused no deaths or harm.

Dr Wenman says: ""I don't, in my wildest dreams, envisage anything happening on a significant scale [at Zaporizhzhia] that would endanger the lives of even the local inhabitants.""

Radiation from Chernobyl poisoned whole villages and the memories are still painful 37 years later.

Mykhaylo ended up working as the head of the union in Chernobyl for disabled people and in 2021, he was awarded the state order ""For Service"" by the decree of President Zelensky.

He says: ""Every year the date is a disaster for me. It is not the start of spring, but a disaster. Chernobyl is my homeland, my father's house is still there. I don't know what happened to it during the war.""

In March, after the plant first came under attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sent a message to the Russians: ""You know the word ""˜Chernobyl'.""

Keir Giles, the author of Russia's War on Everybody, tells the Mirror: ""You've got to wonder what is going through the heads of Russian soldiers preparing to be shot at while sitting on top of nuclear reactors.

""The tragic reality is that, just as with Chernobyl over 30 years before, it is not Russia itself but its neighbours Ukraine and Belarus that would bear the brunt of the devastating consequences of a nuclear accident.

""It's just another sign of how Russia's behaviour in its war on Ukraine is an insult not just to any civilised standards of human behaviour, but to common sense.""

Will Young won over Love Island fans thanks to his dance moves on last night's show, but some viewers think they've spotted a 'red flag' from the hunky farmer

Love Island fans think they've spotted Will Young's 'huge red flag'.

The farmer received a huge wave of support from ITV2 viewers during the second episode of this year's series in South Africa, after he got off to a rocky start before arriving in the villa thanks to backlash from PETA and animal lovers.

But despite some viewers warming to Will, 23, thanks to his hilarious attempt at dancing, many noticed his potential 'red flag' during the first update from the villa.

The hunky farmer was chatting with Olivia Hawkins, 27, and getting to know his new partner, after being put together by default, when his 'worrying' tattoo was revealed.

As the two islanders sat on beanbags, Olivia revealed she was a ""clean sheet"" when it comes to body art before Will revealed he has a tiny letter 'P' etched on his ankle.

""Is that a girl's initial?"" Olivia asked Will as he showed off his small inking.

""Yeah, that I met on holiday,"" the farmer began to explain.

Stunned, Olivia replied: ""Wait, you've got another girl's initial on your ankle? Why did you tell me that?

""You should have lied.""

Will went on to point out ""you can't start a relationship on a lie"" and added: ""I sometimes say, if I lie it would only get out.""

Love Island fans watching at home were just as shocked as Olivia when it came to Will's tattoo tribute.

""Oh,Will! Why would you bring up the tattoo on Episode 1 #LoveIsland,"" one mused on Twitter, as another wrote: ""BIG RED FLAG WILL #LoveIsland.""

""'I didn't wanna start the relationship off on a lie' 'I'd get the tattoo removed for you' Will you've known her 5 secs - calm it,"" a third declared.

Another added: ""Will is not a real person PLS the entire conversation about the tattoo has me WHEEZING #LoveIsland.""

Some found the farmer's tattoo tribute sweet, with one viewer tweeting: ""Will having another girls name as a tattoo bless him! #loveisland.""

Will - who has over 1million followers on TikTok - said before going into the villa: ""Having grown up on a farm, it's been quite difficult juggling relationships and work. Love Island will give me time away from the farm to solely go out and find love.

""I think I'm at the time of my life where I'm mature enough to go and find a wife.""

Farmer Richard Harrison and his wife Rachel, 59 and 54, were found dead in their home in Saddington, Leicestershire, of gunshot wounds, leading to tributes from shocked neighbours

Tributes have been paid to a ""lovely"" farmer and his wife found shot dead at their home, as police begin investigations.

Officers from Leicestershire Police were called to the home Smeeton Road, Saddington, at around 11.30am on Friday, December 15, by paramedics from the East Midlands Ambulance Service following reports the remains of a man and a woman had been discovered. Police have now named them as 59-year-old Richard Harrison and his wife, 54-year-old Rachel Harrison.

A post-mortem examination carried out confirmed both died from gunshot injuries. Investigating detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection to their deaths. Meanwhile, shocked neighbours have paid tribute to the much-loved couple.

One told the Sun: ""They were a lovely and decent couple and our hearts go out to their family. ""It is a terrible thing to happen, really shocking, and has upset so many of us at a time when we should all be looking forward to celebrating Christmas with loved ones.""

One friend said the couple had ""seemed so together"", commenting ""I am finding it all very shocking and hope their family are getting all the support they need."" Another added their deaths were the ""worst thing"" to have ever happened in the village, which has around 300 residents.

The couple are believed to have had two children together. Mr Harrison is also survived by three children from a previous marriage. The couple ran a cattle farm and delivered eggs locally , while Mrs Harrison was also the district commissioner of her local branch of the Pony Club.

Detective Inspector David Greenhalgh, from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit major crime team, said: ""This is a deeply tragic incident and officers are continuing to support the family during this extremely difficult time.

""We will continue to carry out enquiries to establish the full circumstances surrounding this incident, but I can confirm we do not believe anyone else was involved in the incident and a file will be prepared for H.M. Coroner.""

Farmer Kim Rendall drove with husky dog Daisy tied to the back of his car before he dumped her to die. Judge Michael Longman said the dog suffered 'dreadful' injuries

A cruel farmer who dragged his husky dog along a road by a rope tied to his car boot was handed a suspended jail sentence today.

Kim Rendall was caught on dashcam driving with Daisy tied to the back of his car before he dumped her to die - while he went home for a cup of tea and a haircut. At Bristol Crown Court Rendall, who wept in the dock, admitted two charges of causing unnecessary suffering by failing to protect an animal from pain and injury by dragging her behind the car, and failing to get urgent veterinary attention.

Rendall claimed the large white dog must have fallen or jumped out of the unlatched boot of the small car which had left him ""devastated and shocked"". Judge Michael Longman said to him: ""I don't believe you were devastated. Your attitude and behaviour was false. Daisy's injuries were truly dreadful.""

He said Rendall acted in an ""arrogant"" way and with ""disdain' but said Rendall did not intend to drag the dog down the road but was reckless about causing the dog pain, injury and suffering. The judge said he obstructed police and failed to take any steps to get the dog veterinary help.

Several drivers witnessed the horrific incident and tried to stop the 65-year-old by flashing their lights and sounding their horns at his red Nissan Micra. Daisy was left dreadfully injured in the April incident and was put to sleep nine days later.

But callous Rendall refused to help the dog or tell police where he had dumped Daisy when they turned up at his mother's home to find him drinking tea and having his hair cut by his sister. The RSPCA released the video showing Daisy being dragged for 55 seconds and 200 metres along the road in Timsbury near Bath, with one lady driver shouting 'your dog, your dog' out of a window, as Rendall gestured for her to go away with his hand.

Rendall only stopped when a dog walker flagged him down - with nine-year-old Daisy lying on the road bleeding out before struggling to her shredded feet. The lady dog walker ""pleaded"" with him to call a vet and she offered to pay the bill - but Rendall ""completely blanked"" her before he laughed and aggressively shouted ""alright my love"".

She said she was calling the police and Rendall said: ""I will do what I want. It's my dog."" The heartless farmer then lifted the injured dog into the car boot and drove off.

The police were called and went to the car owner's address - his 90-year-old mother's home - but Rendall refused to say where Daisy was and told them he would get his own veterinary care for her. He was arrested on suspicion of animal cruelty and 18 police officers and a drone unit were used to locate Daisy as rude and aggressive Rendall smirked in his police interview.

As he was handcuffed he said: ""It's all right. I'm going to take it to the vets."" Two and a half hours later, Daisy was found in a nearby cow barn in the Somerset countryside still tethered by the rope to the neck.

Rendall said in a statement to police that he was ""completely shocked and devastated"" and claimed it was ""completely unintentional and an accident"". He claimed Daisy must have jumped or fallen from the car boot without his knowledge on the journey and he had not deliberately dragged her along the road.

Police officers were left shocked and one of them, PC Natalie Cosgrove, said: ""I couldn't sleep and cried. I just felt incredibly sorry for her, that a human let her down so badly. This is one of those jobs that will haunt me forever.""

Rendall, who had no previous convictions, said he has been a smallholding farmer for 40 years and loved domestic and wild animals and had taken on ""good-natured but boisterous"" Daisy from his son ten years ago. Prosecutor Gregory Gordon asked for a long animal ban because Rendall refused to tell police where Daisy was and had no intention of getting her veterinary care.

Defence barrister Charles Row KC said Daisy tended to run off and was used to being on a long rope attached to her dog collar, and said on that day ""very deaf"" and ""abrupt"" Rendall was not wearing his hearing aids. ""It did not occur to him that Daisy either jumped or fell out of the boot. The boot was never latched,"" added the lawyer who said Rendall did not know he was towing her along the road.

Rendall was jailed for eight months, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. He was banned from keeping animals for 20 years except for his cattle and koi carp. He was ordered to pay £5,000 costs.

227,"PS Plus October 2023 games leak - The Callisto Protocol and Farming Simulator 22 on the way","https://www.mirror.co.uk/gaming/breaking-ps-plus-leak-october-31033465","PS Plus October 2023 games leak - The Callisto Protocol and Farming Simulator 22 on the way

This info comes from PS Plus leaker Billbil_kun who has a fantastic track record with leaking the Essential games.

PS Plus Essential has leaked ahead of the official reveal later this week, with The Callisto Protocol and Farming Simulator 22 on the way to subscribers.

The PS Plus Essential October 2023 lineup has been leaked out by the usual suspects, with 2022's spiritual successor to Dead Space - The Callisto Protocol - pegged to make its way to the service, just in time for Halloween. The title released last year to middling reviews, but was praised for its visuals and extremely gross death animations.

There's also the decidedly less spooky Farming Simulator 22, which will let you live out the farming life - without all the smells and textures involved in real life farming.

PS Plus leaker Billbil_kun, posted onto French outlet Dealabs to confirm the incoming titles. Considering Billbil_kun's track record in the past, we're almost certain this is legitimate, and that players can expect The Callisto Protocol and Farming Simulator 22 to be announced for PS Plus Essential tomorrow.

These titles - provided the leak is true - will become available on Tuesday, October 3 at 10am BST / 5am EDT / 2am PDT, and remain on the service for the entire month until Tuesday, November 7.

The PS Plus October 2023 lineup for the base, Essential tier is getting officially unveiled tomorrow, Wednesday, September 27 at the the usual time of 4:30pm BST / 11:30am EDT / 8:30am PDT. It'll be the first PS Plus Essential offering since the PS Plus price increase, which was announced alongside one of the worst months ever for Essential subscribers. Members were given PS4 titles Generation Zero and Black Desert - Traveler Edition, alongside Saints Row for PS4 and PS5.

The leaked PS Plus October 2023 games have proven our predictions for next month wrong; we guessed that Dark Souls Remastered and devilish platformer Cuphead would be on the cards, alongside the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection, to name a few. We may still be able to mark off a couple of our guesses on the PS Plus bingo card when the Extra and Premium games are announced, so we're not counting ourselves out just yet.

With Halloween on the way, The Calisto Protocol is a fitting to the PS Plus library. It's a sci-fi horror and if you've played Dead Space the game will be right up your street. It's didn't have quite the same impact but like The Surge and The Surge 2, it's a solid enough entry in the genre to while away the time. But with the games releases in 2023 ramping up in the runup to the holiday, you might want to download it to revisit when the calendar is looking less cramped.

Love Island farmer Will Young has been unlucky in love so far in the villa, but his situation could now be on the up and up after Jessie Wynter entered the villa

Love Island fans are calling for farmer Will Young to take home the ITV2 show win on his own after the single Islander comforted his co-star Anna-May Robey.

Will was first to give the Islander a hug as she was left in tears when Kai Fagan told her he didn't feel they would be going anywhere romantically, with fans noticing he appeared to be petting her like one of his animals on the farm.

The ITV2 reality dating show returned with another explosive episode this week as the winter series gets well underway in sunny South Africa.

The farmer has been unlucky in love so far in the villa, but his situation could now be on the up and up after Jessie Wynter entered the palatial pad this week.

Love Island fans have championed Will, with many calling for him to go all the way to the final of the show.

Will even told co-star Lana Jenkins that he ""˜thinks he loves' the new Love Island Australia bombshell, leaving fans agape.

Taking to Twitter, one wrote: ""Can we let Will win on his own?!"" as a second penned: ""Will is literally that guy best friend, look at the way he's comforting her.""

Another joked: ""Will petting Anna-may like she's an alpaca.""

""Will just being a good shoulder for Anna-May is so pure,"" one fellow viewer wrote.

Love Island shocked fans last week when it welcomed its latest newcomers from the Australian spin-off of the ITV2 reality dating show.

During a pool party in the South African villa, Aaron Waters and Jessie entered the palatial pad touting bottles of champagne.

The Love Island veterans both hope to find someone on the British show after they surprised their fellow contestants.

Jessie appeared in the 2019 series of Love Island Australia and made quite the impression during her stint on the show, as she coupled up with four different men and won fans over with her savage one-liners.

Alongside the personal trainer, who was originally from Tasmania but now lives in Sydney, was male model Aaron, who is also no stranger to the Love Island villa villa.

Aaron reached the final of the Australian version in 2021, when he finished runner-up with Jess Velkovsk, after an explosive journey which saw her accused of gaslighting at one point.

Love Island airs every night at 9pm on ITV2 and ITV Hub.

The PS Plus October 2023 games will be revealed later this week, with leaks claiming that The Callisto Protocol and Farming Simulator 22 are part of the lineup

The PS Plus Essential October 2023 games are set to be revealed later this week, with the games releasing the following Tuesday.

PS Plus Essential is the original and cheapest version of the PlayStation subscription, with three titles being added to your account each month, which you can keep as long as you're subscribed. Last month the PS Plus price increase was announced alongside the September 2023 free games which included Saints Row, Generation Zero, and Black Desert - Traveller Edition.

While the lineup is yet to be officially announced, just like clockwork, PS Plus October 2023 leaks arrived earlier today, with Twitter leaker @Billbil_kun claiming that The Callisto Protocol and Farming Simulator 22 will be joining the free games lineup alongside a third - yet unknown - title alongside it. Based on The Callisto Protocol being a AAA release that's less than a year old, we can't imagine a huge title will take the third spot, but stranger things have happened.

PS Plus Essential October 2023 reveal time

The PS Plus Essential titles for each month are typically revealed on the final Wednesday of the month prior over on the PlayStation Blog (unless the first day of the month lands on a Wednesday - it'll be revealed then in that case). Based on that knowledge, the PS Plus Essential October 2023 free games will be announced tomorrow, Wednesday, September 27 at 4.30pm BST / 11:30am EDT / 8:30am PDT.

PS Plus Essential games subsequently become available on the first Tuesday of every month, which means they'll be available to download on Tuesday, October 3 at 10am BST / 5am EDT / 2am PDT.

PS Plus Essential games are only available until the following month's lineup is drops, so you'll have until Tuesday, November 7 to redeem them. On that note, if you've yet to add the PS Plus Essential September 2023 games to your library, make sure you do so before Tuesday, October 3. You don't need to download them to your console either; just add them to your library and you can download them whenever you like, so long as your PS Plus subscription is active.

PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers who are keen to find out which games will be added this month will have to wait another couple of weeks, with the reveal coming after the release of the free PS Essential games. That means the Extra and Premium games will be announced on Wednesday, October 11, before releasing the following Tuesday, October 17..

Start-up cattle farmer Rebecca Shortt lost her case against multi-millionaire Joseph CorrÃ© after being taken to a small claims court over unpaid rent and damage to a farm which he owns in Cornwall

A young mum on Universal Credit says she will be put at ""great financial risk"" after being ordered to pay nearly £5,000 to the multi-millionaire son of fashion designer Vivienne Westwood.

Rebecca Shortt, a tenant cattle farmer, lost her case against Joseph CorrÃ© after being taken to a small claims court over unpaid rent and damage to a farm which he owns in north Cornwall. Both appeared in person and unrepresented at Bodmin County Court yesterday, where it was heard how she owed him £2,324 in unpaid rent and another £2,000 in unpaid farm repair costs.

Ms Shortt, 31, told how she had refused to pay last year's rent because of a water leak on the farm, which meant there was not enough water on the fields she used for her dairy cows. ""I didn't pay because the farm was untenable,"" she said. ""It's not a farm if there's no water. You can't keep animals there.""

After being ordered to pay £4,324, as well as £551 for Mr CorrÃ©'s court fees, she said: ""I don't have any money. I can't pay it as I'm on Universal Credit. I have absolutely zero prospect of paying it.""

Following the hearing, the start-up farmer told Cornwall Live: ""It's going to put me at a great financial risk. It will put a huge financial stress on me. I don't have anything to sell. He claims to be humanitarian and environmentalist and campaigned for Julian Assange's release. He's active in human rights campaigns yet he decided to take a young mum who's trying to farm for wildlife to court for less than £5,000.""

She added: ""I'm just glad my baby is safe and that I'll be able to carry on my work to improve cow welfare and advocate sustainable farming. Fortunately having a clear conscience still doesn't cost anything in Britain at the moment.""

Mr CorrÃ©, the co-founder of fashion brand Agent Provocateur, had claimed against Ms Shortt for several months of unpaid rent from April to September last year, and for the cost of repairs to gates and fences which he said were not carried out despite an agreement having been signed by both parties.

Ms Shortt, who is originally from Penge in South London, argued ""they were rotten in the first place"", and repairing them meant improving Mr CorrÃ©'s property rather than just repairing it. She first signed a farm tenancy agreement with Mr CorrÃ© in 2019 with the idea to farm the land sustainably, followed by a second tenancy agreement in 2021 when her private circumstances changed.

She said the discovery of the water leak in April 2020 - on one of the fields kept by Mr CorrÃ© for his personal use adjacent to hers - happened when she received a huge water bill that did not reflect her water usage. She said Mr CorrÃ© asked her to turn the water off until the water leak could be found and fixed.

Ms Shortt said: ""My expectation was that the leak would be fixed and the water would be turned back on by the landlord."" The activist and businessman, who acquired the land in Cornwall 15 years ago, refuted claims that the farmer's cows didn't have access to any water.

He said that apart from one or two fields, there were streams running along the others, there was a water source and access to a bore hole, insisting also that the young farmer had access to a water bowser. ""There was water everywhere,"" Mr CorrÃ© told the court.

""Since she has moved away I have had another tenant in and nothing has changed and there has been no issue with access to water. The situation was never desperate. She also never told me the farm was untenable."" Ms Shortt, who has since relocated to mid-Cornwall, said the farm only had two tiny streams and also denied being given access to a borehole, saying that her expectations as a tenanted farmed were that it was the landlord's responsibility to provide access to water.

She added: ""The fields kept being swapped because of some rewilding idea he had. I would not have agreed to pay this amount of rent if I had known there was a water issue. I left because of it and because of his aggressive bullying behaviour and constant harassment. He swore at me because of the noise milking my cows made was disturbing his peace. He was threatening over all sorts of things.""

Mr CorrÃ© denied making such threats, saying he had been exasperated at times when Ms Shortt's animals escaped, including cows running onto the A39 nearby and a flock of chickens pooing in front of a holiday let he owns.

He added: ""She couldn't control her animals. She was inexperienced in farming and was struggling. She tried different forms of farming but she couldn't make it work and to be accused of bullying behaviour and being aggressive is not true. I never threatened her with eviction. I told her it was not working out between us. But she behaved dishonestly.""

Despite claims and counter claims made by both parties, District Judge Inglis said it was not the purpose of a small claim court to pass judgment on any aspects of morality or fairness but to look at the legality of agreements signed by the two parties.

""It's not this court's place to judge on the fairness of it, just on its legality,"" he told Ms Shortt. ""Even if it appears one-sided."" District Judge Inglis ruled in favour of Mr CorrÃ©, noting the tenancy agreement stipulated clearly that access to water was not a requisite of the tenancy agreement and leaks would have to be paid by the tenant as well as repairs to boundaries and gates.

Mr CorrÃ© insisted taking her to court had never been about the money. He said: ""It's a point of principle that's all. I don't care about the money. I gave someone a chance to do something and they acted in a dishonourable way. It's about integrity. I'm not bothered about the money. But it's the principle.""

Our Yorkshire Farm star Amanda Owen and her son Reuben shared a sweet selfie, which comes after Amanda's rumoured lover is said to be divorcing his wife to settle down with her

Our Yorkshire Farm star Amanda Owen and son Reuben have shared a sweet mother and son selfie, with fans of the Channel 5 programme and the farming family all spotting one detail.

19-year-old Reuben is the oldest son of Yorkshire shepherdess Amanda Owen and her ex-husband Clive Owen, and TV viewers loved the family including Amanda, Clive and their nine children as part of Channel 5 show Our Yorkshire Farm.

Reuben shared the snap as part of a recent update including his own farming work, a huge JCB and family updates as he beamed alongside his mum for a selfie. In the pictures Reuben captioned his images: ""Few recent pictures"" alongside a tractor emoji. Sharing the carousel of snaps, Reuben's 74,000 followers all spotted the same thing about the selfie with Amanda.

Jumping into the comment section, one fan wrote: ""Nice to see ur mum smiling"". Another agreed as they added: ""Lovely to see your mum hope she's keeping well"". A third shared: ""Thanks for the pics Reuben, working hard as always but having fun too, appreciate the pic of you and your Mum, hope she is doing OK, please pass on love!""

The comments come after Amanda's lover and rumoured boyfriend Robert Davies is said to be divorcing his wife of 12 years Yusami, with plans to settle down with Amanda as a result. Amanda is said to be thriving in her new relationship and is thought to be 'inseparable' from her new man, but is yet to publicly confirm or deny the rumours about her love life.

Amanda and ex husband Clive, who had been married for 21 years and share nine children together, split last year announcing the news with a joint statement. The jointly claimed: ""Clive and I are sad to confirm that we have made the difficult decision to separate. This hasn't been easy, but we both believe it's the right choice for the future of our family. Although we are no longer a couple, we continue to work on the farm and co-parent together, with our number one priority being the happiness and well-being of our children.""

Outside of her love life, Amanda sparked concern recently as she announced the closure of the family farm Ravenseat. The farm is closed to visitors with a note on the website that reads: ""Ravenseat Farm is closed to visitors until further notice, so, unfortunately, we are not serving cream teas. Thank you for your understanding. Amanda."" This isn't the first time the farm has closed its doors before. Last year the farm was shut to members of the public after lambing season had overwhelmed the farm.

Barcelona opened the scoring through Robert Lewandowski at Old Trafford on Thursday night, with the Poland international beating David de Gea from the penalty spot

Barcelona appeared to mock Manchester United and the Premier League on Twitter just seconds after scoring at Old Trafford.

Robert Lewandowski broke the deadlock from the penalty spot in the second leg of their Europa League knockout play-off match on Tuesday, slotting past David de Gea after a staggered run that drew criticism from fans on social media.

Minutes after the ball hit the back of the net, following the Barcelona players' celebrating in front of their fans and the game resuming, the LaLiga club's official Twitter account took the opportunity to run salt in the wounds of the United supporters.

Alongside a picture of former Bayern Munich striker Lewandowski mocked up as a farmer while picking footballs from a tree, read the caption: ""Working in the field:""

Fans responded to the tweet by pointing out the joke, which suggests that the Premier League is a lesser competition to LaLIga and the other top-flight divisions in Europe.

Man United drew 2-2 with Barcelona in the first leg of their Europa League clash at the Camp Nou.

Former Chelsea defender Marcos Alonso opened the scoring for Barca before Marcus Rashford hit back to level the scores just two minutes later. United then led via a Jules Kounde own goal but there was a final sting in the tail for the Red Devils.

Levelling the scores 15 minutes before the end, former Leeds forward Raphinha found the back of the net to set up a tantalising second leg at Old Trafford.

After of Thursday's match, United boss Erik ten Hag said: ""With such big teams as Barcelona every day you have to show your best. Tomorrow we have to give the best performance of the season. We believe in it, we're looking forward to it, so we have to give a lot of energy.""

He added: ""We all want to play big games. When we were young we dreamt of it. We are in the position, it's February. Big games are coming up and we enjoy it, we're really excited and we have to give our best.""

The heatwave is gripping the United States, shattering records and posing health risks to humans, plants and animals - relief may come for some regions early next week

A widespread heat wave is currently affecting the United States, bringing with it soaring temperatures that have shattered long-standing records. From coast to coast, cities are experiencing extreme heat, posing a risk to health.

Climate scientists are closely monitoring the situation to understand the heat wave's implications on agriculture, infrastructure, and the environment. The event has sparked discussions about climate change and its potential impact on weather patterns.

Phoenix in particular has been hardest hit - it weathered its 27th consecutive day above 110 degrees (43 Celsius) on Wednesday. Dangerous heat engulfed much of the eastern half of the United States Friday as extreme temperatures spread from the Midwest into the Northeast and mid-Atlantic where some residents saw their hottest temperatures of the year.

7 more people have died amid record highs in Arizona

Another seven heat-associated deaths were confirmed over the last week in America's hottest big metro, health officials reported Wednesday, amid a blistering heat wave with daytime highs over 110 F (43.3 C) and overnight lows not dropping below 90 F (32.2 C).

Maricopa County, the most populous county in Arizona and home to Phoenix, reported that its health department has confirmed 25 heat-associated deaths this year as of Saturday since the first one was recorded in April, with 249 more under investigation.

That's seven more heat-associated deaths for the year since 18 were reported as of July 15, when there were 69 additional deaths under investigation.

Both this year and last, about 80% of the people who died fell ill when they were outdoors, and more than a third were people experiencing homelessness. Over half of all heat-associated deaths involved drug use.

Heatwave temperatures are so hot even cactuses are dying in the heat

It's not only humans at risk, but plants too. The scorching heat in Phoenix, combined with a lack of seasonal monsoons, has resulted in some cacti succumbing to the extreme weather conditions.

The situation has become so severe that some cactuses appear seemingly normal or slightly squishy, only to collapse later, revealing they have been rotting from the inside out, a consequence of the heat-related stress.

With the prolonged heatwave showing no signs of letting up, there are growing fears that the unique cactus population in the region could be at risk.

In addition to the environmental impact, the loss of cacti could disrupt the ecosystem and potentially affect other plant and animal species that rely on them for shelter and sustenance, experts fear.

Eight dogs die in uncooled cargo van driving through sweltering Midwest heat wave

At least eight dogs lost their lives due to heat-related injuries while being transported in the back of an uncooled cargo van through northern Indiana.

The incident occurred during a sweltering Midwest heat wave that has been plaguing the region for days. The van was carrying 18 shepherds, who were being transported from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago to a training facility in Michigan City, Indiana, ABC reported.

Unfortunately, the driver, whose name has not been disclosed by the authorities, was unaware of the air conditioning failure in the cargo area until he heard the distressed barking of the dogs. Acting quickly, he pulled off Interstate 94 at a convenience store and gas station in Lake Station, Indiana.

Florida ocean temperatures peak to almost 38 degrees amid heatwave

Ocean t emperatures off the coast of South Florida have risen to a potentially record-breaking high. Water temperatures rose to a new, unfathomable level, on Monday evening, July 24, with a buoy in Manatee Bay, about 40 miles south of Miami, recording a temperature of 101.1F (38C) at 6pm. It came after a morning low of 91F (32.7C), with temperatures at or above 100F (37.7C) from 5pm through the late evening.

""It was like there was no difference between humidity of the air and going into the water,"" said Chelsea Ward of Fort Myers, Florida.

In comparison to the ocean temperatures, the 'ideal' temperature for a hot tub is between 100 and 102F (37.7 - 38.8C). While the Manatee Bay reading could be an unprecedented global high, there are no official records maintained for ocean temperatures.

What have experts said about the affect of climate change?

There is some debate amongst experts about whether you can attribute a specific weather event to climate change. However, there is a general consensus that climate change makes adverse weather events, like heatwaves, more likely to occur.

Dr Chloe Brimicombe, Climate Scientist and Extreme Heat Researcher, University of Graz, said: ""The extreme heat occurring in the northern hemisphere is more likely to be the result of climate change, the last time we saw heat in different regions at the same time was last summer.

""There is some evidence to show that heat is affecting a larger proportion of the population year on year.This is in addition to heat occurring for longer durations, more frequently and more intense.

""Heat does not just cause excess death amongst the elderly. I'm most worried about the impact of heat on pregnant women, young babies and children. We see a rise in preterm birth as an outcome of pregnancy with exposure to extreme heat. And a rise in hospital admissions amongst all of these groups.

""This heat is a symptom of climate change. We need urgent action on climate mitigation to net zero and beyond - this is 1.2C above baseline temperature warming, 3C is unimaginable.""

When will the heatwave end?

There could be some relief from the heatwave early next week (July 31). It depends in large part on where you live. A dip in the jet stream is expected to bring relief and cap off the ""brief but impactful"" heat wave in the Midwest and East, bringing thunderstorms - and some relief from the heat, AccuWeather chief meteorologist Jonathan Porter told USA TODAY.

According to the National Weather Service, a cold front is forecasted to usher in more comfortable temperatures across the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, and Midwest on Sunday and into early next week.

However, a significant portion of the country is bracing for peak heat wave conditions. The scorching temperatures that have dominated the Southwest have now extended their reach to the Midwest and Northeastern United States.

In Houston, a new heat wave is expected to start Sunday (July 30) and continue through early August, AccuWeather predicts.

An autopsy report in the death of 38-year-old Hugh - a manatee living in a Florida aquarium tank - died of a 'rip in his colon' from extreme sexual activity with his brother

An autopsy report has been released determining the cause of death for Hugh - a 38-year-old Florida manatee who died in April after exhibiting ""heightened sexual activity"" with his brother, who is a much larger male.

The necropsy report says Hugh died from a rip in his colon caused by a sexual encounter with his male brother, Buffett, ABC7 WWSB-TV reported.

The Mote Marine Aquarium and Laboratory released a statement saying, ""Hugh and Buffett engaged in natural, yet increased, mating behaviour observed and documented in manatees both in managed care and in the wild. This was the first time such heightened mating behaviour was witnessed between the two manatees.""

They further stated that the two are only usually sexually active for two months out of the year. But the marine creature's paperwork alleges that, ""the United States Department of Agriculture said Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium failed to act to protect Hugh which led to his death,"" ABC7 reported.

ABC7 reported the USDA said ""facility representatives, employees observed high-intensity sexual behaviour between two adult male manatees, which resulted in penetration of the smaller male, at approximately 10am.""

It was shortly after this that employees collected a sample from the smaller male and ""confirmed the presence of fresh blood.""

""The sexual behaviour continued throughout the day with periods of rest between high-intensity interactions and occasional penetration. At approximately 5:15pm, the larger male was observed penetrating, the smaller male again. When the larger male swam away, the smaller male was seen unresponsive at the bottom of the pool. It was confirmed that he had passed,"" concludes the report.

In their defence, Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium posted a Facebook note detailing Hugh's last day: ""The manatees were under heightened observation throughout the day, and the animal care team was in constant close communications with, and following the direction of, the attending veterinarians throughout the day.""

""Hugh and Buffett were both observed initiating and mutually seeking interactions from each other throughout the day and there were no obvious signs of discomfort or distress such as listing, crunching, or active avoidance that would have triggered a need for intervention.""

""Following the direction of the veterinarians, distraction rather than physical separation was chosen because separation has previously caused undue anxiety and negative effects in both manatees. In an effort to redirect the manatees' attention and decrease undesirable behaviours, animal care staff used positive reinforcement tools such as high-value rewards and enrichment that had previously been successful,"" said aquarium officials.

A 6-year-old boy suffered 'traumatic injuries' after falling off the Galaxy Spin ride at the Fun Spot America - Kissimmee amusement park in Florida. Rescue crews managed to recover the boy from about 20 feet beneath the ride's track

A six-year-old child was rushed to a hospital with serious injuries after falling off a rollercoaster at an amusement park, in a horrifying incident.

Rescue crews rushed to the Fun Spot America - Kissimmee amusement park in Florida at around 3pm local time on Thursday afternoon responding to reports that a child had fallen from a roller coaster called The Galaxy Spin.

The circumstances under which the dramatic fall occurred are unclear, however, rescuers from the Osceola County Fire Rescue Department managed to lift the boy from about 20 feet beneath the ride's track. He was rushed to Orlando Health Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, Florida, where he was treated for serious injuries.

A spokesperson from the Osceola County Fire Rescue Department told FOX 35 that the child had suffered ""traumatic injuries."" The exact condition and injuries of the child are unknown. The park ride was reportedly closed to the public after the incident.

Another statement by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services read: ""The department is aware of the incident and we're currently investigating. The ride is closed pending the outcome of the investigation."" That agency is responsible for inspecting most attractions and rides in Florida.

Fun Spot America said in a statement late Friday: ""An unfortunate incident happened on the Galaxy Spin Roller Coaster that resulted in a child being injured."" They added: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the child and their family, and we pray for a speedy recovery.""

Fun Spot's statement did not specify how the incident occurred. However, they said that the rollercoaster was found to be in a ""normal operating condition"" and that all safety procedures and guidelines were followed, despite the unfortunate incident.

The statement added: ""The safety of our guests is our number one priority. We are working with the Florida Department of Agriculture and the manufacturer to investigate the incident.

""The FDACS has inspected the ride and found it to be in normal operating condition with no mechanical issues. They also found the ride was operated following all safety procedures and guidelines outlined by the manufacture and industry standards.""

The Galaxy Spin is a wild mouse-style coaster with car seats, each of which seats up to four people. The ride takes visitors around sharp corners and tight turns with a couple of drops along the way.

Fun Spot said the ride is closed pending the investigation and would not reopen ""until we are 100% sure this will not happen again."" There are two Fun Spot amusement parks in Florida - Orlando and Kissimmee - and a third in Atlanta, Georgia.

Oscar Pistorius shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp dead at his home in Pretoria, South Africa, 10 years ago. The Mirror has been given exclusive details of Pistorius's life in Atteridgeville prison

Valentine's Day killer Oscar Pistorius is driving a tractor on his prison's farm to help feed needy schoolkids as he hopes to win over a parole board.

The disgraced Paralympic sprinter, known as the Blade Runner, shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp dead at his home in Pretoria, South Africa, 10 years ago tomorrow and will soon make a bid to be released.

And as Reeva's parents prepared to mark the anniversary of the 29-year-old's death with a ceremony at the beach where they scattered her ashes, the Mirror was given exclusive details of Pistorius's life in Atteridgeville prison - a low-security site that has been described as ""comfy"".

One jail source said: ""Pistorius remains muscular and fit.

""He has been seen driving a red tractor in fields around the prison, being trained to plough a straight furrow.

""The produce of the agriculture, including cauliflower, is then sold to help feed poverty-stricken schoolchildren.""

One official who saw Pistorius, 36, recently said he was a model inmate but added: ""You can never tell if a prisoner is just putting on an act until he is released.

""Much depends on how much he's been concealing his true feelings and whether he has worked through them.""

If released next month, Pistorius - who had both legs amputated under the knee as a baby - will have served eight years of a 15-year sentence for model Reeva's murder.

The official said the system favours the offender, explaining: ""The parole board doesn't have much communication with victims' families, while staff focus on building a relationship with the prisoner.""

If his bid fails, Pistorius - previously held at the Kgosi Mampuru II jail - will move to another site as Atteridgeville, near Pretoria, is becoming a women-only prison.

Meanwhile, Reeva's parents, Barry and June, will join other family and close friends today to remember her.

They plan to mix some of her ashes with those of a close family friend who died late last year, then cast them into the sea and sing her favourite songs.

A difficult maths question that featured in a higher-level test paper for Year 12 students in Australia has left many people stumped - as some labelled the question brutal

Frustrated students have taken to social media to reveal a tricky maths equation that left them stumped - with some labelling the exam question 'brutal.'

The impossible question was featured in a higher-level test paper for Year 12 students in Australia. Experts agree the maths problem is difficult to tackle, and had been designed to test the brain of Australia's most advanced mathematics students.

Miriam Lees, a consultant for the Mathematical Association of NSW, stated she had 'not seen a question like this in an extension 2 paper.' The exam question involved complex numbers, an extension of the real number system that involves combining real and imaginary numbers, reports The Sydney Morning Herald.

Australian maths teacher Ringo Mok from Sydney Science College has shared a video breaking down how to solve it. ""We have this question where we have complex numbers W and Z that lie on the unit circle,"" Mr Mok explained. ""And they are separated by an obtuse angle."" The full video can be watched here.

While Vivian Xu, a student at the James Ruse Agricultural High School explained how she answered the tricky question in a video shared on the Sydney Morning Herald TikTok page. The student goes into full detail on how she solved the problem. The equation has people scratching their heads with some saying they would have difficulty solving it with a calculator.

On the social media platform, one person joked: ""This reminds me of the time I had an argument with my ex."" Another person teased: ""I wouldn't even know how to put it in my calculator."" A third person chimed in: ""I don't even understand the question!""

One student who took the exam shared a video describing the equation and branded it ""diabolic"" and ""sadistic"" writing: ""The whole thing was so messed up."" A user agreed: ""All the math tests have been brutal this year."" As one weighed in: ""I literally had no clue.""

WARNING DISTRESSING IMAGES: The controversial Yulin festival has been held every year since 2009, with footage obtained by an animal rights charity shedding new light on its horrors

This year's Yulin Dog Meat Festival is underway as distressing footage has emerged of chefs preparing for the controversial festival where thousands of pooches will be consumed.

Campaigners from the NoToDogMeat charity have recently arrived in Yulin, South East China, preparing to document the slaughter and rescue as many dogs as possible.

In footage obtained by the charity and shared with the Mirror, shops are seen laying out dog corpses on the counters shops ahead of the June 21 Summer Solstice event.

The dogs, which have been rounded up from nearby villages and transported to the festival, will be consumed for a period of 10 days.

Festival organisers claim that the dogs are killed humanely and that it is ""no different from eating pork or beef"".

Meanwhile, animal rights campaigners claim the dogs are killed inhumanely using horrific methods including hanging and blowtorching.

Qin Xi Zhao, who runs the charity's largest shelter in Hebei: ""This is the most devastating part of my life, and every year we see things which are so traumatic. But as a charity we will not look away, and will do all we can to help the dogs.""

The Yulin festival began in 2009, and every year since - including during the pandemic - people have gathered to watch dogs being slaughtered and turned into stews and soups.

The price of dog meat varies, with small stalls charging less than bigger ones. But on average the cost to eat a butchered dog is £5 per pound, and around £10 for a kilogram.

Last month NoToDogMeat appealed to western tourists not to travel to the event, over fears that the spectacle could be bigger than ever due to the relaxing of Covid travel rules.


Julia de Cadenet, a London-based lawyer who founded the charity in 2009, told The Mirror: ""This year is set to be bigger and nastier than in recent years, and we are bracing ourselves.

""As ever, we will be carrying out rescues, and campaigners are there now, but we need support and donations to help us rescue as many dogs as possible.

""At the moment we are creating a fighting fund to help with our efforts, and the money will go directly towards supporting NoToDogMeat on the ground saving dogs from a terrible fate.""

In a prepared statement ahead of the festival, she said: ""Two days ago, our team arrived in Yulin. We could not stand by and wait for the festival to begin.

""This year all of our volunteers are Chinese and hate what happens to dogs and cats. They are led by brave Mr Zhao, who has rescued dogs many times from this horror fest. We are sad to confirm that the dog meat markets are open, and the killing has started.""

Two years ago the charity uncovered an illegal dog farm, and campaigners plan to go back there. The charity also plans to raid some slaughterhouses and try to stop the dealers, who are operating illegally.



Julia added: ""From what we have seen so far, most of the people eating dogs are local. So far, no foreigners are in sight. As the weeks continue, people will arrive from out of state.

""We must remind the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture that dogs are on the 'safe list'. They are not for consumption.""


NoToDogMeat is urging people around the world to write to Minister of Agriculture chief Tan Renjian to make their feelings known.

The Asia For Animals coalition says that it is hard to gauge how many animals are slaughtered each year at Yulin. However, where figures have been collected the festival is believed to be responsible for the slaughter of between 10,000 and 15,000 dogs.

Many of the animals are stolen pets, but despite this, the meat is not cheap, and promoted by traders as a health tonic.

The Asia For Animals coalition adds: ""Dog and cat meat is NOT part of China's mainstream food culture. Dog meat was not on the government's food rationing list in the past, nor is it on the list of meat guaranteed by China's strategic meat reserve'.""

The chef shared his top tips for making perfectly smooth and creamy mashed potatoes that will have your family asking for seconds and your guests asking for the recipe

A celebrity chef has said that we've all been making the classic mashed potatoes wrong all this time.

Christmas may be over but if you live in a Sunday roast dinners house then you need to make sure your mashed potatoes are creamy and smooth and if you've ever struggled with that then one celebrity chef has a few tips that can help you. The chef shared his top tips for making perfectly smooth and creamy mashed potatoes that will have your family asking for seconds and your guests asking for the recipe.

Whilst this year's celebrations may be over, top celebrity chef Andrew Rudd has said when it comes to preparing Christmas dinner mashed potatoes should be prepared well in advance of the day. Andrew, who is the CEO and founder of Medley, grew up on a farm in County Offaly, Ireland.

Andrew's roots have influenced his cooking and he said: ""As a child, growing up on a pig farm in Co. Offaly, I learned important values from my parents that have stayed with me throughout my adult life. They taught me the difference between right and wrong, and instilled in me a love of food and sustainable agricultural production.""

Speaking to RSVP Live and moved to clarify a few things, Andrew said that one of his top tips for a smooth and creamy mash was to use a hand blender, something her learned from his parents.

He said: ""You can prepare your mashed potatoes the day before Christmas as well. Cook your potatoes as normal, if you have a ricer make sure you use it. If not, a regular masher will work.

""A hand blender or a paddle are also great tools, my mum and dad used these for years. Get a small saucepan and add in cream, milk, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Put the potato on the hob and gradually add that mix with a spatula.""

The key to knowing your mashed potatoes are ready comes down to getting the texture just right. And preparing them in advance means you can save time and focus more on them as well.

He said: ""It should turn out beautiful and smooth. When you feel like you have got the right texture then you are ready to serve it. It is a great idea to cook the mash the day before because it is one less thing to do on the day.""

Possibly the 'hardest' final year exam maths question ever has left many students stumped as they had to pull out all the stops to finish the exam paper on time - but can you answer it?

You'd like to think that you could answer exam questions for school-age kids - but what about one that's been dubbed as the ""hardest"" ever? Students taking the most challenging Higher School Certificate (HSC) maths exam in Australia's New South Wales are meant to be stretched out of their comfort zone by the paper, but some students were left baffled beyond belief by the question they saw.

Speaking to The Sydney Morning Herald, 17-year-old Vivian Xu from James Ruse Agricultural High School said: ""Questions 14 to 16 were harder than normal. I was super tight on time, and think I finished with two minutes left on the clock.""

To solve the question you need geometry, advanced trigonometry and visual representations skills, making the exam question super tough. Miriam Lees, a consultant for the Mathematical Association of NSW, said questions 15 and 16 of the extension 2 paper are set to specifically challenge the best students.

Complex numbers ""form the basis of a lot of our modern life"", she said, including computing currents and voltages. But she admitted that she'd never seen an exam question quite as tricky as this one before.

The advanced maths paper came in for some criticism online, with one TikTok user saying it was ""ridiculously hard."" The pupil fumed: ""NESA (NSW Education Standards Authority) what were you on when you wrote that?""

Another man took to Twitter to write: ""Seriously ""¦ 51 years ago I got in the top decile for Maths Extension 2 ""¦ but I assure you the questions were nowhere near this level"", reports the Daily Mail. Another student called for ""jail"" for whoever made the tough exam.

Someone online thought they'd figured it out, however, commenting: ""As someone who enjoys mathematical puzzles, I thought this was an interesting question and combines a fairly wide range of maths skills. To solve it you need to use de Moivre's theorem with complex numbers, algebra, limits, and graphical representation. I got that x<0, y<0, and y>x."" ""It's too hard for me"", another added. ""The answer is not numbers. You have to sketch it"", someone else suggested.

Millionaire Colin Armstrong had been forcibly kidnapped from his home in Ecuador last Saturday when he was bundled into a black BMW, but he has now been found alive and well

British millionaire Colin Armstrong, who was kidnapped from his home in Ecuador last weekend, has been rescued by police.

Mr Armstrong, former honorary consul of the United Kingdom in Guayaquil, was kidnapped in an operation involving more than 15 gangsters from his home Rancho Rodeo Grande and forcibly bundled into a black BMW he owned with his partner, which was later found abandoned near the scene. The shocking crime sparked a police investigation involving British intelligence services who were assisting in the search. Earlier today Ecuador's police chief, Cesar Augusto Zapata confirmed on X, previously known as Twitter, he had been found, alive and well.

In the update he added nine people had been arrested, although he did not go into detail. He wrote online: ""On the road to ManabÃ­, our units released citizen Collin A., kidnapped days before in LosRÃ­os . At the moment he is safe and healthy. There are 9 arrested. News in development.""

Alongside the update was a picture of the Brit flanked by two officers. His face appeared blurred in the image for an unknown reason and he was dressed in an overlarge jumper and a baseball cap. One person responded to the update: ""We are waiting for you with open arms, dear Colin.""

Footage showing the aftermath of the kidnap was posted online shortly after it happened. A woman thought to be a member of staff filming inside the ranch took close-up shots of broken plates on the floor and a man who appeared to be holding a bandage to his head.

Mr Armstrong, who is thought to have previously been married to an Ecuadorian woman, has had a long association with the South America country. He founded Agripac in 1972. As well as founding and owning a large agricultural supply company in the South American country, expat Mr Armstrong is a director along with his son of the 500-acre Tupgill Park Estate near Leyburn in North Yorkshire which has been the family home for more than 45 years.

Colin's adopted son, Leo Morris, helps run a restaurant at the family's Yorkshire estate. The estate now welcomes more than 150,000 visitors a year to an attraction known as the Forgotten Corner which was originally built as a private folly. Footage showing the aftermath of the kidnap was posted online shortly after it happened.

A woman thought to be a member of staff took close-up shots of broken plates on the floor and a man who appeared to be holding a bandage to his head. She then walked into one of the bedrooms where there was blood over the bed and said as she focused in on the stained sheets: ""This is where they hit him. My God, what is this!"" The woman appeared to be referring to the man she had filmed sitting on the stairs nursing what looked to be a head wound. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office confirmed: ""We are in contact with -Ecuadorian authorities following the disappearance of a British man and are supporting his family.""

The eerie footage was filmed in China and people were left utterly baffled by what they saw, when the huge black object slithered through the water in front of them

Eerie footage emerged of a 'water monster' swimming past a huge hydroelectric dam.

Residents near the huge Three Gorges Dam in east China were left baffled when they saw the black object slithering through the water surface. They said the suspected monster is about 20 metre (60 feet) long and 'moves like a snake' just feet away from the river banks.

Others said the saw the same creature near the Yangtze River in Yichang in central China's Hubei province on Sunday. Professor Wang Chunfang, from Huazhong Agricultural University, told Pear Video that it could be a water snake. She said: ""It's definitely not a water monster. Could be some marine animals that have been living under the water for years.

""I can't tell what it is exactly as only a little of it surfaced. But it moves like a snake. It should be some sort of reptile - and more likely to be a water snake."" Workers at the nearby Jiangkou Pier told Pear Video that it was not a water monster but a pile of rubber band and canvas. They said: ""It's an abandoned rubber band dumped into the water. The rubber band is used to build inflatable boats. It's wrapped together with canvas. cI believe it must have drifted all the way from Yangtze River.""

In one prison in Norway, prisoners are provided their very own cottage, as well as farmland to grow their own crops, and if that wasn't enough they can also go horseback riding or take tennis lessons while serving time for crimes as serious as murder and rape

There are a handful of correctional facilities across the globe where murderers and rapists live in prisons likened to boutique hotels and holiday resorts.

In some prisons comfort, prisoner wellbeing and rehabilitation are more important than punishment, even if the crimes committed by their residents are grave. By bucking the trend of the inhumane conditions seen across the world, some of the countries have been rewarded with plummetting reoffending rates.

Inmates at many of these jails have the opportunity to stay in contact with their families on the outside, while one has even allowed relatives to live inside the prison walls in the hopes of keeping familial bonds strong and preventing the trauma of separation.

Other facilities have a myriad of activities on offer to rival any adventure holiday, including horseback riding, tennis lessons, and prison-wide dancing performances. The most lax nick of the lot gives prisoners their own cottage along with a patch of farm land to cultivate.

Here's a list of the world's ten most luxurious prisons...

10. Cebu Prison, Philippines

The Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center, a 1,600-inmate nick in the Philippines' Cebu Province, in a maximum security jail meant for the most hardened Filippino killers and rapists. Though it is meant to house just over 1,500 convicts, in 2020 it was critically congested, raising fears of the rapid spread of coronavirus.

Cebu is one of the rogue mentions in the list, as the conditions aren't particularly pleasant. The reason for its inclusion is the prison's novel approach to rehabilitation, which has offered inmates a number of recreational and creative exercises to keep them occupied. Each inmate is required to participate in singing and dancing numbers and they have put on a series of performances for the paying public.

In February 2023, the so-called Dancing Inmates were said to be preparing for a return to public viewings after a two year break due to Covid-19. Some of their dances have become so popular in the Philippines that they are mobbed for autographs when they finish.

9. Halden Prison, Norway

The crimes committed by the residents of Halden Prison stand in stark contrast to its reputation as one of the world's most humane jails. Rapists, murderers and paedophiles line the wings of the nick, which became the flagship of Norway's justice system after it was opened in 2010.

The £138million minimalist complex sits in a sprawling forest, which has often been compared to a boujee hotel rather than a maximum security prison. Each cell has a flatscreen, an en-suite toilet with a door for privacy, and a shower. The prisoners are also provided with large fluffy towels, their own fridges and unbarred windows for an un restricted view of the stunning forest outside.

Outside of the private, comfortable quarters, each wing enjoys a communal recreation room where prisoners can watch TV, movies, and play video games. There is also a studio for recording music, a state-of-the-art gym and convicts have the choice to undertake classes to build their skills.

8. Sollentuna Prison, Sweden

Similarly to Halden, convicts at Sollentuna are given their own private cells with comfortable beds and joining bathrooms. They also have a fully-equipped gym where they can keep fit, an open kitchen to cook meals, and a simple room where they can kick back and watch TV.

Another high-security prison in the list, it earns its place for its trailblazing eco initiatives. It won the 2019 BREEAM Public Projects In-Use award for installing a massive 1,100 square metre green roof of plants and turf. The greenery ""protects the roof from [solar] radiation, rainfall and temperature changes,"" and helps ""facilitate the run-off of surface water onto the property, while also enabling pollination ""¦ for insects,"" said Sara Jägermo, Vasce's head of property.

They also installed an air-recylcing ventilation system and a room where they can collect multiple different categories of waste. Insulating glass surrounding the entire structure also helps the building regulate its temperature.

7. JVA Fuhlsbuettel Prison, Germany

Hamburg's JVA Fuhlsbuettel prison, which is based in a former Nazi concentration camp, is far cushier than its history would suggest. Swanky cells, washing machines and spotless floors are all available to the long-term prisoners serving their sentences.

The facility has drawn criticism in the past for its approach to punishment, but the prisoners are grateful for the additional telephone nooks that they can use when speaking to family members.

6. Champ-Dollon Prison, Switzerland

The maximum security Champ-Dollon prison was built in 1977 to house just 200 inmates, and being a remand facility with 60 per cent of prisoners awaiting trial, it became critically overcrowded.

Before a major £32million cash injection in 2011 the cells were packed full, with diseases spreading with ease through the prison population. Riots were also regular.

With the money, authorities spruced up the nick, with prisoners now given triple occupancy cells with attached bathrooms. There has also been a major revamp to the outdoor areas, with plenty of activities for them to participate in. Some say it makes prisoners feel as though they're living on a university dorm rather than doing time.

5. Aranjuez Prison, Spain

Aranjuez Prison in Madrid is the first of its kind, a prison designed to keep families together. The nick is said to be the only one in the world with cells specifically for families, where toddlers can go to nursery and play, while locked up with their murdering and drug-trafficking parents.

The spacious units dubbed ""five-star cells"" come with cribs and Disney characters on the walls. Outside there's even a prison playground for the kids.

The idea is for children to bond with their imprisoned parents while young enough not to fully grasp the reality of incarceration, and for inmates seeking rehabilitation to learn parenting skills.

4. Justice Center Leoben, Austria

Nestled in a mountainous part of Austria, the Justice Center Leoben has repeatedly ranked among the world's best prisons and is often compared to a five-star hotel. It differs from the rest of the facilities because it is designed for 205 non-violent offenders.

Each prisoner gets their own ""cell"", along with an adjoining bathroom, kitchenette, TV, and full-size window for a view of the spectacular scenery. In the recreational area outside, cons can play basketball, work out at the outdoor gym or chill at the spa. Others can simply wander around and socialise freely.

3. Otago Corrections Facility, New Zealand

The Otago Corrections Facility in Milton, New Zealand, was opened in 2007 for low to medium-security male prisoners.

The facility is surrounded by a high-security fence, but inside there is plenty of space for prisoners to exercise and mingle. A separate building is used for accommodation, with rooms said to be comfortable.

But where Otago really stands out is its approach to rehabilitation and providing convicts with skills they can use on their release.

Among the education on offer are qualifications in carpentry, hospitality and even engineering.

2. HMP Addiewell, Scotland

HMP Addiewell is similarly focussed on building productive skills for its 700 prisoners and aims to have every single convict turn out of the facility with something to help them succeed on the outside.

According to the Scottish Prisons Service, Addiewell is designed to be a ""learning prison"" where convicts are urged to address their offending behaviour and the ""circumstances which led to their imprisonment"".

The learning element of their stay aims to ""improve their employability prospects"". Each week, prisoners are required to complete 40 hours of what it calls ""purposeful activity"".

1. Bastoy Prison, Norway

Plonked on a deserted island in 1982, the Bastoy Prison sits in one square mile of pine trees, with stunning views of the ocean. It houses a maximum of 100 murderers and rapists, who have access to such thrilling activities as horseback riding, fishing, tennis lessons and sunbathing.

Rather than cells, the convicts get cottages to live in with their own farmland to toil. Rather than the pot noodles found in British nicks, the chef at Bastoy offers up the likes of ""fish balls with white sauce, with shrimps"" as well as ""everything from chicken con carne to salmon"".

Despite its minimum security and the horrendous nature of its prisoners crimes', Bastoy is said to have the lowest reoffending rate in Europe, reported The Guardian.

When interviewed by CNN in 2012, prison governor Arne Kvernvik Nilsen said: ""If we have created a holiday camp for criminals here, so what?""

He added: ""We should reduce the risk of reoffending, because if we don't, what's the point of punishment, except for leaning toward the primitive side of humanity?""

And the numbers speak for themselves. Only 20 per cent of Norwegian convicts reoffended within two years of their release date in 2010, with figures in Bastoy even lower at around 16 per cent.","https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30922319.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Cebu-Dancing-Inmates.jpg","The Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center, a 1,600-inmate nick in the Philippines' Cebu Province, in a maximum security jail meant for the most hardened Filippino killers and rapists. Though it is meant to house just over 1,500 convicts, in 2020 it was critically congested, raising fears of the rapid spread of coronavirus. Cebu is one of the rogue mentions in the list, as the conditions aren't particularly pleasant. The reason for its inclusion is the prison's novel approach to rehabilitation, which has offered inmates a number of recreational and creative exercises to keep them occupied. Each inmate is required to participate in singing and dancing numbers and they have put on a series of performances for the paying public. In February 2023, the so-called Dancing Inmates were said to be preparing for a return to public viewings after a two year break due to Covid-19. Some of their dances have become so popular in the Philippines that they are mobbed for autographs when they finish. (Image:Getty Images)",10,TRUE,TRUE
244,"Heather O'Reilly on USWNT's World Cup chances, SoccerAid return and coaching aspirations","https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/heather-oreilly-socceraid-uswnt-wenger-30003524","Heather O'Reilly on USWNT's World Cup chances, SoccerAid return and coaching aspirations

The former USWNT midfielder has won a World Cup and three Olympic gold medals and will be returning to SoccerAid this year for the second time on the World XI team

It's not a monopoly, not yet at least.

The United States have laid claim to successive Women's World Cups, prying the 2015 trophy from Japan before doing away with Sarina Wiegman's Netherlands in 2019.

The ultimate acid test, however, lies less than 70 days away. Should Alex Morgan and co. lay claim once more to the trophy that has become synonymous with them in the last decade, they'll become the first team - men's or women's - to bring home three successive World Cup titles.

It's the sort of ridiculous international football dominance that, for now, exists solely in the hypothetical, and arguably threatens to do so. The USWNT's road to New Zealand and Australia has been ominous. Manager Vlatko Andonovski's team suffered three successive losses for the first time since 1993, with World Cup rivals England, Germany and France getting the better of them.

The word ""˜transition' crops up when pundits contemplate preparations. Doubts eagerly swarm over whether the world champions can live up to the hype in a year that competition, particularly from Europe, has never been headier.

""It's getting tight at the top,"" surmises Heather O'Reilly, the former USWNT midfielder with three Olympic gold medals and a 2015 World Cup winners medal.

""The USA has to roll up its sleeves to continue to find those one, two, three, five percent differences between them and other opponents. Resources are levelling out now, coaching, sport science, video analysis. All those things that we had a leg up due to a lot of things like Title XI, winning early in ""˜91 and winning breeds winning. These things snowballed for the US national team that would eventually get caught up to. Which is a great thing.

""But I do think we're evolving as well, and I think they have a really good chance. No one on the men's side or the women's side has ever won three World Cups in a row, it's never been done. A consecutive hat-trick of World Cups? What an incredible challenge.""

If there's one thing O'Reilly craves, it's a challenge. And while her national side prepare for theirs, the 38-year-old is gearing up for her own: the double at this year's SoccerAid and a potential sixth on the bounce for World XI.

Last year, she and Cafu ""had it going on the right side"", so much so that last year's World XI coach Arsene Wenger felt compelled to coax the 37-year-old out of her two-year retirement and fulfil her dream of playing Champions League football, the one omission from her footballing CV.

That O'Reilly scored on her European debut - a winner against ZNK Pomurje in Slovenia - came as a shock to approximately no one. The surprise move to Ireland's Shelbourne FC and subsequent success (she led Shelbourne to a successive women's top-flight title) fit seamlessly into the Heather O'Reilly playbook: work hard, win big.

Wenger won't coach O'Reilly's second SoccerAid stint (that honour belongs to Robbie Keane and Martin Compston), and while he has yet to offer his words of his wisdom ahead, the American isn't fretting. The former Arsenal manager reached out before her Champions League exploits. They have a bond famously forged in the Arsenal Training Centre salad bar line. ""I can always harass his assistant to get him to come out,"" O'Reilly quips, and one gathers the sense that the Frenchman wouldn't mind.

Arguably more important, O'Reilly doesn't explicitly rule out the possibility of another fantastic retirement U-turn off the back of this year's SoccerAid performance. ""Last year inspired a Champions League comeback; who knows what this performance will inspire?""

Despite offering up the tease with a conspiratorial glint, O'Reilly concedes the odds are phenomenal, even by her standards.

""I'm at that point in my life that I've done it career-wise,"" O'Reilly admits, a statement so succinct and normal it risks undermining the teeming catalogue of laurels spanning her Wikipedia page.

""A lot of opportunities come up now that are just icing on the cake. And I feel a responsibility not just to represent myself but to represent women and to be a source of inspiration.

""And maybe [me being in SoccerAid] draws more people to be interested in the women's game and if so, that's great. I love this game, and I think I can still play and knock it.

""Whether I can do that six days a week at the highest level, that's a question mark but I feel very fortunate to play in this event, that I still have my heart in this incredible sport and that my body still mostly cooperates.

""But at the end of the day, it's about the kids and raising money for them. If I'm able to do that with my platform, that's what it's all about.""

It's also, of course, about winning. O'Reilly is an uber-competitor's worst nightmare. Preparation for this year's competition includes training with the NWSL side North Carolina Courage's under-23s as a player-coach, meaning O'Reilly's sharpness will be two-fold at Old Trafford come June.

The preparations are in stark contrast to that which O'Reilly employed during her national and club career, going some way in explaining why O'Reilly believes the upcoming Women's World Cup will rank as the best there's ever been.

""I would be lucky if I drank a bottle of water a day,"" she says with cheerful incredulity. ""I look back now and I think how did I do that? I wasn't eating well, wasn't hydrated, not doing all of these things. The ability to better your game by these small percentages has certainly brought the level of the game forward.""

It also means the USWNT's challenge of attaining unprecedented World Cup glory will coincide with their toughest test yet. The US has traditionally set the tenor and tone on the women's stage, but O'Reilly notes that England, Germany, France and Spain all tout the sort of calibre, savvy and federation backing capable of knocking the US off their rock if the cards are played right.

Not that this has offset any of the usual confidence oozing from the USWNT camp. Star striker Alex Morgan has already claimed this year's team is ""the best"" there's been. The sentiment echoed that of defender Ali Krieger, who ignited a media storm in 2019 when she made the very claim ahead of the round of 16 clash with Spain.

A dangerous dance of arrogance or the necessary ethos of serial winners?

""The US generally doesn't play the underdog card well,"" O'Reilly admits with a smile. ""That's not our thing, that's not our identity. With the USWNT, we've rarely been the underdog. We've been bred and trained to say to ourselves, yes this pressure is real, it's a privilege. We are ranked No.1, we have these incredible standards of win or bust and saying those words are very scary because well, it's a good opportunity to fail.

""I think it's what separates the US from other teams throughout the past. Not a lot of athletes like that feeling, but we learned to have those incredibly high standards for yourself, you have to put yourself out there. You have to be exposed and strive for big things.""

It's not difficult to see that ethos applied in O'Reilly's own life. Her boots are technically hung up for now, but her ambitions are still doused in mettle. She admits she's attempting to take a page out of Wenger's book and keep those ambitions distilled.

""I find a lot of inspiration from Arsene because he stays focussed on his ambitions and his goals in the way that he stays true to some things. And I'm someone who thinks oh maybe this would be good, I'm all scatterbrained.""

But there's an essence to O'Reilly in which succumbing to her impulses is her greatest strength. Her Champions League romp is surely testament, or her 35-yard humdinger against Columbia in the 2011 World Cup group stages.

For now, O'Reilly is focused on SoccerAid, smashing the fundraising record set last year, and completing her coaching badges. She's currently coaching a male under-15s squad while working with the Courage.

She harbours ambitions to coach at the academy level, the dream being US Soccer's youth teams and a potential crack at Europe once her family gets older.

O'Reilly doesn't place a definitive end on her coaching ambitions there. Senior football exists, and she knows better than to place a ceiling on her impulses, particularly when those impulses reside in football.

The 'biblical' event on beaches across the Romagna Riviera, on the southern coast of Italy, caused tonnes of tourists to cut their stay short after the pesky insects swarmed the beaches and hotels

Dozens of holidaymakers have been forced to pack up and leave their beach resorts after a defeating invasion of grasshoppers on an Italian coastline.

The 'biblical' event on beaches across the Romagna Riviera, on the southern coast of Italy, caused tonnes of tourists to cut their stay short after the pesky insects swarmed the area between Bellaria Igea marina, San Mauro Mare and Cesenatico. Several tourists said the insect invasion was getting worse day by day, leaving people unable to sleep; including both visitors as well as locals. One tourist's balcony and the whole outside of the next-door building were covered in noisy grasshoppers. Beach lifeguards described the rare event as a ""surprise that was not needed"" and which they hope will run out as soon as possible.

While someone else reported they took over a beach - engulfing the sunbeds and the umbrellas. The beach is now largely empty after apparently being abandoned by horrified bathers. The swarms of grasshoppers are believed to have come after strong gusts of the Garbino wind that have hit the area in recent days. The Garbino is a southwestern wind from northern Africa that brings Saharan sand as it blows. This is most likely what pushed the insects to move from the countryside to the coast, local experts said.

Meanwhile, in America, people are battling a similar situation as millions of Mormon crickets have invaded the town of Elko, Nevada as they enter their migratory phase. The insects don't sting or bite but they can cause widespread damage to crops and other vegetation. Their name comes from their invasion of the crops of Mormon settlers in Utah in the 1800s.

The plague of grasshoppers that moved into northwestern Utah late last month was so large it was picked up by the National Weather Service. The plague-like surge at the end of June headed northeast toward the Great Salt Lake before hitting Tooele, Utah leaving farmers with destroyed crops.

""Every bit of alfalfa that's in my fields is gone. I planted a pasture and all the seedlings were about 3/4 of an inch tall Sunday morning, and on Sunday evening, they were gone, it was bare dirt"", rancher Michael Dow told KSLTV. Scientists were able to recognise the radar movement in Utah as grasshoppers because weather events like rain and snow tend to be more consistent in shape, meteorologist Alex DeSmet told the Salt Lake Tribune. ""This is not a common thing"", State entomologist Kris Watson, who manages Utah's insect and pest program at the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food, said.

Sleep experts have shared what people's most common dream is - and it's been keeping people up at night Googling what it really means when it crops up at night

As you wake up from a dream, it can feel like a bizarre and surreal moment, trying to convince yourself that what just happened wasn't true. Dreaming is something we all do - but sometimes dreams can reoccur and they're a good telltale as to what's going on in our subconscious mind. Sleep experts and psychologists can spend hours analysing dreams and what they really mean and it can take you a while to shake off the memories of what happened - leaving us wondering what the meaning behind it was.

Sleep experts at MattressNextDay have revealed what the most common dream we have is, and after conducting a large-scale study and analysing dream-related Google searches. They have found that Brits' most common dream is thinking their teeth have fallen out - most commonly to happen in April.

Whilst we might forget most of our dreams once we wake up, thought to be because of what happens to us during the rapid eye movement sleep stage (REM). Dreaming of your teeth falling out has been the one to keep people up and Googling what it can mean. Other common dreams we may have are - falling into a hole, being chased, being naked in public and being chased too.

Commenting on this, the dreams expert Inbaal Honigman explained: ""Teeth are a sign of life's ages and stages. We are born with none, go through two sets in childhood and adulthood, and start to lose them again in old age. Dreaming about losing teeth is natural since it's a rite of passage that we've all gone through. It's a dream that symbolises loss, like leaving a relationship behind or even moving house.""

It's estimated we can dream up to six times a night, for up to two hours a time, and f you're curious about delving deeper into dreams and working out what they might mean, a dream decoder and spirituality expert has shared her top tips for doing just this with The Mirror.

Theresa Cheung has been researching and writing about dreams for the last 25 years and is best known for her book, The Dream Dictionary. She believes that dream 'decoding' can be like a ""free form of therapy"" as it allows you space to understand yourself better.

""The first way to interpret them is to ask yourself how does this scenario make you feel and the purpose of that is to help you understand yourself better. All counselling and therapy try to do is to help you understand who you are - and your dreams are doing that for free every single night.

""The big stumbling block people have is that they don't understand their dreams because dreams speak in a different language and the first task you have to do is try and work it out. The language is very basic to who we are as human beings, it's all symbols and metaphors and figurative language association.""

Looking to buy a loved one a bottle of perfume this Christmas? Here are our top picks as selected by a former employee based on this year's bestsellers and deals

Perfume is usually pretty high up on every woman's Christmas wish list - but without specific brands listed, picking one out or surprising your loved one with something new can be a daunting task. It's an incredibly personal and often intimate gift, so you've got to get it right - but how if you don't know where to start?

I previously worked on the Boots fragrance counter while I was at university, and over the course of four years, helped countless people test scents and find the perfect present for their mum, sister, wife, girlfriends or other lucky lady in their life. So who better to make some solid recommendations than someone who was slinging bottles through the till for four years on the trot?

This December, Boots are predicted to sell more than one bottle of perfume or aftershave every single second throughout the month, which we expect will lead to a lot of happy recipients come the 25th.

When it comes to aftershave, Sauvage has topped the list of Boots bestsellers for a second year running, but as for women's scents, there's one brand - rather than a particular perfume - that crops up a lot more than others.

The health and beauty retailer told The Mirror they have sold one bottle of fragrance every four seconds throughout 2023, and among some of the most popular are various scents from luxury fragrance and fashion house Chanel.

The number one bestselling perfume for women so far at Boots this year has been Chanel Coco Mademoiselle, which is unsurprising as it's a total classic, incredibly elegant and timeless. I actually got my first bottle of this in 2015 for winning a competition at work, and it's remained a firm favourite in my fragrance wardrobe ever since. A 35ml bottle will currently set you bag £71 at Boots, with notes of fresh orange, jasmine and rose, with hits of patchouli and vetiver at the base.

It's racked up a 4.8 star rating on the Chanel website, with one commenting: ""My absolute favourite perfume. Coco mademoiselle is so subtle feminine and fresh.even after a full day people comment on the lovely sent I'm wearing.""

Another added: ""WOW I just love this perfume but having the big one is something else,"" though a third penned: ""The fragrance is light, floral and fresh. It's perfect for summer and daily wear. It stays for quite a long period of time which is an added bonus. Overall it's a beautiful combination of fragrance, but something feels like it's missing from the scent.""

Chanel's Bleu De Chanel made it in at number four of the top 10 bestsellers, proving the brand is popular with the gents, too, but lower down the list, there are two more Chanel scents that remain a hit with shoppers.

In at number eight, Chanel Chance offers an aroma of pink pepper, jasmine and amber patchouli alongside white musks and vanilla. Meanwhile, Chanel No5 sneaks in at number 10, renowned for its powerful ylang-ylang and neroli scent paired with warm vanilla, vetiver and sandalwood.

Other bestselling Boots scents this year so far include Dior's Miss Dior, La Vie Est Belle from Lancome, and Marc Jacobs Daisy, which we named our Mirror Choice best perfume for mums. It has over 1,100 five star reviews from shoppers who say they ""˜get so many compliments' when they wear it. Another wrote: ""Bought this for my mum, her favourite fragrance . Delighted it had £10 off too.""

A third said: ""My mum is in her 50s and also likes this perfume so it is suitable for people of all ages, not a specific ""young"" or ""old"" smell."" While a fourth said it was ""˜not as strong as other Marc Jacobs' but ""˜still beautiful'.

And if your loved one is a fan of Black Opium, might I suggest trying its lighter, fresher sister fragrance - YSL Black Opium Illicit Green Eau de Parfum 75ml. Said to be perfect for both day and nighttime wear, the perfume has been reduced from £105 to £52.50 as part of the retailer's star gifts.

The half-price fragrance offers a ""˜fresh, vibrant take' on the iconic YSL scent, boasting a ""˜captivating floral gourmand scent' with the signature black coffee base that Black Opium is renowned for, infused with zesty green mandarin and creamy fig resulting in a ""˜mocktail-inspired' spritz.

Other fragrances I'd recommend for the women in your life include:

Jo Malone Peony & Blush Suede - £55 for 30ml at LookFantastic

Paco Rabanne Lady Million - £78 for 50ml at Boots

Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb - £65 for 30ml at Boots

YSL Libre Eau de Parfum - £92 for 50ml at Boots

Prada Paradoxe Eau de Parfum - £55.25 for 30ml at LookFantastic (was £65)

Paco Rabanne OlympÃ©a For Women Eau De Parfum - £56 for 30ml at Boots

ChloÃ© Signature Refillable Eau de Parfum - £22.60 for 20ml on Notino (was £41)

Carolina Herrera Good Girl - £51 for 30ml at LookFantastic (was £60)

If after all that, you're still a bit stumped and still can't choose, Boots actually has a fragrance finder where you can input someone's favourite brands and fragrances, and it will recommend alternatives. Or you can add scent notes and it will tell you which perfumes will appeal.

PS Plus Essential subscribers will also get Weird West and Farming Simulator 22 in this month's lineup

The PS Plus October 2023 free games are releasing later this week for Essential subscribers, including the appropriately spooky The Callisto Protocol.

PS Plus Essential subscribers are in for a scare this month as 2022's The Callisto Protocol - a spiritual successor to the Dead Space series - is leading the October 2023 PS Plus Essential lineup. The Callisto Protocol was directed by Dead Space creator Glen Schofield and follows a pilot who crash lands on the planet Callisto and is taken to a high-security space prison in which inmates have contracted a mysterious illness. As you can expect from a game with Dead Space in its DNA, things do not go well, and you're forced to fight your way through the station.

For those looking for something not quite as scary, there's Weird West, an RPG from RaphaÃ«l Colantonio - the co-creator of the Dishonored series under Bethesda - and WolfEye Studios. The game deals with the occult during the Old West era, and takes cues from the classic Fallout games. If space horror or an occult western isn't your thing, there's always Farming Simulator 22, which - as the name implies - is a simulation of a farmer's life. You'll partake in the harvesting and selling of crops, as well as making sure your equipment is in top condition.

October PS Plus Essential games release time

The three games included in PS Plus Essential will be redeemable on Tuesday at 10am BST / 5am EDT / 2am PDT. Every single month the PS Plus Essential titles are released on the first Tuesday of the month and for October, this lands on Tuesday, October 3.

The PS Plus section on the PlayStation website may take a while to update and show these titles as available for PS4 and PS5 consoles, however, if you search for the games individually, you should be able to redeem them. When a new batch of PS Plus Essential titles arrives, that means it's time for the previous batch to go away, so make sure to redeem the PS Plus Essential September 2023 titles (Saints Row, Generation Zero, and Black Desert - Traveler Edition) to your library before then.

The PS Plus free games for October 2023 will be available until the November games. So you'll have until Tuesday, November 7 to add The Callisto Protocol, Farming Simulator 22, and Weird West to your library.

Even if you don't have a cat yourself, you want to ensure that neighbour's cats, or strays, don't feel like making themselves at home in yours - and this is how

While it's a lovely luxury to have a garden, it can often result in animals coming in and making it their own. One particular menace can be cats as when they poop in your garden, it means they're marking their territory and will likely return to do it again.

Not only is it unsightly but it can also wreak havoc on flower beds, crops and borders. Even though their mess might be easy enough to get rid of, it actually poses a bigger problem than just being a nuisance. Unfortunately, because cats are carnivores, it means their faeces contain parasites.

Their faeces can carry a host of infections which can then be transferred to your or the rest of your household. This can include the likes of toxoplasmosis and cryptosporidiosis - and the symptoms aren't pretty. Toxoplasmosis symptoms include headaches, fever, muscle aches and pains and swollen lymph glands, especially around the neck. Severe toxoplasmosis can even cause damage to the brain, eyes, or other organs. Meanwhile, cryptosporidiosis can cause diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, and a host of other problems.

To see if a cat has been in your garden, you need to look out for holes in the flower beds, small mounds of soil and paw prints. While deterring cats from gardens can be difficult, it thankfully isn't impossible. Carlos Garcia, son of the founders of Total Clean, has shared how to stop cats from pooping in gardens.

""Cats can be discouraged from using your garden as a litter box by placing rough materials like pinecones or chicken wire on the soil's surface,"" he told Express.co.uk. ""You can also plant strong-smelling herbs like rosemary or lavender, as cats dislike the scents. Motion-activated sprinklers are also a great way to startle cats away from the area.""

Another great option is putting crushed-up eggshells in soil, as it can feel unappealing under a cat's paws. As an added bonus, it will keep other pests like slugs away from plants too. Cats will be discouraged if there is a natural barrier made of twigs and branches between the plants as well. They like nothing more than freshly turned over, soft soil so ensuring soil is hard and uncomfortable should keep cats at bay.

Rivers in the Horn of Africa are usually in full flow, but a devastating drought caused primarily by climate change has left villagers without water for drinking, cooking and washing - and killed off crops and livestock

The devastating drought tearing through the Horn of Africa would not have happened if it wasn't for human-driven climate change.

The region has been left completely devoid of water - forcing desperate families to dig several metres into arid river beds to find a trickle - after months of failed rainy seasons delivered the worst drought in 40 years.

The situation has also driven conflict, with more than four million people now in need of humanitarian aid.

A cohort of 19 researchers from seven countries studied if climate change was to blame, ruling that the longer rainy season has become drier, while the short rainy season has become wetter all due to changes in global temperatures.

They branded the drought ""one of a kind"", adding that climtae change had made agricultural drought one hundred times more likely.

They added: ""Ongoing devastating drought would not have happened at all without the effect of greenhouse gas emissions"".

Head meteorologist at the Kenya Meteorological Department Joyce Kimutai said: ""Climate change has made the drought exceptional.""

The study group from the World Weather Attribution group analysed historical weather data - which included changes in the region's two primary rainfall patterns.

The scientists did concede that high temperatures, conflict, fragile statehood and poverty, were also to blame.

The United Nations said more than 20 million people in Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda and South Sudan have been affected by the drought.

In Somalia and Ethiopia there is an added risk to thousands of expectant or breastfeeding women.

Friederike Otto, senior climate scientist at Imperial College London and the leader of the study, said it underscored how climate change's effects ""strongly depend on how vulnerable we are.""

Rod Beadle, head of relief and humanitarian affairs at Food for the Hungry, said almost 15 million children are exposed to acute malnourishment.

""Despite the recent rains in North Kenya, the pressure from previous failed seasons makes for a dire situation. The flooding has impacted livestock and many pastoralists lost their primary livelihoods. The drought conditions have resulted in severely compacted soil that cannot absorb the water; hence the floods are more severe. The country is also facing severe outbreaks of cholera and other diseases as more refugees arrive,"" Beadle said.

Development gains in the countries have been offset by a long history of natural disasters, famine and disease, said Guyo Malicha Roba, a food security expert who heads the Jameel Observatory, which works on food insecurity issues in dryland nations.

Roba said the food situation in the region's drylands has addressed by raising money and with food distributions from governments and humanitarian partners, but more work needs to be done to use early-warning systems to respond more quickly to ""food shocks.""

The clips of the presenter will give a striking comparison of the current habitat in Uganda, East Africa, when they are aired in this weekend's episode

A chimpanzee sits in a farmer's field near its shrinking forest where David Attenborough hung out with chimps 33 years ago.

Archive clips of Sir David will give a striking comparison of the current habitat in Uganda, East Africa, when they are aired in tomorrow evening's episode of Planet Earth III. Footage from Trials of Life in 1990 show the BBC star, then 64, metres away from the group of chimps in thick forest, telling viewers of ""a peaceful scene of jungle harmony"".

But in Planet Earth III: Forests, Sir David, 97, tells how the habitat in Bulindi has been decimated for farmland and of the animals dodging traffic to gather food. Sir David tells viewers that only a few patches of their habitat remains, so they have started to ""go against their natural instincts"" by approaching humans in order to find food.

To do so, they have to dodge traffic while crossing the road to gather fruit from the gardens of the 200 or so families who live nearby. The episode's director Abigail Lees said: ""The ""˜Making of' starts with a younger David in a forest in Uganda, observing chimps in their natural habitat. For me, it was interesting to see how wild and untouched the forest looked in that archive footage. My experience couldn't have been further from Sir David's encounter.

""Every day, I stood at the side of a busy main road as wild chimpanzees crossed the frontier into the human world - villages and fields that were once jungle. The footage captured across Sir David's expansive career almost acts like a barometer for change in the natural world.""

One resident says they are attempting to co-exist happily. ""They know us by our faces and we know them by their faces,"" she says. The chimps are not always great neighbours though - stealing crops, chasing farmyard animals and scaring pets. ""Chimps can be dangerous,"" Sir David says. ""Living alongside them can be a mixed experience.""

He asks: ""As we continue to break our connections with them, the question is for how much longer will they survive. Surely the time has come to rebuild them?"" The aim, in the region, is to achieve a peaceful coexistence. ""There is hope,"" he says. ""They have managed, just about, to carve out a place for themselves in this changing world.""

The jogger was surrounded by a herd of cows and head-butted on the Meadowlark Trail in Colorado, US. It caused her to fall and she soon stopped moving, according to an eyewitness

A jogger who was head-butted and trampled on by a herd of cows has been rushed to hospital with serious injuries.

The frightening incident happened on the Meadowlark Trail in Colorado, US, while out running over the weekend, according to a Boulder Park Country Parks & Open Space spokesperson.

Vivian Kuenn, who was biking down the hill when the jogger was running along the trail, said she saw a herd of cows surround the woman before she started screaming.

She told 9News: ""She screamed and was just down on the ground while they were just trampling her.

""In a very short span of time she stopped moving. At that time I thought, oh gosh, did I just watch her die? Which thankfully wasn't the case.""

Vivienne Jannatpour, Boulder County Parks and Open Space spokesperson, told CBS: ""It was a surprise, but we do know mother cows can get agitated.""

Meanwhile, a second runner was also head-butted by the cows in the week but thankfully the individual was not seriously injured.

According to officials, at the start of the trailhead, there's a sign which says ""Give cows space. They can be aggressive.""

Park staff believe the mothers were protecting their young when the scary incident happened.

Mike Foster, the agricultural division manager for Boulder County Parks and Open Space, said the department put up the sign as it is calving season.

He said: ""We want to inform the public and help reduce risk between, and interaction between, the public and livestock when they are out grazing. ""

Mr Foster revealed he helps manage 25,000 acres of land that the parks owns and releases properties to tenants.

He added the cows had been there long before the trail.

The manager said: ""Livestock can be very aggressive during calving season, and we are in calving season.

""Just like a momma bear elk or moose, a momma cow is going to be very protective of its young. And when they perceive a threat they are going to react to that threat.""

He doesn't believe the jogger did anything wrong as she stayed on the trail but if someone approaches cows quickly the animals may see it as a threat.

""What we advise is give cattle a wide berth,"" Mr Foster said. ""If cattle are standing on the trail it's better to run around and wait in your car for a little bit until cattle move off the trail.""

Due to the incidents, parts of the trail have now closed.

We asked readers if fireworks should be banned for the wellbeing of our pets ahead of Bonfire Night, and a majority of voters showed their support for the idea

Pet owners across the UK are preparing their furry friends for Bonfire Night this weekend - and we asked Mirror readers what they thought of the firework displays.

The RSPCA found that 69 percent of Brits take at least one measure to help their pet relax ahead of the explosive season, which includes playing classical music. Studies have shown that 45 percent of dogs - that's around 5.5 million in the UK - show signs of fear when they hear fireworks.

Dogs can hear twice as frequencies than humans, which means firework spectacles are much louder for them. In some cases, their reaction to the noise and flashes can cause an injury, and sometimes lead to death. Between October and January 2021, the RSPCA received 11,785 reports of animals in distress due to fireworks.

Around 68 percent of reports were animals impacted by private at-home backyard displays, which makes it ""impossible for neighbours to prepare their pets, horses and livestock properly"". We asked Mirror readers if they think fireworks should be banned for the safety and wellbeing of our pets - and 87 percent said ""˜Yes - they should be banned'.

Around 1,055 people took part in our poll, and a hefty 912 believe they should be prohibited. Voicing their opinions in the comments section, one reader wrote: ""Yes ban fireworks they are a waste of money, last a minute, smell bad and not only scare animals but also a lot of people too...I've never liked them anyway.""

Another shared: ""Should be banned full stop. For the sake of dogs & all wildlife & PTSD sufferers. They also pollute the environment and air. And in the wrong hands cause terrible injuries. Nothing good about them. I don't know why we celebrate Guy Fawkes night anyway . The fact that he FAILED at blowing up parliament isn't something to celebrate.""

A third penned: ""Yes ban the fireworks, my poor dog wees herself and shakes,"" while a fourth wrote: ""Yes they definitely should be banned as my cat is always scared when they go off but I don't understand why people buy fireworks as they aren't fun and very loud and a waste of money.""

Many expressed their support for licensed displays, but said the sale of fireworks should be completely banned to the public. Under the current law, adults over 18 can buy fireworks from registered sellers for private use from October 15 to November 10. You can also purchase them from 26 to 31 December and three days before Diwali and Chinese New Year. At other times you can only buy fireworks from licensed shops.

In the comments section, one reader stated: ""Yes very much so for animals, but humans too. A great many people don't like them. The sale of fireworks should be completely banned and only official licensed displays be allowed. Fireworks are used a weapons, and even when not people are injured by them every year. Fireworks cause pollution and when it goes on night after night it's just awful.""

A second agreed: ""I fully support firework displays, but feel fireworks should not be sold generally. In the wrong hands it can be dangerous and disruptive. Our JR is a rescue dog, before we moved to our present home,we lived close to other houses and there were fireworks being let off every night for two weeks, she was terrified, now we live miles from anyone and she doesn't suffer from it.""

Another wrote: ""Sales to be general public should be banned. Fireworks are set off in back gardens (and the street, the park, at bus stops and such) randomly by people who do not always handle them wisely and, indeed, actually weaponise them. We've all seen the reports of emergency services being targeted, not to mention ordinary individuals being assaulted. Putting explosive devices happily into the hands of children or aggressive people should be ceased.""

Meanwhile, nine percent voted for ""˜No - they shouldn't be banned' in our poll, as one reader wrote: ""No, it's up to pet owners to introduce them to sounds and noises, so they are not alarmed when it happens. It's not difficult, but people choose not to and can't be bothered, then moan the pet is scared.""

A second wrote: ""So don't ban fireworks. 5th November, bonfire night has always been looked forward to by children - almost as much as Christmas! Part of our historic culture! It's down to their owners to keep them away from the noise.""

""Nope. It's a joint responsibility, pet owners and those wishing to let off fireworks. Nobody's individual rights are more important than another's. We live in a community made up of individuals; tolerance and respect is always better than heavy handed selfishness,"" noted a third.

Only four percent voted for ""˜Other' in our poll, with one reader suggesting ""˜silent fireworks' should be introduced. ""A few years ago I joined a campaign to introduce silent fireworks because everyone loves the spectacular visual display of a firework but not the noise it makes! Perhaps this is something that needs further development??,"" they shared.

You can still vote in the poll HERE to have your say on whether fireworks should be banned. Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below.

WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: The unnamed 14-year-old had been experiencing headaches and vomiting for a month before the gruesome discovery in India and reported in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)

A teenager has miraculously escaped death after a parasitic tapeworm was found on his brain.

The unnamed 14-year-old had been experiencing headaches and vomiting for a month before the gruesome discovery.

He was rushed to hospital where doctors performed an MRI scan, revealing a massive cyst.

The schoolboy, from India, was diagnosed with a form of echinococcosis, an infectious disease caused by tapeworms and it's believed he contracted this after being in contact with infected livestock or dog faeces.

After undergoing a craniotomy, where a small hole is cut in the skull, revealing the brain, the large cyst was successfully removed.

Video footage shows doctors gently separating the cyst wall from the brain to avoid rupture.

According to local reports, the boy returned to school and resumed normal activities two weeks after being discharged - but the situation could have been fatal if left untreated.

The case study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).

In another horror surgery case, a five-year-old boy complaining of an ""ear infection"" turned out to have a battery lodged in his throat for five weeks.

Luke McMillan, from Arizona, US, was an energetic little toddler who was prone to the odd ear infection as he would often rub his ears.

Mum Erica McMillan took him to the doctors to get checked out and he was given antibiotics and told the infection will eventually clear up.

He seemed to get better and was on the up, however, Luke was struggling to swallow solid foods as he would bring them back up.

Luke's parents decided to switch his diet from solids to liquids to make sure he was still able to eat.

Erica told The State: ""We just assumed it was a side effect because he's kind of done that before where he doesn't really want to eat anything.""

And on Valentine's Day, it was reported that a dad's leg ""snapped in half"" after awkwardly landing on a trampoline.

Ryan Schelin, 30, had taken his kids to DEFY Boise trampoline park in Nampa, Idaho, US, when he challenged himself to bounce high enough to touch the top of a 12ft padded wall.

But in shocking footage, which has since gone viral, the dad-of-three is seen raising his hands during a mid-air celebration as he achieves the feat to the delight of his cheering family.

However, 18-stone Ryan then ""loses concentration"" and lands with all his weight on his right leg - causing it to ""buckle"" under the pressure and ""snap"" with a loud crack.

Ryan said the accident left him able to ""fold his leg in half"" and see the bones sticking out of his flesh.

After being blue-lighted to hospital he was forced to undergo surgery where a metal rod was inserted to hold the two broken bones together for the rest of his life.

Ryan's wife Shandra Schelin, 30, has since banned him and their three children from playing on a trampoline again.

Siblings Alice and Nellino lived as outcasts in the home in Veneto, Italy without electricity or running water. Every inch of their home was adorned with murals and statues

A house that looks like something from the fairytale Hansel and Gretel was built by two reclusive siblings, who were rumoured to have lured children into their enchanted garden.

Carved princess statues adorn the outside of the house and murals cover every wall depicting scenes from classic fairytales.

The house in Veneto, Italy was home to two siblings named Alice and Nellino.

The two brothers were both teachers and artists.

The siblings were reclusive, living as outcasts without electricity, gas or running water. They lived solely off the produce they grew and the livestock they kept.

Alice and Nellino transformed their home into a fairytale wonderland, painting and sculpting fable characters into every inch of their home - with images of Sleeping Beauty, Pinocchio and other mythical creatures such as goblins, elves and dwarfs.

The two even decorated their unused TV with images of the famous singers Luciano Pavarotti and Katia Ricciarelli.

Like something out of a fairytale, rumours circled that they would enchant their garden to capture and eat children, becoming akin to the witch from Hansel and Gretel.

It is believed that the remains of the siblings were buried in a communal grave in their back garden.

These images were taken by technical writer and urban explorer Federico Limongelli, also known as Tesori, in the Paduan countryside.

He said: ""They transformed their home into a fairytale world where fantasy reigned over everything.

""Their art was transferred to everything around them: they painted the walls with imaginative subjects and decorated every nook and cranny with strange beings.

""Alice had a quite eccentric style, in fact, she always sewed the clothes that she wore and she loved to wear them with heels even if she was always relegated to the house.

""Nelly, on the other hand, occasionally went to the village to make small purchases, such as the material needed to make their creations.

""Due to their extravagance and their different lifestyle from the rest of the inhabitants of the town they were labelled as 'weird' and various legends and rumours circulate about them, such as for example that the 'enchanted' garden served to attract children to their home, children who, once captured, were killed and eaten.

""It was also believed that the remains were buried in a mass grave in the back of the house.""

Experts say Britain's rats are becoming resistance to rodenticides, which have been used since the 1950s, and are thriving on the nation's calorie-laden fast food

Up to 300million ""super rats"" are feared to soon be plaguing the UK - after becoming obese eating fatty takeaway scraps.

Experts say the rodents are gorging on leftovers strewn on streets and overflowing bins as the nation's diet has become increasingly unhealthy.

It's believed rats have also grown resistant to rodenticides, which have been used since the 1950s.

Craig Morris, a pest controller with 15 years of experience, said: ""Rats are becoming more of an issue. They are one of nature's amazing survivors. They have exploited everything we do and done it really well.

""What might sound horrific to most people is just an everyday occurrence to me, I'm afraid.""

The 53-year-old man, who operates across Hampshire, Dorset and Wiltshire, told Daily Star poor sanitation and hygiene has also led to the boom in rat population recently.

But the country's dependence on calorie-laden fast food is also behind the surge, Mr Morris said.

Last month, a McDonald's customer was left horrified after spotting up to seven rats climbing in and out of a bin in the car park of a Hull restaurant.

Scenes like this have concerned ecology researchers.

Steve Belmain, a professor of ecology at the Natural Resources Institute at Greenwich University, London, said of the UK's rat numbers: ""I could easily imagine 200 to 300 million rats here.""

Prof Belmain is aiding a project in which rats are being trapped across livestock farms in Norfolk and Essex to test for the prevalence of disease.

It is happening because a study in December last year claimed around 78 per cent of rats had developed genetic resistance to anticoagulants.

The biggest rat on record to have been caught in Britain, by a Bournemouth pest hunter in 2018, measured 21 inches in length - as big as a small dog.

A doctor treating the tuberculosis patient warned of a 'public health catastrophe' as the Home Office came under pressure to explain why it's not managed to stop Channel crossings

An asylum seeker with tuberculosis has been told they are set to be moved onto the Bibby Stockholm barge. Other migrants to be put on the vessel include those waiting for surgery and mental health support.

A doctor treating the TB patient warned of a ""public health catastrophe"". It mounts pressure on the Home Office to assure the barge's safety with concerns already rife about potential outbreaks of diseases such as scabies and diphtheria, which have been detected in other migrant accommodation.

Dr Dominik Metz, a GP for more than 250 asylum seekers in Oxfordshire, told the i newspaper one of his patients who is under ""active treatment"" for latent TB is to be housed on the Bibby Stockholm. In total, 10 of his patients have received letters from the Home Office notifying them they are to be moved to the barge, which is docked in Portland Port in Dorset. He said the department is unable to access medical records so are not aware of people's conditions before they are transferred.

Dr Metz warned against relocating sufferers as he said latent TB can become active - and contagious - if treatment is interrupted. ""It's extremely disruptive for patients but also extremely wasteful in terms of NHS resources,"" he added. ""If they've been through a process already and been seen by specialists, that's going to get disrupted. There's also potential public health implications if treatment for TB is stopped part way through.""

He has contacted the Government to tell them the 222-room barge, which is set to house 500 migrants in rooms of up to six people, would be medically inappropriate. ""I feel they are being treated like livestock, only slightly worse, as livestock are prohibited from being transported with active infection,"" he said.

Migrant crossings reached the highest number in a single day for the year so far as figures confirmed over 100,000 people have made the journey in the past five years. The first 15 migrants moved onto the Bibby Stockholm barge on Monday.

Since current records began on January 1 2018, 100,715 people have arrived in the UK after making the journey. The milestone was reached after 755 people crossed the Channel on Thursday in 14 boats - the highest daily number so far this year.

The numbers were recorded as a major search and rescue operation was launched after 17 migrants went overboard and were pulled from the water. The Home Office said they were all taken ashore for medical checks.

Tory immigration minister Robert Jenrick this week threatened that the UK could ditch a major international human rights agreement to help tackle the small boat crisis. Leaving the European Convention on Human Rights would mean the UK sits alongside countries such as Russia and Belarus who are already out of it. It would fuel accusations that Rishi Sunak is weak and unable to stand up to hardliners in the Tory Party.

Treasury minister John Glen today said he does not back the UK leaving the European Convention on Human Rights. Asked on LBC's Nick Ferrari if he is in support of ""what we understand to be a growing sentiment within the Conservative Party that the United Kingdom should quit the European Convention on Human Rights"", Mr Glen said: ""No, because I believe in the plan that we've got in place. It hasn't finished the legal process yet.

""This is a Europe-wide problem. We've had a 30% increase in illegal immigration across Europe, but we're working with Turkey, new arrangement with them last week, with France, with Albania. The arrangements with France have led to 33,000 fewer crossings - also tougher fines for employers and landlords.

""We've got the Professional Enablers Task Force. We're working with media companies as well. So this is a multi-dimensional approach as well as the Immigration (Bill) which of course many criticised us for and it was a real battle to take through the Houses of Parliament. But we've got a legal challenge waiting on that, but I believe in plan A and we will see that come to fruition in the autumn.""

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the situation was getting ""worse and worse"". ""Small boat crossings have increased more than twentyfold over the last four years on the Conservatives' watch, with more than 100,000 people now having made the dangerous journey across the Channel,"" she said.

""The criminal gangs who profit from undermining our border security and putting lives at risk have continued to run rings around this Government, with their profits soaring from £1 million a few years ago to over £200 million today, while convictions have collapsed.

""After years of empty pledges and broken promises, the Tories' asylum chaos is just getting worse and worse. They cannot be trusted to get a grip. Only Labour has a serious plan to crack down on criminal smuggler gangs, tackle dangerous boat crossings, clear the asylum backlog and end hotel use by speeding up decisions and fast-tracking cases from safe countries.""

A Home Office spokeswoman said:""The welfare of asylum seekers being housed on the vessel in Portland is of the utmost priority.

""The Bibby Stockholm has an on-site medical facility to help mitigate the impact on local NHS services and we continue to work closely with health professionals and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) to ensure all appropriate health protocols are followed.""

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is feared to be heading towards Britain and France thanks to climate change and has a high mortality rate, according to experts

A virus running riot across Europe, Africa and the Middle East which is feared to be the biggest threat to the public could soon be found on Britain's shores.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF ) broke out in Iraq and Namibia and there have been cases in Spain as well as deaths recorded in Pakistan. An urgent health warning has already been issued in what has been described as the current biggest threat to public health and is feared to be accelerated by climate change .

Spread through ticks, the disease is caused by Nairovirus and according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and has a fatality rate of between 10 and 40 percent. Last week, insiders speaking to Parliament's Science, Innovation and Technology Committee revealed it was ""highly likely"" there could soon be cases in the UK.

During the hearing, James Wood, head of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University, said CCHF could find its way to the UK ""through our ticks, at some point"". The disease is feared to be expanding out of its usual territories and moving towards the likes of Britain and France because of climate change.

Symptoms of CCHF

Among the virus' symptoms include headaches , high fever, back and joint pain, stomach ache, and vomiting. Red eyes, a flushed face, a red throat, and petechiae (red spots) on the palate are also common.

In severe cases, WHO warns, jaundice, mood swings and sensory perception are encountered. As the illness progresses, large areas of severe bruising, severe nosebleeds, and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites can be seen, beginning on about the fourth day of illness and lasting for about two weeks.

In documented outbreaks of CCHF, fatality rates in hospitalised patients ranged from nine percent to as high as 50 percent. The long-term effects of CCHF infection have not been studied well enough in survivors to determine whether or not specific complications exist. However, recovery is slow.

How is it spread?

According to the WHO, human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from ""close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons"".

Concerningly, there is currently no vaccine available for either people or animals infected by the disease.

CCHF is transmitted to people by either bites from ticks or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues immediately after slaughter.

Hosts of CCHF include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep and goats.

According to the WHO, the majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.

Reported deaths

Iraq was reportedly in a major battle with the disease last year, with 212 incidents recorded between January 1 and May 22. Of those, 169 were reported between April and May alone.

Agence France-Presse added in May that almost 100 additional cases - and 13 deaths - were so far in 2023 attributed to the toll in Iraq.

Amelia Dyer, known as the Ogress of Reading, had some cold final words before being hanged for the death of an infant whose decomposing body was fished out the River Thames wrapped in brown paper

A woman deemed one of the most prolific female murderers in history had some callous last words before being hanged for the murder of one baby, despite being presumed to have a hand in the deaths of hundreds more.

Amelia Dyer worked as a baby farmer in Victorian England, caring for hundreds of babies under a variety of names. Until that is, a parcel weighted down with a brick was fished out of the River Thames in Reading on March 30, 1896.

What followed was an investigation that would uncover the crimes of one of the 19th Century's most notorious child killers. It resulted in a high-profile trial that shed light on the Victorian practice of baby farming.

Born in 1837 to a Bristol shoemaker, Dyer's childhood wasn't particularly easy as she was the primary carer for her mentally ill mother. She took a childhood of caring for others into adulthood as she became a nurse.

However, instead of caring for her charges, she used her career and position to do the exact opposite. In Victorian England, desperate single mothers were barred from the workhouse as they were believed to be immoral. The Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 made it so fathers of illegitimate children, those born outside of marriage, were not obligated by law to offer financial support.

It left women with stark options of selling themselves in sex work, starving, or, thanks to baby farms, quietly getting rid of their babies. Baby farmers would offer to take the children off the poor women's hands, offering the child an alternative future to one of starvation and potential ill health as a result that potentially faced them if they stayed with their mothers.

This was the role to which Dyer stepped into. Recently widowed and with a daughter to support herself, she began advertising her services in local papers in 1869. One read: ""Married couple with no family would adopt healthy child, nice country home. Terms - £10.""

While baby farmers would often operate under the guise that the children would be well taken care of and provided better futures, the reality was far more grim. Dyer assured clients the children under her care would be given a safe and loving home, but instead, children were left to die from starvation and neglect.

She used an opium-laced syrup called 'Mother's Friend' to keep the children quiet as they felt the effects of starvation and their bodies began shutting down. While this was the fate of many of the first children Dyer looked after, she soon began to develop quicker methods to kill the children to bring in more money.

Dyer, who became known as the Ogress of Reading, travelled across the country, from homes in Bristol and Reading to Liverpool and Plymouth. She would charge between £10 and £80 for her services, which equates to between £1,000 and £8,000 in today's money. Most babies left in her care died within days, or in some cases, even hours.

Eventually, authorities grew suspicious of Dyer's baby farms after a doctor noticed a high number of babies dying in her care. Unfortunately, in Victorian England, infant mortality rates were high, which meant many of the baby's deaths went unnoticed.

After the deaths were looked into, Dyer was charged with neglect and sentenced to six months of hard labour. When she was released, she learned from her initial conviction, but not in the way authorities had hoped. Instead of returning to society a reformed woman, she instead learnt from her previous actions that got her caught and changed her operating style.

Dyer returned to baby farming but this time she did not involve doctors and began to dispose of the bodies herself to avoid any added risk. After a brief spell in Cardiff, she relocated to Reading in 1895 and began to dispose of the babies' bodies in the River Thames.

She relocated frequently, operating out of multiple baby farms to avoid rousing any suspicion and began using aliases. But her method of disposing of the bodies herself eventually led to her downfall after an infant's body was recovered from the River Thames.

Inside a brown paper parcel, swaddled in layers of linen, newspaper and brown paper, was the partially decomposed body of baby Helena Dry. She had white tape wound around her neck, with a knot under the left ear.

As police investigated the crime, Detective Constable James Beattie Anderson took a closer look at the packaging. The packaging, now on display at the Thames Valley Police Museum in Reading, held a clue - a Midland Railway stamp dated October 24 1895 marked Bristol Temple Meads.

But even more crucial was a smudged name and address. That belonged to Mrs Thomas of 26 Piggott's Road, Caversham - Dyer's married name and former address.

When Detective Constable Anderson got to the town, neighbours informed him she had moved to Kensington Road in Reading. Here, he found piles of baby clothing and numerous receipts from adverts in papers from across the country. During searches of her addresses, detectives were overcome with the stench of human remains, though no bodies were found.

White tape, identical to that found around Helena's neck, was also uncovered. On April 3, 1896, four days after Helena's body was found, Dyer was arrested and charged with having feloniously killed a child.

The Rivers Thames and Kennett were dredged, resulting in six more babies being found, all with the same tape around their necks. One parcel found near Clappers Pond held a particularly gruesome discovery for Detective Constable Anderson.

The corpse was found to be that of a female child, aged around 12 months. But she was in such an advanced state of decomposition that when the parcel was opened, the body and head fell to pieces.

On May 22, 1896, Dyer appeared at the Old Bailey for trial. She pleaded insanity, having previously been committed to asylums in Bristol. But prosecutors argued the 57-year-old's exhibitions of mental instability were merely a ploy to avoid suspicion.

While the true scale of her crimes is hard to estimate, eyewitnesses recalled seeing Dyer take as many as six babies a day into her home. Given she worked as a baby farmer for around 30 years, it's plausible then that she was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of children.

It took a jury less than five minutes to reach a guilty verdict. Though she pleaded guilty to just one murder, it's estimated she likely killed between 200 and 400 children. She spent three weeks in a cell awaiting her execution, during which time she filled five books with her ""last true and only confession"".

A chaplain is said to have visited her the night before her execution, asking if she had anything to confess. It's said Dyer offered him the books, saying ""Isn't this enough?""

On Wednesday, June 10, just before 9am, Dyer was hanged. As she stood on the scaffold with the noose around her neck, she was asked if she had any final words. Callously she replied: ""I have nothing to say"".

As a result of Dyer's case, adoption laws were made stricter, giving local authorities the power to police baby farms in the hope of stamping out abuse. However, the trafficking and abuse of infants did not end with Dyer's case. An undercover investigation of baby farming reported in 1870 in a letter to The Times, concluded: ""My conviction is that children are murdered in scores by these women, that adoption is only a fine phrase for slow or sudden death.""

Baby farming began being regulated in 1872 with the passage of the Infant Life Protection Act 1872. The Infant Life Protection Act 1897 finally empowered local authorities to control the registration of nurses responsible for more than one infant under five for more than 48 hours. A series of acts passed over the next 70 years gradually placed adoption and foster care under the protection and regulation of the state

Farmer Kim Norman Rendall is facing jail after he was filmed dragging his white husky Daisy behind his red Nissan Micra - she had to be put down as her injuries were so severe

A farmer allegedly told locals ""I'll do what I want"" when he was confronted for dragging his dog behind his car before leaving her to die.

Kim Norman Rendall, from Somerset, is facing jail after he was filmed pulling his white husky Daisy with a rope for around 200 metres. The cruel act was witnessed by several motorists who tried to stop the 65 year old by honking and flashing their lights at his red Nissan Micra, Daisy was left severely injured from the incident on the afternoon of April 17, and sadly had to be put down as she couldn't recover.

Despite this, Rendall refused to seek help for his injured dog or tell the police where he had left her when they arrived at his home, where he was found having a cup of tea and a haircut. After the case, the RSPCA released a shocking video showing Daisy being dragged along the road in Timsbury, near Bath. North Somerset Magistrates' Court heard how one motorist shouted ""dog, dog"" out of a window, leading a woman to flag the car down.

Rendall stopped and was immediately confronted by upset locals as Daisy bled onto the road and tried to stand up, reports Somerset Live. One woman offered to take Daisy to the vet for urgent care if he wasn't going to. He laughed and said: ""I'll do what I want, it's my dog."" Lundi Meyer, prosecuting, said he drove for about 200 metres, and around 55 seconds. After removing a bin from his car, he put Daisy in the boot and drove off. The police were called and officers arrived at his mum's house within an hour.

The farmer was found there having a cup of tea and a haircut. He wouldn't tell the police where Daisy was and said he would take her to the vet himself. Because of the urgency, he was arrested on suspicion of animal cruelty. In response, he said: ""I don't like this at all, I don't like this at f**king all"". In custody, it was noted that his trainers were covered in blood. He was rude and aggressive towards the officers.

Meanwhile, 18 police officers and a drone unit were looking for Daisy to get her the urgent treatment she needed. After a two and a half hour search in the Somerset countryside, she was found in a cow barn in Gossard Lane, High Littleton. She was rushed to Rosemary Lodge Veterinary Hospital in Bath in a police car with blue lights and sirens. The vets said she had serious injuries, including both back legs suffering full-thickness skin loss and an open fracture of her foot.

Despite the best efforts of vets to treat Daisy, her pain could not be controlled and she was put to sleep nine days later. Ms Meyer said the incident has ""clearly has had a lasting affect on people"", including witnesses and police officers. It was heard how one witness ""fell to the floor and went into shock"" following the incident and was prescribed Diazepam by her GP due to being unable to sleep.

PC Natalie Cosgrove described Daisy's injuries as ""the worst thing I have ever seen"" and it made her ""feel physically sick"". ""I felt shocked, I couldn't sleep and I cried... I hugged my own dog crying in sympathy for Daisy"", she told the court in a victim person statement. She said that the dog's suffering was ""something that cannot be described"" and said she was ""traumatised"" when Rendall smirked in his police interview. PC Cosgrove added: ""I just felt incredibly sorry for her, that a human let her down so badly. This is one of those jobs that will haunt me forever.""

Ms Meyer told the magistrates that Rendall's refusal to provide Daisy's whereabouts was ""sadistic"" and only prolonged her suffering. She added: ""He prioritised a haircut and a cup of tea over her medical attention"". At a previous hearing, Rendall pleaded guilty to two counts of causing the unnecessary suffering of an animal contrary to the Animal Welfare Act. Suggesting the starting point was two years in prison for his crimes, the magistrates agreed that their powers were likely to be insufficient, and sent the case to Bristol Crown Court for sentencing.

He was released on unconditional bail to appear on November 21.

Kaleb Cooper and Jeremy Clarkson have spent some time apart after the Top Gear presenter ventured off to film a new series of The Grand Tour


Kaleb Cooper has said he feels ""love"" for Jeremy Clarkson and admitted missing the former Top Gear host when he went off to film motoring TV series The Grand Tour.

The farming contractor has been known to bicker with the TV presenter, 63, on Prime Video's reality show Clarkson's Farm, which sees Cooper help Clarkson with the day-to-day running of Diddly Squat farm.

Speaking in The Times about their friendship, the breakout star of Clarkson's Farm Cooper said: ""I resented Jeremy slightly the first time I met him but not because he had a farm ""” it was because he asked me to drive the tractor more slowly past his house so his cat could run around safely.

""I ignored that because we were so busy. And to be honest, I didn't know who he was. I didn't have time to watch TV. Sometimes the odd sports car would be delivered (for a motoring review) and I'd think, ""˜who's this flash git then?'. But we have become quite close now.


""He recently went off to Africa to film The Grand Tour and after a couple of days I actually missed him. He's been a father figure to me when it comes to understanding TV. I've learned from the best there is and ""” I can't believe I'm saying this ""” when he's not pissing me off, there is love there.""

Asked if he would ever take ownership of Clarkson's farm, he said: ""What? Are you joking? No way! I don't want anything I haven't earned myself. Everything I've got I've worked bloody hard for, but I don't want or expect anything beyond that.""

Cooper has now penned his second book, Britain According To Kaleb: The Wonderful World Of Country Life, a follow-up to his bestseller The World According To Kaleb.

It's been a dramatic year for Cooper, who started 2023 by announcing his engagement to partner Taya. Breaking the news to followers, the star gushed: I honestly can't wait for 2023 and all the following years after that. @tayaaaxx your my best friend as well as the love of my life. Was a long wait for this (6 and a half years),"" he added. The in June this year the pair welcomed a daughter, a little sister to their son Oscar.

Cooper previously revealed he works 117 hour weeks on the farm to help out his hapless boss. He said Clarkson's knowledge of farming was 'dangerously' lacking.

In January this year, Clarkson revealed Cooper left the farm after his 'stupidest idea yet.' Clarkson said his dream to become a pig farmer led to a furious battle between them. He said: ""Cheerful Charlie Ireland, my land agent, says this is the stupidest idea I've had yet and wants no part of it. Kaleb was so unpleased that he got into his pick-up truck and went to Cornwall for a week.""

Clarkson's Farm has run for two series and another is on the way.

Wealthy pig farmer James Seales, 66, was jailed for life for the 2012 shotgun killing of Philip Strickland, 36, and has now lost an 'unusual' divorce battle with estranged wife Alison Seales, 55

The traumatised wife of a millionaire murderer has beaten him in a highly ""unusual"" divorce court fight for a £750,000 share of their fortune.

Wealthy pig farmer James Seales was convicted of the 2012 shotgun murder of Philip Strickland, despite claiming he had been at home watching Emmerdale at the time of the killing. Seales, 66, is currently behind bars serving a life sentence, with a minimum term of 15 years, which he was handed in April 2014, although he continues to proclaim his innocence.

And now he has come off worse in another court fight - this time over the assets of his marriage to estranged wife and mother of his kids, Alison Seales, 55. Mrs Seales - who was with her husband for 19 years - told a High Court judge that she is ""terrified"" of her violent ex and is ""psychologically scarred from her many years of living in an abusive relationship"" with him prior to his incarceration.

Now Judge Evan Bell has handed her a £750,000 share of their £1m fortune - rather than splitting the wealth equally - after ruling that Seales' ""conduct"" in ""the carrying out of a murder"" should lead to him getting a lesser share of the family money now that the divorce is being finalised. Murder victim Philip Strickland, 36, from Comber, Co Down, Northern Ireland, was killed on the evening of January 11, 2012, when he was blasted in the leg and face with a shotgun.

The trial heard that, following an assault on Seales in September 2011, graffiti about him appeared and comments were posted on Facebook which the family attributed to Mr Strickland. Seales, of Raffrey, Co Down, has always denied being at the scene of the killing and said he was at home watching Emmerdale, but the jury rejected his claim and convicted him of murder and of possessing a shotgun with intent.

Still behind bars nine years after he was sentenced, Seales represented himself in a divorce hearing last month, during which his wife's KC Adele O'Grady asked Judge Master Evan Bell to hand her an unusually large share of the family fortune due to the fact her husband is a killer. Ms O'Grady asked the judge to take into account the husband's murderous ""conduct"" as well as the negative effect that Mrs Seales says living in a relationship with him has had on her.

Judge Bell, sitting in the Family Division of the Northern Irish High Court, said in his ruling that Mrs Seales suffers from symptoms linked with post traumatic stress disorder. ""Her doctor's evidence was that there was no doubt that the wife had been psychologically scarred from her many years of living in an abusive relationship,"" he continued.

""She remains terrified of her husband and of the fact that he could persuade others to physically harm her. This is an unusual ancillary relief application. The wife had mounted what is usually described as 'a conduct case,' that is to say she submitted that there had been conduct by the husband, namely the carrying out of a murder, which would not be equitable for the court to disregard and should result in an additional portion of the assets being awarded to the wife in these proceedings.

""Both parties enjoyed a comfortable standard of living prior to the breakdown of the marriage. The marriage was of significant duration, having lasted some 19 years until the separation,"" he said, adding that the assets of the marriage amounted to around £1m, made up of £188,000 cash and two properties.

""The husband submitted that, given the length of the marriage, the appropriate outcome of this case was that the assets referred to above ought to be divided on a 50/50 basis. The husband considered that, firstly, I ought not to take into account his criminal conviction for murder and the consequences that the wife alleged flowed from it. Secondly, the husband also denied any domestic abuse of his wife"".

The judge found as a fact that the wife had suffered domestic abuse at the hands of Seales, pointing out the judge at his murder trial had been told by his sons that he was ""an angry wee man,"" finding they ""both had a miserable childhood under the thumb of your bullying, domineering father.""

""This view is, of course, entirely consistent with my...finding of the husband's domestic abuse of the wife,"" said Judge Bell. Giving evidence, Mr Seales had refused to accept that having her husband convicted of murder would have had a ""devastating effect"" on his wife or that she had been made a ""social pariah"" in her area.

""In my view, the consequences of the husband's involvement in the murder of Mr Strickland on the life and physical and mental health of the wife have been profound,"" the judge continued. ""I am also satisfied that the husband's conviction and its aftermath has had a profound impact on the wife's ability to earn a living. She gave evidence that she was not able to work due to her anxiety.

""At one stage she did get a job but said that she 'just fell to pieces.' She finds it difficult even to leave the house unless she is accompanied by someone else. After her husband was arrested she had a breakdown and regards herself as 'never right since then.' She told the court that life had been non-existent since then.

""The lack of gainful employment would obviously make it difficult for her to obtain a mortgage in the future. Unsurprisingly, she wants to move from the current matrimonial home. This case is, in my view, the paradigm example of a conduct case where the husband's conduct is so outrageous that it would be utterly inequitable to disregard it. I am therefore compelled to take both aspects of the husband's matrimonial conduct into account in the division of the matrimonial assets.

""The husband submitted that he deserved a 50% split of the family assets. He told the court that he was 66 years old, had two granddaughters to look after, and wanted to move on with his life when he was released from prison. He told me that, unlike his wife, he had no benefit from any of his assets for the past 12 years. On the other hand, counsel for the wife submitted that the appropriate division of the assets would be a 75% award to the wife and a 25% award to the husband.

""I consider that, in the light of my findings of fact in relation to the conduct of the husband, the appropriate decision in this case is that the assets of the parties shall be divided on the basis of 75% to the wife and 25% to the husband. This must not in any way be regarded as further punishment of the husband for the crime of murdering Mr Strickland. His punishment for that was delivered by the criminal courts.

""In reaching this ancillary relief decision, I have taken into account the conduct that the wife has suffered for many years, its impact on her physical and emotional health, and that I do not foresee the wife ever being able to engage in gainful employment, such has been the devastation to her well being.

""I therefore order that the two properties shall forthwith be placed on the market for sale and the net proceeds, together with the funds held by the solicitor, shall be divided in the way in which I have indicated."" The judge ordered that the £188,000 cash currently being held by solicitors ought to be released to the wife immediately.

Writing in the Mirror, Shadow Environment Secretary Jim McMahon accused Tory ministers of giving a green light to puppy smugglers, puppy farmers and pet thieves

I am proud of my party's record on animal welfare. The changes introduced by the last Labour government have left an indelible mark on British history and have stood the test of time, from the bans on fox-hunting and fur-farming to the action taken to stop experimentation on great apes and the testing of cosmetics on animals.

Most important of all, in the 2006 Animal Welfare Act, we introduced what a former Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Margaret Beckett, called ""the most significant and comprehensive proposal for animal welfare legislation for nearly a century"", transforming the protections of domestic animals in our country.

In opposition, we have maintained those proud traditions, from proposing legislation to ban the import of fur, to demanding that our farmers are not undercut by imported meat produced to lower standards abroad.

For the Labour Party, our belief in protecting animal welfare does not come and go depending on who is in what job, or what is politically convenient or fashionable at the time; it is a matter of principle and conviction.

Contrast all that with the current Conservative government; it has become impossible to say from one month to the next whether they are committed to animal welfare or not, or whether that commitment extends to introducing the legislation that they have promised.

The impact of Tory indifference towards animals is not by any means a new concept. The cost of living crisis has had a profound impact on pet owners, who face higher costs for pet essentials such as food and veterinary care.

The Kept Animals Bill was a flagship pledge in the Conservative 2019 manifesto and a key pillar of the subsequent Queen's Speech. In 2021, the necessary legislation was laid before Parliament. But last month, without any proper explanation - let alone an apology - it was suddenly scrapped.

With it have gone the protections that the legislation would have provided against puppy smuggling, puppy farming, pet theft and live animal exports.

This baffling decision is not a one-off. The same Conservative government has scrapped its plans to ban the import of foie gras, and instead of embracing the opportunity to become the first country in the world to ban the import of fur, the have kicked the proposal into the long grass.

The truth is that the Tories cannot decide whether animal welfare is important or not, they cannot decide whether it is popular with their members or not, and they cannot decide whether or not it merits taking on a few dissenting backbenchers and annoying a few special interest groups.

That kind of calculation and dither tells you everything you want to know about their level of commitment to this issue: there is no principle or conviction at work, not even the one that tells a government to keep the promises it made to voters.

As long as they remain in charge, those promises will mean nothing, and animals that could be protected from unnecessary suffering and cruelty will continue to fall victim to it instead.

That's why Labour will on Wednesday force a binding vote in the House Commons to re-introduce the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals Bill) that the Government controversially dropped just a few weeks ago.

More than ever, Britain remains a nation of animal lovers. We deserve better than a government that cannot make up its mind over whether it agrees.

Love Island stars Casey O'Gorman and Tom Clare lifted the lid on their friendship with Will Young six months on from leaving the Love Island villa, with not everything rosy between the trio these days

Love Island stars Casey O'Gorman and Tom Clare have grown distant from fellow Islander Will Young - as they claim the 24-year-old farmer from Buckinghamshire failed to put an effort into their friendship.

The trio who were contestants in the winter series of the ITV2 dating show were branded the three 'musketeers' after growing a solid friendship inside the villa. While Casey and Tom have broken up with their love interests since the show, Will and girlfriend Jessie Wynter continue to go strong.

The loved-up couple regularly post each other on their respective social media accounts, after Jessie moved across the world to be with Will. However, Love Island finalists Casey and Tom's bromance has flourished over the six months, with the pair moving together over the summer - but the duo have revealed their relationship with Will has hit the rocks.

""It's tough, a lot has happened since the show,"" Casey said on The Nikki & Brie Show podcast on Wednesday 4 October. Tom claims he reached out to Will to meet for a catch-up, but claims they ""got nothing back."" He said: ""There's only so much effort you can make with someone until you're like, 'Look, this guy is not making effort with me. I can't do it anymore.' It's a shame as we got on so well,"" he said.

Speaking on the podcast, Casey said: ""Me, Tom and Will, you saw it on the TV I was constantly with those boys. We built up such a strong relationship in there. I just assumed we'd keep that strong relationship outside the villa but that really hasn't been the case. I know obviously me and Tom are still close, we live together now but I feel like Will has distanced himself from us,"" he continued.

""That's not to say he doesn't like us it's just that he's so busy with Jessie. I completely understand, he's a busy boy but it would be nice to meet up with him and speak some more to him.""

It comes after Will unfollowed four of his fellow Islanders""” Tom Clare, Casey O'Gorman, Ron Hall, and Kai Fagan ""”on Instagram and said he wanted to focus on his relationship with Jessie. ""I was pretty close with Tom and Casey in the villa, you know, the three musketeers! But kind of outside me and Jessie are just focusing on ourselves,"" Will said on The Useless Hotline Podcast.

Jessie added: ""We've been out on the farm, it's really hard, they're all like ""˜come to Manchester' and it's like babe we're so far away! It would take us a day to get there.""

Jeremy Clarkson closed his farm shop on his Cotswolds farm amid controversy last year, but has since reopened in time for the second series of Clarkson's Farm on Amazon

Jeremy Clarkson's Diddly Squat Farm Shop reopened today for the first time since the outspoken TV presenter made comments about Meghan Markle that sparked a global backlash.

Clarkson, 62, shut his store after the controversy but reopened again today to mark the launch of the second series of his Amazon show.

As the second series of his farming adventures airs on Amazon this month, Clarkson reopened his farm shop but was seen to only welcome a handful of visitors. Just 14 customers were seen visiting the shop, which is a far cry from the massive crowds and queues of cars which flooded the farm last year.

Whilst visitor numbers were visibly down compared to previous years, the store has raised its prices and is now hundreds of per cent higher than high street supermarkets like Aldi.

Prices have increased as a large loaf of sourdough bread now costs £6 and a box of eggs costs £3.20, whereas milk from Clarkson's 'cow juice' milk dispenser now costs £1.20.

A pork pie now costs £3.50 in Clarkson's farm shop, compared to current Aldi prices which see the savoury snack costing just £1.99.

The price hike comes after Clarkson called on the government to increase the prices of food as he believes its currently ""far too cheap"".

The former Top gear presenter made his scathing comments in a a discussion about the farming industry, ahead of Clarkson's Farm returning for its new series on Amazon Prime.

Speaking out about difficulties facing the farming industry, Jeremy said that one issue for cereal farms like his own is the increased cost of fertiliser. He said: ""Fertiliser is now costing £1,000 a tonne rather than £200 like last year.""

He added that farmers in various areas are experiencing a ""nightmare,"" before indicating that he's in a more fortunate position as he has other ways of earning an income.

Jeremy said: ""It's not a disaster for me because I've got other ways of earning a living but if you haven't - and 99.9 per cent of farmers don't have another income stream - then a lot of them are simply not taking a wage.""

He then added that he believes the Government should reconsider the price of food, as it's currently ""too cheap"": ""Food is far too cheap. I know you can't say that, but it's far too cheap.""

He added: ""If the Government said, 'Right, we're going to double the price of food,' they'd be out of office within five minutes. But that's what they've got to do, really.""

A teenage farmer has died in a horror car crash as friend pay tribute to a 'lovely lad' who 'could make anyone smile

Alan Cameron, 19, from Inveraray, was the driver of a black Renault Clio which crashed between Ardgenavan and Clachan at roughly 9pm on April 30.

Emergency services were called to the collision but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

Alan was a well-known Highland Cow handler at Cladich Fold, in Dalmally, and took award-winning bulls for show at the Royal Highland Show.

Tributes have poured in for the teenager who was described as a 'lovely lad' who 'could make anyone smile', Daily Record reports.

Donald Kennedy wrote: ""Still can't believe this. He had the best nature and a hell of a character that could make anyone smile. He was so good to our boy and had infinite patience.

""They don't make people like that anymore. Loved that boy the day I met him, a grafter, good laugh and so so caring.

""Will always remember you, Alan Cameron. You made a massive impression in my family's life and I'll never forget you, ever.""

Love Island contestant Will Young, a 23-year-old farmer, spoke 'at length' with the show's psychological support team after his partner Jessie Wynter, 26, found out he'd kissed another woman in Casa Amor

Devastated farmer Will Young broke down in tears with Love Island staff ­after his cheating came to light.

The 23-year-old had to be taken aside and calmed down after his Australian partner Jessie Wynter found out he had kissed Casa Amor bombshell Layla Al-Momani, 28.

His breakdown came after a tense recoupling shown on Thursday night's show.

Emotional Jessie, 26, appeared heartbroken when she discovered Will had not been faithful - and Will's emotions spilled over.

A source said: ""After the cameras stopped rolling Will was spoken to at length by members of the psychological support team.

""There were concerns for his future on the show. He was very upset.""

Will, who documents his life on a farm on social media, chose to remain with Jessie.

But he admitted that seeing the personal trainer walk in with another man or having to explain what he did with Layla would leave him broken.

He said: ""I have let myself down, and I hope I haven't let Jessie down, to be quite honest.' And he then confirmed that he was ­""staying loyal"" to Jessie - who struggled to accept his apology.

She told the other girls she had planned to come back to the villa from Casa Amor and tell him she loved him.

The couple remained the bookies' favourites to win last night, despite their wobble.

A spokesman for the show said: ""We have dedicated welfare producers and psychological support on hand at all times. They monitor and regularly speak to all of the Islanders in private and off camera.

""Islanders are always able to reach out and talk to someone if they feel the need. We will continue to monitor all of our Islanders in line with our robust protocols.""

There have been wild claims that on October 22 Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin died and was secretly replaced by a body double being controlled by Russian security henchmen and senior apparatchiks

Vladimir Putin's alleged secret gymnast partner has not been seen in public since rumours emerged of the Kremlin leader's death.

Some Russian sources have claimed that Putin has actually died and been replaced by a body double controlled by senior Russian officials. They claim that he is now a mouthpiece of security henchmen and senior apparatchiks but such claims are seen by almost all analysts as a wild conspiracy theory.

But supporters claim that Olympic champion Alina Kabaeva, a woman who is claimed to be the mother of two or three of Putin's children, and his secret lover, also hasn't been seen since late October. This is said to be around the date Putin supposedly suffered a heart attack and she has not re-emerged since.

Earlier in October she was highly visible in footage from her Alina Kabaeva Sky Grace Rhythmic Gymnastics Academy in Sochi - an elite training base for future sports stars. But she was last seen on October 22, at the Games of Countries tournament held at her academy. She was wearing a white jacket and cut a cake to mark the end of the competition.

She was accompanied by her mentor Irina Viner, Russia 's top rhythmic gymnastics coach and ex-wife of pro-Kremlin oligarch Alisher Usmanov. Kabaeva is not believed to have been seen since, although she has previously had long absences from public view. This was the same day that Telegram channel General SVR claimed Putin had suffered cardiac arrest.

Two days after Putin's alleged death a message is posted in her name marking All-Russian Gymnastics Day with a eulogy to coaches - but she is not seen in any video or contemporaneous picture. A rhythmic gymnastics tournament was advertised in Uzbekistan from 9-13 November, but Kabaeva was seemingly not in attendance.

The same Telegram channel, which has made a number of astounding claims around Putin and the powerful in Russia, said the secretary of the security council Nikolai Patrushev, 72, was now in charge. The elite are allegedly discussing whether to run the doppelgÃ¤nger in next year's presidential election, it is claimed. The double is being coached in what to say, and how to behave, at meetings where he poses as Putin.

Patrushev wants to see a long term replacement put in place, possibly his son, Dmitry, 46, currently agriculture minister. Patrushev ""is trying to convince the elites who have rallied around him that a successor is needed and as soon as possible,"" said the channel. It added: ""So far, not everyone shares Patrushev's pessimism regarding the prospects for using a double. But, be that as it may, a decision must be made soon.""

Kabaeva is seen as having been Putin's girlfriend since 2008 - when he was still married to former Russian first lady Lyudmila Putina - three years after he gave her a major award at the Kremlin. Some accounts suggest they were secretly married, and she has often been seen wearing a wedding ring. The Kremlin has always denied a relationship. She is known to have given birth in Switzerland in 2015, and in Moscow in 2019.

Until the start of the war, she regularly used a Swiss mansion overlooking Lake Geneva. Dictator Putin has insisted: ""I have a private life in which I do not permit interference. It must be respected.""

He deplored ""those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others' lives"". Kabaeva is on record as saying she had met an unnamed man who ""I love very much"", gushing: ""Sometimes you feel so happy that you even feel scared.""

The former England cricket star has reportedly agreed a £9 million compensation package with the BBC over the loss of two year's earnings as a result of his injures

Freddie Flintoff is reportedly set to receive a staggering £9 million in compensation from the BBC following his horrific car crash whilst filming scenes for Top Gear.

The horror smash last December left the former England cricket star with serious facial injuries and broken ribs, putting him out action for several months. Now it is claimed the 45-year-old could be about to use a large proportion of his payout to boost development proposals of a company he co-owns.

Flintoff is a director of Logik Developments, who reportedly plan to turn three plots of Lancashire agricultural land into industrial and retail units, and a hotel. However, those plans have been met with 487 objections by angry villagers in picturesque Samlesbury.

One farmhouse resident, whose stunning views would be transformed into that of a lorry-filled park, described the proposal as a ""monstrosity"" that would be ""visible everywhere"" in the village, according to MailOnline. He added: ""Ask Mr Flintoff if he'd like it built in his back garden.""

Flintoff could be about to make a dramatic TV comeback, meanwhile, after news emerged that he is keen to revive BBC2's Chasing Cars - a renovation show described as a merge between The Repair Shop and Top Gear. A TV insider told The Sun: ""Freddie is a hugely popular TV star and any channel or streamer would be thrilled to sign up one of his shows.

""His return to the limelight is something both telly execs and the public have been longing for and thankfully he now seems ready to return to doing what he loves. He just needs to get past the one year anniversary of the crash, then he can focus on the next chapter of his career.""

But that aside, it seems that the cricket legend is also in talks about various other projects for 2024. And he is reportedly working with a production company he's worked with before, called South Shore. At the time of his worrying crash, Freddie was airlifted to hospital after a three-wheeler Morgan Super 3 flipped over at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey.

In a statement regarding the accident, BBC Studios said: ""BBC Studios has reached an agreement with Freddie that we believe supports his continued rehabilitation, return to work and future plans. We have sincerely apologised to Freddie and will continue to support him with his recovery.""

And following a review into the health and safety of the show, the results of which will reportedly not be published, the BBC has been accused of failing to protect Freddie. Now, Top Gear is reportedly set to be axed after 46 years. BBC bosses are thought to have made the ""tough decision"" following the crash which almost killed presenter Flintoff, according to reports.

Military analysts disputed the Russian defence ministry's footage, saying it appeared to show them blasting farm vehicles with a missile from a Ka-52 Alligator attack helicopter

Kremlin defence chiefs have been mocked for claiming to destroy a Leopard 2 tank - when in fact they hit a combine harvester in Ukrainian fields.

The ministry's propaganda team told Russian media that footage shows ""the destruction of foreign armoured vehicles, including Leopard tanks"".

But the claim of destroying the German-supplied tanks quickly backfired, as military analysts disputed the footage, saying it appeared to show Russia blasting farm vehicles with a missile from a Ka-52 Alligator attack helicopter.

In the video, the Russian crew asks: ""What kind of machine is that?"" before a voice replies: ""Let's hit it.""

They later celebrate the strike, saying: ""Yeah, direct hit.""

The footage was ridiculed by head of Wagner private army Yevgeny Prigozhin, who sees it as yet more evidence of blundering by Putin's defence chiefs and army.

""ŒHe said in a sarcastic tone: ""The Russian Ministry of Defence has today posted some impressive work by [its troops].

""Œ""The footage clearly shows Leopard tanks moving in a strange tactical manoeuvre towards each other. These tanks are disguised as combine harvesters.

""Œ""Their muzzles are bent downwards. This did not prevent our [troops] from discerning enemy equipment in them.

""Œ""These [Ukrainian] b******s have learned to disguise their tanks as harvesters, and their crew as farmers.

""Œ""Thanks {Russian troops] for your fine work. Now we will destroy anything with a bent muzzle.""

""ŒThe suspected targets were John Deere 9000 grain harvesters and a John Deere 4830 sprayer-like tractor.

Military informer Telegram channel said: ""We do not want to state anything, but the vehicles in the footage published by the Russian Ministry of Defence do not resemble any tanks at all in their silhouette.""

""ŒThe silhouettes ""most closely resemble combine harvesters"", it said.

""This is evidenced by the characteristic high mounted discharge augers (pipes), which are clearly not guns due to their location.

""Œ""Also the ""˜tanks' do not show any signs of turrets.""

I""Œt added: ""We do not know why it was necessary to present footage of a mistaken defeat of agricultural equipment as an actual video of the defeat of the Leopards.""

The footage came as Lt-Gen Igor Konashenkov - the ministry's spokesman - boasted about vast Ukrainian losses while providing no convincing evidence.

Total losses in recent fighting amounted to ""over 1,500 Ukrainian servicemen, 28 tanks, including FRG-manufactured eight Leopard tanks, three French-manufactured AMX-10 wheeled tanks and 109 armoured fighting vehicles"".

""ŒSeparately, Prigozhin demanded 200,000 soldiers to be put under his control to correct the mess left by Russian forces.

""ŒHe has warned that Ukraine had already broken through Russian lines, and that Russia is losing the war due to incompetence in the army high command.

""Œ""The Wagner PMC [private military company] is today the only full-fledged army structure - with planes, helicopters, tanks, artillery and everything else that is needed,"" he said.

""Œ""I need 200,000 people. Less than 200,000 on the front line Lugansk-Donetsk will not cope.

""Œ""We are ready to take full responsibility.""

Dana McGregor teaches people to surf in California's Pismo Beach with the help of goats Pismo and younger sister Grover, who are adapt at riding bag waves and extreme barrels

A new extreme experience lets you combine a love of agricultural matters and a passion for ripping down barrels.

Dana McGregor is the brain behind Surfing Goats, a one-and-a-half to two hour experience which is exactly what it sounds like.

The California native first fell in love with the four-legged caprine animals when he got Goatee, an older goat who helped him clear poisoned oak in his back yard.

They quickly became so inspeperable that Dana invited the hooved pal down to the beach to join him for a surfing session.

Along with human friend Ryan Valliere, he decided to put the goat on a board.

""She had really good balance,"" Valliere told the Los Angeles Daily News. ""We were like, 'Let's push her into waves.'""

Goatee was such a dab hand at balancing on the boards that Dana tried out other goats, and realised they also had the knack.

Surfing Goats was born.

Now Dana teaches people to surf in California's Pismo Beach by using Goatee's kids, Pismo and younger sister Grover.

Sadly Goatee cannot help new recruits as she died several years ago, so now Pismo is the star of the show.

""I just knew it was time for him to get in the water,"" Dana said of his now number one goat surfer in a Youtube video.

""After seeing him surfing a couple of times, I just knew he was a natural. It was obvious ""” I was like, this guy wants to be a big wave surfer.""

The Surf Goat Day package includes a surf lesson, board rental, tandem surf ride, and spin on the Rapture Party Wave Board, and is open to all ages and experience levels.

For those who prefer to stay on land, there's a one-and-a-half-hour Surf Goat Hike in Pismo Preserve in which guests walk with Pismo, play a game called GoatBall and get to drink a glass of goat milk.

Dana has since expanded his goat empire by writing two children's books.

The Surfing Goat, Goatee is a ""fun, true story of a man's plan to get a goat to eat the weeds in his mom's yard, and to then eat the goat himself, takes a turn for the better for the man and for the goat!

""Their experiences through life together are out of this world. Many are saying this is one of the greatest surfing goat books of our generation!""

The follow up, Pismo's Party Wave, follows a similar theme.

""A story of friendship told by The Goat Father about Pismo, The Surfing Goat, who has a dream to bring all of creation together, for such a time as this!"" the blurb explains.

""Let them take you on the wave that changed the world. Many are saying THIS is one of the greatest surfing goat books of our generation!""

Pismo Beach lies about 150miles to the north of Los Angeles, which can be flown to from a number of different UK airports.

An adorable kitten in Omaha, Nebraska sparked fears over the spread of rabies. The kitten 'Stanely' bit and scratched at least 10 people who had to be tested by experts

A stray kitten caused alarm after it was discovered with a strange and new form of rabies, leading to concern over the possible spread of the disease.

The cat called 'Stanley' was taken in by the Wahl family after a friend found him, but what should have been a happy new addition soon turned into a nightmare when the kitty began developing seizures and stopped eating. Stanley had a form of rabies more commonly found in racoons in the Appalachians, around 1,000 miles east of Nebraska.

The rabies signs were there, Stanley had one pupil larger than the other, but Madeline and Rich Wahl thought their new pet had a bad reaction to ringworm medication. An initial assessment by a vet put the symptoms down to other possible causes, but did raise some possibility of rabies.

Vet Sharon Mix said: ""We haven't had rabies in forever."" Stanley died a day after he visited the vets in in Omaha, Nebraska

He bit and scratched up to 10 people and testing is now underway to determine if any of them were affected. If it is not contained then the disease has the potential to infect up to 7 million people in the US, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC)

""It's just something that can snowball very quickly,"" said County Health Director Lindsay Huse. ""The goal is to prevent this raccoon variant of rabies from establishing itself here in our area. This would cause a substantial impact if it happened and put many people in danger.""

Richard Chipman, the US Department of Agriculture's coordinator of the national rabies programme, said according to the Mail: ""We've never had a nine-alarm fire like this.""

Officials acted quickly to vaccinate animals in the area. In total, 753 raccoons, 41 skunks, four wild cats and a red fox were vaccinated. Another 18,000 vaccine packets were placed in a five-mile radius and work by enticing the animals to chew, coating their mouth and tonsils with the virus.

Head of the rabies epidemiology at the CDC, Ryan Wallace said: ""If we can test [a total] of 500 animals over the next few months through this surveillance program and all are negative, then there is likely no spread in local wildlife. We won't know for sure until around February.""

Brean, on the Somerset coastline, boasts a long stretch of sand and is popular with walkers. While in town, visitors can also learn its history, which dates back to 10,000 BC

A little-known idyllic town located just one hour from Bristol is home to one of Europe's longest stretches of sand and is considered a hidden gem as not many tourists visit it.

Brean, in the West Country, boasts seven miles of golden sand and during low tide, mud flats are exposed. The beach, on the Somerset coastline, is popular with people who enjoy walking outdoors, as well as dog walkers and water sports enthusiasts.

Offering breathtaking views of the Bristol Channel, the beach is also home to a 4th-century Roman temple. Visitors can also explore a 19th-century fort that was originally built to fend off a possible Napoleonic invasion.

Early signs of life in the area date back to 10,000 BC and there is archaeological evidence of extinct animals such as mammoths and woolly rhinos existing in the area, according to Discover Brean. Brean Down Fort was built in the 1860s as one of the Palmerston Forts to protect the ports of the Bristol Channel.

While no shots were ever fired in action, in 1900 there was an explosion caused by a soldier firing into a magazine containing three tonnes of gunpowder, consequently losing his life. The explosion caused considerable damage and the fort was eventually decommissioned in 1901. During the Second World War, the fort was then re-armed as a coastal artillery battery.

Apart from its fascinating history, those wishing to visit Brean can also admire its strong links with agriculture, thanks to ""Celtic"" fields on the Down. There are also two churches tourists can visit - St Bridget's Church from the 13th century and Brean Methodist Church, which was first established in the late 1700s.

Earlier this month, the beachfront Warren Farm Holiday Centre was named Holiday Centre of the Year at the AA Caravan and Camping Awards, BristolLive reports. The family-run site has luxury caravans - with hot tubs - for hire and spacious touring pitches, some with private bathrooms.

The first section of the King Charles III England Coastal Path at Brean Down was recently opened and this is expected to attract even more day-trippers. It is also one of the few places in the West Country where you are allowed to park on the beach, making access easy.

Thanks to its location, Brean is also an ideal base for exploring the West Country. The town is situated between Weston-super-Mare and Burnham-on-Sea.

TripAdvisor is full of raving reviews of the spot. One happy tourist wrote: ""I was staying in Burnham on Sea for 2 nights, a delightful town, I thought although didn't have much time to explore. The beach was beautiful, sand for miles and a great little lighthouse. I went to Brean Down on a blustery day, threatening showers and misty but so glad I did.

""It is an overwhelming experience and I will definitely visit again on a sunnier day. There were quite a lot of steps to encounter but getting up there is worth it and walk right along to the end. I loved Brean Down, so called ""natural pier"". The views were wonderful even on not such a clear day.""

Another said: ""It really doesn't disappoint. The walk out on the peninsula to the fort is fantastic, you get great views of Weston-super-Mare and across the Bristol channel, Cardiff. The fort is interesting, although we were disappointed one of the main blocks is inaccessible, and you can take a different route back to the steps leading to the car park.""

A third added: ""Good walk around the hills lots of war history to see very steep at the beginning we went the wrong way round really take the steps first hard at the beginning but better after that.""

Actress Lesley Manville couldn't believe that she had family in Australia after a relative was transported to the country in the 1800s where he faced execution

Lesley Manville is astonished to learn she has family in Australia after her convict ancestor was transported in 1831.

The actress, who plays Princess Margaret in The Crown, is told her great x3 grandfather Aaron Harding, a farm labourer, narrowly avoided execution for leading a mob in the Swing Riots.

The widower with nine children put up with years of poor pay and conditions before the great uprising of workers protesting at their livelihoods being threatened by machinery.

Bafta winner Lesley, 67, tells Who Do You Think You Are? experts: ""I'm bursting with pride. He was this poor man not being properly paid. He sounds like such a fantastic character.""

The swing riots were one of the biggest uprisings that Britain had ever seen, with agricultural labourers - who'd long suffered tough conditions and low pay - protesting about the increasing mechanisation of farming.

Mobs attacked threshing machines and symbols of oppression such as workhouses, ripping off roofs and pulling down doors and ceilings.

Because the authorities feared a full-blown revolution, the sentences for those arrested and convicted were harsh.

Nearly 2,000 protesters were brought to trial in 1830-1831; 252 were sentenced to death (though only 19 were actually hanged), 644 were imprisoned and 481 were transported to Australia. The country was first set up as a penal colony in the 1780s and by the 1830s was fully established.

Aaron faced the death penalty after his mob of hundreds attacked and partially demolished the workhouse in Selborne, Hants, before moving on to nearby Headley.

Lesley learns that rather than being executed, he was sentenced to ""transportation for life"" to New South Wales.

She says: ""He would have been without anyone that he knew. No love, no family.""

Aaron was pardoned in 1837, but on the condition that he did not leave Australia. A decade later, he settled down with Alice, who bore him two sons, leading to a whole line of Australian relatives that Lesley knew nothing of.

She is thrilled to meet Rebecca and Claire Watts, also great x3 granddaughters of Aaron, who have a photo of him.

She says: ""Aaron had descendants! It's bizarre to think I've got family here. It's extraordinary.""

Erik ten Hag brought home Manchester United's first piece of silverware in six years last weekend but his time at Old Trafford hasn't been plain sailing as two close confidants detail

Erik ten Hag is driven by a desire to prove the haters wrong.

According to two of the friends who know him best, the Manchester United manager's laid-back demeanour disguises a burning ambition to prove he was born to win. Clemens Zwijnenberg, once a right-back at Bristol City, has known Ten Hag since they came through the youth system together at FC Twente almost 40 years ago.

He still has holiday photographs from back in the day, one showing Ten Hag with a full head of dark hair wearing budgie-smuggler swimming trunks. Former Brighton midfielder Hans Kraay is another close confidante. He played alongside the 51-year-old at De Graafschap and is now a highly-respected broadcaster in his homeland.

Now the pair have lifted the lid on how the mate who guided United to their first trophy in six years by winning the Carabao Cup last weekend, was ridiculed mercilessly about the agricultural accent that reveals his rural upbringing.

They recall how Ten Hag resisted Louis van Gaal's advice to turn United down because they were a club that was unfit for purpose. And they reveal how the Dutchman went into Old Trafford knowing that there was a huge problem brewing with fallen superstar Cristiano Ronaldo.

Kraay, who played alongside Ten Hag at De Graafschap, said: ""Erik deserves this success at United. People do not realise that he had to walk through minefields at United in his first five months.

""It was chaos at the club for a start - and there were the mines laid by Cristiano Ronaldo. Erik went to United because he saw the potential and the challenge. You know what Van Gaal said to Ten Hag, don't you? ""˜Erik, it is one big mess at United, don't go there'.

""But Erik did, he did not mind sorting it all out and didn't mind walking around Cristiano's landmines. What is great about Erik is that he is down to earth and never wants to be a flash manager like some managers. He is not like Jose Mourinho. When he went into his first day of training, he wanted to go in a van with his own cones in the back. That sums him up.""

Kraay added: ""Erik has always had to fight and work hard for everything he has achieved. Before he won his first league titles at Ajax he was ridiculed for his strong countryside accent. They used to imitate him in satire shows on TV.

""In Holland, everyone said a coach with such an accent could not work at a big flash club like Ajax. When Ajax started to win trophies everyone said that was all the work of technical director Marc Overmars.

""Only when he started to beat European giants like Real Madrid and Juventus did he finally get the credit. This is why I say, ""˜don't laugh at Ten Hag and never underestimate him.' Erik will always rise above all the expectations.""

Zwijnenberg became Ten Hag's best friend when they became team-mates at the age of 13. He will never forget some of the criticism his pal faced - but revealed how Ten Hag prefers to let his achievements do his talking.

Zwijnenberg said: ""I used to explode in front of the telly because of all the things that were said about Erik. So many people have been prejudiced about him. Even before he went to United, some of the comments were absolutely scandalous.

""But the great thing about Erik is that he never shows any emotion towards his haters. I do think that deep inside it pushes him to prove everyone wrong. He has shut them all up in the past - and he is doing the same now.""

Zwijnenberg added: ""Erik went to United absolutely convinced he was going to bring trophies to Old Trafford. I know him, I know what he had in mind, and I also know what he has in mind for the next few years at the club.

""I did not get emotional when he lifted the Carabao Cup at Wembley. I did not even ring him or send him a text. I left him alone for three days because I knew the whole world wanted him and he had all kinds of important people around him. Me and him prefer to talk when he has a bit of breathing space.""

Both Zwijnenberg and Kraay admit that Ten Hag's decision to join his players on an eight-and-a-half-mile punishment run after the 4-0 defeat at Brentford in August showed the United squad that their manager can also walk the walk.

Zwijnenberg said: ""I told Erik he was crackers, that he didn't have to do that and that he should not have done that. But Erik's loyalty is absolutely massive.

""I have felt that loyalty as his friend - and I see that very same loyalty when he is managing a team, like he is doing now at Manchester United."" Kraay added: ""Erik probably didn't know whether he could actually run 13.8 kilometres. I know for a fact he could hardly walk for three weeks afterwards!""

The sheep, from two separate farms in Peru, were found without their eyes and brains, with two tiny holes in their heads with locals fearing when the beast will strike next

A mythical creature dubbed ""˜The Goat-Sucker' is feared to have killed 30 sheep.

All the woolly animals were missing their eyes and brains. They also all had tiny holes in their heads. The dead sheep were found on two separate farms.

The authorities are probing the mysterious deaths with it originally thought a puma was behind them. But now there is a concern a Goat-Sucker - real name Chupacabra - could be behind them.

They get their moniker because legend suggests they drink the blood of their victims. The sheep were killed in Ocobamba, Peru.

Farmers Emelia Ruiz Santos and Segundina Quispe de Palomino reported the odd deaths to the National Agricultural Health Service. Emelia found 16 of her animals dead and Segundina discovered 14 had been killed.

District mayor Henry VÃ­lchez Arango said: ""This has shocked the entire population."" There have been numerous alleged sightings of Chupacabra in the Americas since the 1970s, including as far north as Maine in the US and as far south as Chile.

However, all reported sightings have been disregarded as anecdotal and lacking evidence. In June a Chupacabra is believed to have feasted on chickens, ducks, and turkeys in TecpÃ¡n, Guatemala.

The same month, one is feared to have devoured several cows, llamas, and alpacas near the Bolivian city of Oruro. In May, a Chupacabra was allegedly responsible for the death of a ram in Mexico.

Meanwhile in another part of Peru, villagers are under attack from 'face-eating aliens'. Reports of 'Los Pelacaras' or 'The Face Peelers' - said to be seven-foot tall - have been emerging from the small community of Loreto since July, according to La Republica. There is so much fear around the beasts that the Peruvian National Police and army have been called in to investigate.

""I have found him face to face, he hides his face. I've seen the whole body floating. He moves his arms, everything is normal,"" said one eyewitness. The witnesses, members of the Ikitu tribe, have been reporting these sightings since July 11.

In one terrifying encounter, a 15-year-old girl narrowly escaped with her life after allegedly being set upon by the 'alien'. ""As a result of the struggle, they cut part of her neck,"" reported local community leader Jairo ReÃ¡tegui DÃ¡vila.

Locals are so terrified they can't sleep and have set up their own community patrols in a bid to prevent an attack. Horrifying images show community members with bandaged heads. But now investigations may prove fruitless as the village is so remote it takes 10 hours to get there by riverboat.

""We need support for our community. The children do not sleep and the mothers stay up all night. They appear to be armored. I shot one of them twice and he wasn't injured, he rose and disappeared,"" DÃ¡vila said.

A British businessman and former honorary consul who has been kidnapped in Ecuador owns an estate in the Yorkshire Dales and the Forbidden Corner visitor attraction

A kidnapped British diplomat in Ecuador is well known for his business ties in Yorkshire that includes a pleasure ground.

Colin Armstrong, a former British honorary consul in Guayaquil, was abducted in the early hours of Saturday from a farm he owned, Ecuadorian police confirmed. A video said to show signs of forced entry, along with traces of blood and ransacked rooms, is understood to be circulating on social media.

The ongoing investigation to locate Mr Armstrong is being handled by Ecuador National Police director Cesar Augusto Zapata along with a specialist anti-kidnap and extortion unit. In a tweet the force said: ""Following an apparent criminal act against a businessman in the early hours of this morning in Los Rios, specialist police units are carrying out operative and investigative work on the ground.""

British intelligence services are also said to be assisting the Ecuadorian-led investigation into the whereabouts of the missing expat. Police in Ecuador are believed to have switched their focus to Katherine Paola Santos, Mr Armstrong's partner who is reportedly being quizzed by the authorities after being rescued.

As well as founding and owning a large agricultural supply company in the South American country, he is a director along with his son of the 500-acre Tupgill Park Estate near Leyburn in North Yorkshire which has been the family home for more than 45 years. His grandfather Robert, who was a jockey and horse trainer bought the estate in 1904 and his father Gerald was also a jockey.

The Forbidden Corner, the self-styled 'Strangest Place in the World', in Tupgill Park, is a four-acre labyrinth of paths and tunnels leading to surreal follies and bizarre sculptures, YorkshireLive reports. It was built in the 1980s by the owner of Tupgill Park, Colin Armstrong, with architect Malcolm Tempest, as a private pleasure garden.

The park was, by popular demand, opened to the public in 1997. Forbidden Corner had failed to obtain permission from the Dales national park authority to open the garden to the public.

The park applied for retrospective permission in 2000 which was rejected by the park authority on the grounds that too many people were visiting by car and the gardens were not in keeping with the Dales national park. The authority ordered the park to close to the public and for the follies to be removed.

This was overturned on appeal following a petition with 10,000 signatures on condition the number of visitors per hour was reduced to 120.

On its website it states: ""Thanks to everyone who has visited us and helped to keep our gardens open, you can come and enjoy the unique labyrinth of Tunnels, Chambers, Follies and surprises created in a four acre garden in the heart of the Yorkshire Dales. See you soon.""

A spokeswoman for the folly garden created by Mr Armstrong said they were aware of the reports of the kidnapping in Ecuador. ""The thoughts and prayers of everyone at Forbidden Corner are with the Armstrong family,"" she told the BBC.

Ecuador's National Police have so far made only one official comment on the kidnap, which happened around 2.45am local time on Saturday at the British businessman's ranch called Rancho Rodeo Grande. The ranch is located near the town of Baba in Los Rios province, two hours drive north of Guayaquil.

Monster Hunter Wilds is the debut title of Monster Hunter generation 6, coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and Steam in 2025

Monster Hunter Wilds is the official name for what fans have previously referred to as Monster Hunter 6, with the next entry in Capcom's series launching in 2025.

Monster Hunter fans have been waiting on a new game for a while now. Rumours about Monster Hunter 6 started cropping up back in July, however, Capcom's TGS presentation passed by with the only mention of Monster Hunter being an announcement of a 20th-anniversary celebration. The rumours ended up being about Dragon's Dogma 2, but we knew we'd have to hear about a new Monster Hunter soon. The Game Awards hit us with a massive reveal as the last world premiere of the show, announcing Monster Hunter Wilds - the 6th generation of Monster Hunter - which is arriving on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

I've watched the trailer multiple times now to find out some details that players may have missed (plus it looks phenomenal which helps). Here's what I've found out about Monster Hunter Wilds from the debut trailer.

Two weapons at once

A big portion of the new Monster Hunter Wilds Trailer was focused on the new wyvern mount. We watched as a hunter equipped with a Greatsword rode on the back of this mount, however, the real news was what this mount was carrying.

If you take a look at the big orange holster attached to the wyvern mount, you can spot what looks like a Light Bowgun. If I had to guess, it looks like you can now take two weapons out on the hunt in Monster Hunter Wilds.

Simultaneous PC release

I don't imagine many of you missed the big Steam logo at the end of the trailer, and whatever, Monster Hunter World and Rise came out on PC right?

The real news here is that Monster Hunter Wilds is set to be the first game in the series to launch simultaneously on consoles and PC. World came to PC seven months after PS4 and Xbox One got it, and Rise took 10 months to make the jump from Nintendo Switch to PC. Capcom are finally letting PC players join the hunt on launch day.

New monsters and density

What would a Monster Hunter game be without monsters? We actually didn't see too many new monsters. We saw a lot of monsters, but not new designs.

The trailer shows the hunter being chased by a pack of large monsters that look like a new variant of the Goss Harag - which was an ice creature introduced in Monster Hunter Rise. The hunter then navigated through a pack of armadillo-like and Barroth-like herbivores. Plus some tiny raptor-looking things are scurrying around too. You can also see a new flying monster in the background of some shots.

However, what's most impressive is the sheer number of monsters on-screen at once. It's miles ahead of anything we've seen in previous entries. The game seems to be harnessing the full power of the RE Engine and the current-gen systems. Oh, and of course the Rathalos has to make an appearance just at the end too. You cant ignore the flagship monster.

New setting and dynamic weather

The Monster Hunter Wilds trailer also gave us our first look at the new setting for the game. We mainly see desert locales throughout the trailer, with the hunter's attire seeming like a good fit for the lands. However, the most interesting thing we can see about this new arena so far is the strange weather phenomena.

During the trailer, the hunter is faced with a sandstorm and a thunderstorm, while the trailer ends with sand coursing over the land and turning it from a dusty desert into a lush grassland.

New mobility features

One of the biggest changes between Monster Hunter games tends to be the mobility. Monster Hunter 3 had underwater sections, 4 gave the series a new sense of verticality, and Monster Hunter Rise introduced mounts and the Wirebug grappling hooks.

Water and land have been covered, so now it looks like Monster Hunter is taking to the skies, as the new mount can fly through the air. Considering this, we'd expect a whole lot of flying wyverns to make an appearance in the Monster Hunter Wilds monster roster.

Protesters from Just Stop Oil have locked themselves to the set of Les MisÃ©rables at the Sondheim Theatre, Westminster, which has evacuated theatre goers from the building

Protesters from Just Stop Oil have stormed the stage of a West End show, as they unfurled banners and flags in front of shocked theatre goers.

The quartet interrupted the performance of One Day More of Les MisÃ©rables at the Sondheim Theatre in Westminster, carrying orange banners which read Just Stop Oil and The Show Can't Go On. They emerged during the song's crescendo, amongst actors bearing revolutionary red flags. The theatre was evacuated around twenty minutes after the group locked themselves to the set with bicycle locks.

Among the protesters is 23-year-old community worker Hannah Taylor, who said: ""The show starts with Jean Valjean stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's starving child. How long before we are all forced to steal loaves of bread?

""How long before there are riots on the streets? The show cannot go on. We are facing catastrophe. New oil and gas means crop failure, starvation and death. It is an act of war on the global south and an utter betrayal of young people.

""Rishi Sunak has just approved Rosebank, a new oil project in the north sea which will produce as much carbon as the annual emissions of the 28 lowest-income countries combined. It will lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths due to starvation as crops fail in the increasingly extreme weather conditions.""

""Am I not, like Jean Valjean, justified in breaking the law to oppose this criminal government and its murderous policies? Ask yourself, will you, like the citizens of Paris in the play, stand by and watch, or will you stand up against our governments' criminal plans and call for an end to new oil and gas?""

Several people on social media took against the group's actions and said they felt for those who had paid to watch the performance of the 19th century France-set show. Tickets for the production at Sondheim theatre start at £20 and rise to more than £100.

One person said on X, formerly known as Twitter: ""I'd be ripping their hands off the stage for the price of Les Mis tickets in the West End."" Another added: ""Imagine saving for months, making an overnight trip to London specifically to see Les Mis, a masterpiece that is a bucket list show for many people, only to have it ruined by protesters.""

Another of the protesters was Poppy Bliss, 19, a student from Nottingham, who said: ""I am taking action with Just Stop Oil because I am absolutely terrified for my future. I don't want to be disrupting people's evenings out, but I have been left with no other choice. Our government is betraying the young and putting everyone's futures on the line for the sake of a few votes. I am doing this because I am desperate.""

""We are frighteningly close to losing everything we love. Everything we know will be destroyed by climate collapse. I cannot do nothing and just watch that happen. I want a liveable future for my generation and the generations to come. The show cannot go on.""

A spokesman for Met Police said: ""At about 21:00hrs on Wednesday, 4 October, police were called to a protest inside a theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue, WC1. Local officers were quickly on scene and five people have been arrested.""

Westminster Police added on Twitter: ""At about 21:00hrs on Wednesday, 4 October, police were called to a protest inside a theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue, WC1. Local officers were quickly on scene and five people have been arrested.""

The cost-effective solution, based on the strong sense of smell foxes are known to have, will help you deter any foxes from setting up home in your garden and won't cause them any harm

Foxes are now a common sighting in the UK and in recent years, have made themselves residents in every city.

Whilst it can be a nice surprise to spot one in your garden from time to time, foxes can become a nuisance for the green-fingered among us. Thankfully, experts have shared a clever tip to help deter foxes safely to avoid any mess in your garden.

The cost-effective solution will help you keep the fox population in your yard minimal and won't cost you more than 14p. Experts have suggested the solution based on the strong sense of smell foxes are known to have.

Speaking to Express.co.uk, Sam Jenkinson, garden building expert at Tiger, said: ""Foxes are known to dislike the smell of chilli and garlic, so one way to keep them away is to create a natural fox repellent by infusing them in boiling water and spraying the solution around the garden. Foxes are also known to strongly dislike the scent of coffee or citrus fruits, so leaving leftover coffee grounds or citrus peel around the garden is another good trick.""

A pack of lemons at Aldi can set you back 55p which means the solution to keeping away foxes is 14p per lemon if you get the bag. You would probably have a few lemons left over for some cooking too.

Another way to deter foxes is to remove any potential food sources and this is the the most common reason foxes are lured into your garden. This can include any type of bin and you should most definitely avoid leaving bin bags out in the plastic bags unless you want them scattered all over the pavement by the morning.

The expert also said: ""Bird feeders must also be elevated at least five feet off the ground, and away from shrubs or trees so they are out of reach for foxes. If you grow your fruit and vegetables, make sure crops are well protected with fruit cages and promptly clear away any fallen fruit or seed spillages and if you have pets, feed them indoors and regularly clean up any mess left behind by them.""

Experts at the Paving Shoppers have that during mating season, it's important to be even more aware of foxes making a home around your property including underneath the porches and decks. These places can provide an ideal shelter for foxes who have babies. They said: ""Remember, the goal is to deter and not harm, maintaining a balance between protecting your property and respecting wildlife.""

Mirror Motoring's Gareth Butterfield has been living with the clever but costly Nextbase IQ dash cam for a few months

Nextbase IQ Smart dash cam

Dash cams come in all shapes and sizes, and there are budget options and premium options. But I've never tested anything quite like the Nextbase IQ Smart Dash Cam.

It's a brand that has become one of the favourite choices for dash cams, with a 76% market share in the UK, so it's no surprise to see such an innovative device cropping up as its hero product.

Let me talk you through what it can do. It's available as a three-camera setup, with a resolution of up to 4K and, using AI, it intelligently keeps tabs on the road around you, monitoring other cars, pedestrians pedestrians and cyclists.

It goes further than that too. Because of the unusual way it wires into your car, through the OBDII port, it's always on, subtly keeping watch on your vehicle when you're not with it. This means the dash cam extends its versatility to become a security device.

You can log in through the excellent Nextbase IQ app to pick up a live feed of the two built-in cameras, and proximity and G-force sensors will alert you if someone is snooping around while you're parked up.

It has a voice-activated panic system which will automatically save recordings if you feel under threat, and then send a message to an emergency contact. All this can be triggered without your input in the event of an accident.

There's even an alarm, which you can set off remotely if you're worried your vehicle may be under some sort of threat.

So it's so much more than a dash cam. It's a tracker, a car alarm, and a guardian angel.

But it goes even further than that. Because it connects to your car's ""brain"", you can make use of new features Nextbase is working on, such as a system to monitor and even control or limit the way your car is driven if you've let someone else get behind the wheel. It can even act as an infotainment system, responding to voice commands to play music, make phone calls, or control smart home devices.

It must sound amazing at this point, but there's a few important things to address. Firstly, it's quite big. The dual-camera unit that comes in the box as standard is based on a hinged speaker and camera frame, which sticks to your windscreen on a self-adhesive pad. It can be hidden fairly successfully, but it's still going to be quite obtrusive, even in big SUVs.

Another interesting quirk is in the way it's powered. It can be hard-wired using a supplied kit, but most people will connect it to their OBDII port. And that will mean it's permanently live. That's not great if you're nervous about battery levels, but the device will automatically power down if it thinks your battery is getting too low.

it does mean that fitting it is quite a commitment. Hiding the chunky wire is a fiddle, even with the supplied tool for stuffing it behind your trim. And once the self-adhesive pad is on, it's on. So be careful placing it. You do get a spare in the box, but it's something to take time getting right.

And then there's the cost. The IQ range starts at £299, which is big money for a dash cam. And that's just for the 1080P version. The 2K version costs another £50 and you'll be looking at £449 for the 4K version I've been testing.

It doesn't stop there, either, because there are subscription options to consider if you want to use the full feature set.

Essentially, regardless of the device you go for, a free package gives you access to the app, voice control and text notifications.

Paying £6.99 per month will open up things like image-based notifications, live view, the parking monitor, AI tools, the remote alarm and the guardian mode with a remote alarm. You also get 30 days of cloud storage.

Pay for the full package, at £9.99 per month, and you'll get 180 days of cloud storage, multiple user accounts, automated incident back-up, emergency SOS and an extended warranty.

If all this sounds quite expensive, that's because it is. But there's an important point still to consider. The Nextbase IQ is absolutely awesome.

Honestly, I've never known a dash cam like it. Some of the features it has I could take or leave, but as a security device, it's just remarkable.

Because the app is so good, it's a doddle to set up, and the regular firmware updates are simple to polish off - you'll need these to add the features Nextbase is working on.

The 4K version gives some of the best images I've seen on a dash cam, and that's no great surprise, but when you bundle it in with all the extras this device has, and its sheer versatility as a way to keep your vehicle secure starts to justify the initial cost, and the on-going cost. Let's not forget, a tracker can cost easily the same, if not more.

Britain's top-rated roast dinners for 2022 have been recorded in a special map. The best scores went to The Hawtorn in Howarth and Ducie Street Warehouse in Manchester, but there are plenty of other places to choose from

Earning the title of Britain's best roast dinner may be a much sought-after crown among food enthusiasts.

For many, it is the dish that reigns supreme in British cuisine and now people can hunt down the country's best roasts with a handy interactive map.

Blog Rate Good Roasts put together the online map, with good roasts cropping up from York to Liverpool and Bristol to Worthing.

Plenty of London restaurants have also been thrust into the mix.

Roast beef, vegetables and Yorkshire puddings are all part of the traditional gravy-topped mix that can frequently be found in pubs and dining tables across the land.

A top 10 list for 2022 was released featuring the likes of The Nags Head in Haughton, Cheshire and London's Blacklock in Soho.

The Hawthorn in Haworth, West Yorkshire, topped the list joint top with Ducie Street Warehouse in Manchester for 2022.

Some restaurants do them better than others, so here is a list of where you can get stuck into Britain's best roasts.

North West

Seekers of a succulent Sunday snack can wander on down to a number of pubs and restaurants in the North West including Manchester and Liverpool

With a historical rivalry more commonly associated with the green grass of the football pitch, the search for Britain's best roast dinner pitches the likes of Liverpool's Munro Pub against the Bull and Bear in Manchester.

Rate Good Roasts' records go back to 2018, but Manchester scored six top-ten hits for 2022, with the aforementioned Ducie Street Warehouse riding highest of all.

Beef sirloin at the restaurant will cost a punter £19.50, but a 'something for everyone' choice is also available at £27.50.

The coveted restaurant is followed by fellow city dwellers The Refuge, Kongs Kitchen, Pot Kettle Black, 10 Tib Lane and Ate Days A Week.

The Bank in Delph and Worsley's Coal and Cotton are also potential nearby choices making this year's list. In Cheshire, alternatives to The Nags Head include Casters in Alsager.

Yorkshire

Sadly, no pub in the North East has made the map so far, so punters may wish to travel a little further south in search of a top-of-the-range roast.

Yorkshire has plenty to choose from and 2022 joint winner The Hawthorn may be the first port of call.

Failing that Leeds has the 11th-placed Blackhouse, The Tetley Bar and Kitchen and Braizin Squad. On the country's east coast, some turning away from a traditional Whitby fish and chips may choose to frequent the White House Inn.

Midlands

Taking the prize of the Midlands' best roast dinner in 2022 is the Seats@Robinsons in Wolverhampton.

The restaurant said on its website: ""From a weekday brunch to a proper Sunday roast, we have a variety of dishes on offer. Prepared and cooked by our in-house chef, Tom, you can expect nothing but the finest.""

Alternatives include the Duck Goose in Leek, 6th place for 2022, to The Flintlock at Cheddleton, which scored an 85% approval rate in 2020.

London and the South

London has a long tradition of good pubs and restaurants and it is no surprise that a number of the capital's pubs and restaurants made the list.

Highest of all is the Old Queens Head in Islington, a Grade II list building claimed to be haunted by a Tudor ghost.

Blacklock in Soho is next up, followed by the Three Crowns in Stoke Newington.

Despite a strong showing in 2021 with The Cricketers in Cobham, Surrey and Bath's Alway Sunday Townhouse both featuring in the top 10, the best-placed Southern roast outside of London belonged to the Butchers Arms in the New Forest.

Scoring a 77% score, the Gloucestershire inn took 15th place.

The pubs and restaurants are listed as follows:

Residents around the Sussex coastline have been urged by environmental experts to be cautious, after a mysterious substance believed to be palm oil washed up on their shores

A mysterious substance washed up on a Sussex beach on Sunday, - sparking fears Brits' beloved dogs may be in danger if not properly monitored.

It is believed that palm oil was found on the Adur and Worthing coastline yesterday in three different locations, according to Worthing Borough Council. It was found on the seafront in Beach Parade, at Windsor Lawns in Worthing, and next to Perch on Lancing beach.

The Environment Agency is now investigating the situation after what they believe was palm oil washed up on the shore, and was yesterday due to take a sample of the substance. The council's coastal warden team removed the supposed oil, working with the waste team.

A spokesperson for the council said: ""Palm oil can get into the marine environment when it is legally released at sea by ships when vessels wash out their tanks. The resulting substances are often mixed with other chemicals such as diesel, making it extremely harmful if ingested.

""Washed up onto the beach, palm oil is white and waxy in appearance and can range in a variety of sizes from pebble sized, semi-solid lumps to larger blocks and can smell of diesel. Dog owners in Adur and Worthing are being advised to be cautious when walking their pets on the beach. If they suspect their pet has eaten any of the substance they should go to the vets immediately,"" they said according to The Argus.

Palm oil is often used in food manufacturing, for beauty products, as a biofuel, and to produce vegetable oil. Since 2014, it has accounted for around 33% of all global oils produced from oil crops. But environmental concerns have recently been raised regarding the use of palm oil, due to the levels of deforestation required to produce it. It has also been linked with human rights abuses regarding working conditions in the production process.

If anyone spots what they think could be palm oil then they can contact the coastal office on 01903238977.

Although dogs are a man's best friend, you still have to earn their trust. A vet has shared five signs you can look for in your pooch to tell if they really trust you

There's no doubting dogs are a man's best friend - but is the feeling mutual? The bond between a dog and their owner can't be underestimated, but you do have to earn your pooch's trust.

Contrary to popular belief, truly earning your dog's trust isn't as simple as giving them a few treats - you have to work for it. So does your pet trust you?

A vet has shared five signs you can look for in your furry friend to find out if they really trust you - and some of them might surprise you.

Veterinarian Dr Adam Christmann, who regularly posts content on his @dr.adamchristman52 TikTok account, recently asked in a video: ""Does your dog really trust you?"". There are five ways you can find this out, according to the expert.

The first indication that your dog really trusts you is that they learn your routine. Dr Christmann added: ""When to feed them, when to walk them, when to go to bed. Because once your routine is set, they'll trust that you'll hold up your end of the arrangement.""

The second this, which might surprise you, is that taking your shoe is a sign that they trust you. Dr Christmann explained: ""It's been said that they do it out of enduring reasons.""

Next is that you understand their body language. Dr Christmann asked: ""Do they lean into you or lean away but you respect their boundaries? The more you read their body language, the more they're going to trust you.""

One that might seem obvious is that they sleep in the same room, or even the same bed, as you, which Dr Christmann said you should consider as ""a gift"". He added: ""They sleep where they feel safe and trusted"".

The last way he shared to know if your dog trusts you is that they have eye contact with you. Dr Christmann explained: ""One of the ways dogs bond with you is through eye contact. It helps create trust.""

Does your dog trust you? Let us know in the comment section below.

A debate is raging over who should wear the armband for Manchester United, with Marcus Rashford's name cropping up as a potential alternative to vice-captain Bruno Fernandes

Ex-Manchester United team-mates Paul Scholes and Owen Hargreaves disagree over whether Marcus Rashford has the credentials to become the club's future captain.

After vice-skipper Bruno Fernandes was accused of an ""embarrassing"" performance during last Sunday's shambolic 7-0 defeat to arch rivals Liverpool, a debate has raged over who deserves to wear the armband. Club captain Harry Maguire has spent most of this season on the bench, allowing Fernandes to lead United out for much of Erik ten Hag's first campaign as manager.

While stars such as David de Gea, Casemiro, Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez have all been tipped for the captaincy, Rashford's name has also been thrown around by fans and pundits alike. Ahead of Thursday's much-needed 4-1 win at home to Real Betis in the Europa League, former Red Devils midfielder Hargreaves insisted that the 25-year-old forward has what it takes to bear the responsibility - but club legend Scholes isn't so sure.

Using Paris Saint-Germain vice-captain Kylian Mbappe - who's only 24 - as an example, Hargreaves told BT Sport: ""I think United have a lot of leaders now - De Gea, Casemiro, Varane, Martinez is a natural leader. I think Marcus could be one of those. You look at Kylian Mbappe at 24 he's the captain of PSG.

""I think he's [Rashford] not your typical Bryan Robson, [Eric] Cantona, that type, but he's the star player - he's been brilliant this season. He could have that responsibility and grow into the role. I wouldn't mind seeing that. He's produced after coming out of a really difficult phase and he's obviously the future of this football club.

""I think giving him more responsibility wouldn't be a bad thing, he could grow into it, I think captains are a lot different from what they were when we played.""

Have your say! Who should be Man Utd's captain? Join the debate in the comments section.

Scholes took a different stance, however, admitting: ""I don't really see him as a leader. I think he's a leader by performance but not quite vocal or as a character as a captain should be. One thing we have to say about Rashford is that he's been brilliant this season. He's turned his career around in the space of time, in three-quarters of the season.""

As for Ten Hag's verdict, the United manager won't be stripping Fernandes of the armband any time soon. Asked on Wednesday whether the Portuguese midfielder would remain vice-captain in spite of his display against Liverpool, Ten Hag replied: ""Yes, definitely. He's playing a brilliant season, he's had a really important role in why we're in the position where we are, and he's giving energy to the team - not only running a lot at the highest intensity but the right way and right direction.

""He's coaching players, he's an inspiration, but no-one is perfect, everyone makes mistakes, we have to learn, he has to learn and he will, because he's intelligent. I'm happy to have Bruno Fernandes in the team and that he's captain when Harry isn't on the pitch.""","https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29181522.ece/ALTERNATES/n615/0_Manchester-United-v-Crystal-Palace-Premier-League.jpg","Marcus Rashford has been tipped to captain Man Utd instead of Bruno Fernandes (Image: Visionhaus/Getty Images)",2,TRUE,FALSE

Monty Don won't appear on Gardeners' World on Thursday with presenter Adam Frost stepping in as the host remembered his beloved late pet Brenda on International Dog Day

Heartbroken Monty Don will sit out tonight's Gardeners' World after sharing his heartache over the death of his dog.

Monty addressed the death of his ""much missed"" pooch, Brenda, in a rare social media post on International Dog Day. He replied to a tweet from the programme's account, which showed a lovely photo of his pet looking out over a wheelbarrow.

Confirming he had said goodbye to her, he wrote: ""Ah lovely picture of Brenda. Much missed."" He was flooded with support from his fans after he paid tribute to his companion, who viewers didn't ever see on the programme. Brenda was one of two miniature dachshunds he kept at Longmeadow as the camera shy pups stayed out of the spotlight.

Monty is known for his love of dogs and often offers gardening advice to viewers alongside his two golden retrievers, Ned and Nellie. The 68-year-old is occasionally joined by his Yorkshire terrier Patti on the BBC2 programme but they won't be appearing this evening, it has been confirmed.

Instead, presenter Adam Frost will be taking viewers through some late-season tips as autumn swiftly approaches. He will be taking stock of his garden under the supervision of Ash the cat. Meanwhile, Frances Tophill visits a garden in Kent where the plants provide a non-stop buffet for insects.

A synopsis for the episode reads: ""There's a chef-turned-gardener who loves to grow all manner of unusual tasty crops. And there's a visit to a sloping garden in Swansea for some top design tips. Plus more of the amazing films that have been sent in by viewers."" There is no mention of Monty appearing on the show, so it seems unlikely he will make an appearance.

Animal-lover Monty regularly shares updates on his dogs, recently revealing he is besotted with a new dog, Ned, whom he confirmed is a ""˜replacement' for Nigel. Speaking before his pets had been introduced Monty joked: ""I haven't told Nellie or Patti yet""¦"" before he added, ""so it remains to be seen whether the three dogs will be best buds!""

But he need not have worried as video he has since shared with followers shows Ned and Nell rolling around and they look to have bonded beautifully. Sharing the joke on how popular his pets have become, he added: ""I am told there might be a little gardening too.""

Parents John Stanton and Trish O'Brien, both farmers, were driving through Ladysmith in New South Wales, Australia, when they smashed their vehicle into a tree leaving behind three children

Tragedy has torn a young family apart just days before Christmas after three children were orphaned when their parents were killed in a car crash.

Parents John Stanton, 40, and Trish O'Brien, 38, both farmers from Forest Hill, were on their way home when they smashed the vehicle into a tree in Ladysmith, near Wagga Wagga in New South Wales.

The mum and dad died at the crash site, leaving behind their three kids Teya, 17, Jack, 14, and Caleb, nine, who are now being cared for their relatives. In addition to his farm work, Mr Stanton volunteered for the local Rural Fire Service.

Their family friend has now set up a GoFundMe to support the orphaned children, raising more than $26,000 AUD (£14,000) in the short time it's been live.

On the page, Mel Cummin said: ""John and Trish were always together, partners in crime we could say. They were a massive part of the community and involved in many local fundraisers, and a part of the RFS community for many many years.""

Because they had been so busy with harvesting their crops, they had not yet gone out for their big Christmas shop, so there aren't any gifts left for the children.

Mel said all money raised on the GoFundMe will go towards providing the kids with some kind of Christmas, and to provide further support to allow them to grieve properly over the unthinkable loss.

""Both sides of the family are just trying to process the situation and what's happening and where we go from here""' Mel told Seven News. ""We're very community-spirited. John was a very big part of the RFS at Ladysmith which Trish was his backbone with, supported him with.""

Loved ones took to the platform to pay tribute to the couple. One wrote: ""She (Ms O'Brien) was a beautiful person inside and out. Thank you for the fun memories. You always helped people in need. We miss you.""

'My heart is filled with grief and sadness knowing the children have lost a wonderful mother and a dedicated father,' said another.

A coroner's report is currently being compiled as police continue to investigate the circumstnaces.

The Mirror spoke to families desperately trying to survive the sixth year without a rainy season - watching beloved children, siblings and parents die of starvation

One person is dying of hunger every single 30 seconds in East Africa.

It's the worst drought since 1984 - which led to the famous Live Aid appeals.

Climate change has seen six consecutive years without a rainy season.

In the small village of Lomirok I met Loripu Kiru who lost his 14-year-old daughter Nateen and his 62-year-old brother Eglan to starvation.

Standing next to him his grieving friend lost his two wives and four other close relatives.

As we talked a dignified elderly lady approached me to say she is mourning the death of her seven-year-old grandson.

He died just last month on March 3 - the boy's mother and father died because of the drought last year.

Richard Blewitt, executive director of international for the British Red Cross, said: ""The Africa food crisis is a catastrophic, deadly emergency on a scale we haven't seen in recent history.

""Right now, more than 140 million people are struggling without the food they need to survive.""

The United Nations has yet to formally declare an official famine.

But everyone on the ground knows it is an unprecedented situation and desperate action is needed soon to save lives soon.

These villagers' stories are not unusual. Every single person has a similar one to tell.

Lomirok didn't even exist three years ago. But it sprang up as people fled even worse areas and came to temporarily settle here - the only place they can call ""˜home'.

In a nearby village a mum cradles her severely malnourished baby not knowing if he will have the strength to survive.

In the mud hut next door a 90-year-old woman has been left nearly blind with a disease caused by dirty water.

Every single person we spoke to said the same: ""This is the worst drought ever.""

They pleaded for the world to stand up and take notice.

Loripo, 57, said softly: ""I have lost six members of my family including my beloved daughter Nateen. She was just 14.""

He then slowly repeats her age: ""Just 14 years old.""

He added: ""She is buried far away but I cannot visit her grave as I have had to move many miles away just to survive.

""My brother Eglan also died - he was 62. They both died because they did not have enough to eat.

""This drought and famine has destroyed my family. How can this be happening in today's world?""

Loripo invited us into his new ""home"". It is made of twigs and sticks.

There he told us he used to be the head of a happy and healthy family but the drought had killed all of his 40 goats, 20 cows and six donkeys.

His friend Jackson Namulen, 54, lost his two wives, which is allowed under Kenya culture.

Echankan, 46 and Kobie, 49, both passed away within three months of each other.

He said: ""They both died of hunger. They died of hunger in a country like Kenya.

""I had to bury them both in the ground.

""I feel very emotional about it. My life will never be the same again.""

Jackson also lost his livelihood. He said: ""I had 200 goats, 24 head of cattle and two donkeys.

""Now I have none. I live here now in this new village and have made new friends but I only survive because of the Red Cross.

""They have saved my life.""

Ekibo Ndot, 67, wearing her favourite pink jumper with roses, lost her seven-year-old grandson Lorot just seven weeks ago on March 3rd.

""He died of starvation,"" she said sadly.

""He was a lovely boy who had loved going to school but he was malnourished and just didn't get enough to eat.

""We all really miss him.""

It's a particularly tragic loss for Ekibo who lost her daughter and son-in-law as a result of the drought.

She died from starvation and he was killed as he tried to protect his family's remaining livestock.

Cows and goats have become so valuable now armed gangs ambush shepherds and farmers shooting them to steal their animals.

The death of so many millions of animals has meant there just isn't enough food for people to eat any more.

Each family used to have their own prized herds of cows and goats.

But with no pasture for the livestock to graze on almost all of them have died leading to a desperate lack of food which they would kill and sell.

""It's been a terrible time for my own family,"" said Ekibo.

""Before the drought we had 30 cows, now we have none - they all died.

""We used to have 200 goats, now we have two. They all died because there was not enough to eat.""

She watched as the other women in the village, which sits on the dusty El Baratheon plains, joined in a traditional tribal dance.

As they swayed they adapted the conventional words of the song by chanting: ""If it wasn't for the Red Cross we'd be dead like the cows and the goats.""

The dignity shown by the villagers in the midst of such grief is extraordinary.

Global warming has caused the catastrophic problems across the region.

The change in climate has had a severe effect on weather patterns leading to a lack of rain.

In Kenya the government has set up the National Drought Management Authority to try and help.

Joyce Kimutai, head meteorologist at the Kenya Meteorological Department, said: ""Climate change caused the low rainfall in the region.

""Climate change has made the drought exceptional.""

Unfortunately death has become a completely normal part of life now Doris Lengala is ""˜Nurse in Charge' of the Nauneri Dispensary and treats 2,000 people.

She said: ""There is severe malnourishment across the area. But there has been one big change.

""Men are now bringing in their wives for contraception ""That just wouldn't have happened five years ago.

""Their children are dying and they know they can't have any more, they can't afford to feed them.

""Some of the women who come in are young teenagers.

""I've had to deliver five babies myself because they couldn't get to the clinic on time.

One of her patients is Nteiye Lepirr's 14-month-old son Philippo who almost died last month.

He weighs 11 lbs. An average child in the UK would weigh 22 lbs.

""And that's after he put on weight,"" said Doris. ""He weighed just eight lbs last month.""

He survived because of the intervention of Doris's Red Cross clinic.

A special device which measures the width of the arm -shows red meaning he is severely malnourished.

Nyeiye, 25, has just found a job working in a tomato farm.

She earns 15p an hour for a 12 hour day toiling, shoeless, in the fields. That's £1.80 a day.

She said: ""I was very worried about my son's survival but now he is improving.

""There's a lack of water, lack of food, lack of everything ""He is severely malnourished.

""But hopefully he will be ok now.""

Mum of two Sabina Lenteye, 25, collapsed with exhaustion. In recent months she has suffered two miscarriages.

She said: ""I go to sleep hungry. My stomach is sore all the time ""I often go three days without eating - my children get food from my kind neighbour.

""I don't have the strength, I'm too weak to work.""

In the village of Lengesaka young mums patiently queue for medication. Next to them is the maternity and delivery ward.

It is outside and consists of three beds made of tree branches lashed together There are 2,690 people who live in Lengesaka.

More than 50 per cent of them are under 15. Only six per cent are over 60.

At the market cooking oil cost 71p for ½ litre two years ago.

It's now double that.

One kilo of rice cost 59p it's now 95p Sorobi Lesurmaat, 45, and her son one-year-old Paulo sat on the parched earth near her house.

She said: ""I'm very worried about my son.

""He has been severely malnourished but I just hope he gets better.

""We have no money and no food. I'm very weak. As soon as the sun rises I head out to make charcoal.

""I have the baby on my back. It's very hard work.

""I have only one meal of the day. I'm so hungry. But we have no meat, no milk, just rice and maize.

""This is terrible. It's the worst I've ever seen.

""We used to have seven cows and 40 goats. They have all gone. The drought has killed them all.""

Elderly Rantilei doesn't know her real age but said she is ""around 90"".

Four of her sons are dead through drought related disease.

She looks after her two-year-old great grandson Lteekua while family members fetch water.

Africa food crisis - how to help

The British Red Cross has an appeal to raise money to help.

Because of the war in Ukraine and the earthquake in Turkey and Syria, the drought has dropped off the public's radar.

A ""famine"" has not yet officially been declared but the sheer numbers of people dying brings back terrible memories of 1984/85.

Richard Blewitt, executive director of international for the British Red Cross, said: ""The Africa food crisis is a catastrophic, deadly emergency on a scale we haven't seen in recent history. Right now, more than 140 million people are struggling without the food they need to survive.

""But there is hope, with the right support and more investment from governments we can get help to where it's desperately needed.

""We know that money is tight for many people here in the UK, but if you are able to give what you can, our Red Cross teams on the ground can reach communities with life-saving aid and help build long-term solutions.""

You can donate at https://donate.redcross.org.uk/appeal/africa-food-crisis-appeal or call 0300 023 0818

The family used to have 100 goats and 50 cows. They are all dead.

The makeshift ""˜fence' around their huts is to try and keep the hyenas out - there's little point for it now.

She said: ""I'm hungry but we have nothing to eat or drink. Everywhere is dry.""

She has painful trachoma - an infection in the eye where the eyelashes turn in on the eyeball because there's no water to wash.

Water she has used is so dirty bacteria and infection thrive. The family eke a living by collecting goat poo and selling it by the bag as manure to a nearby farmer.

A 'gentle giant' dog is looking for his forever home, but his new owners will need to be understanding as he suffers with osteoarthritis and is overweight, so needs care

There are so many adorable dogs to choose from in rescue centres, and one 12.7 stone dog has been capturing people's hearts - and he's looking for a loving forever home.

Major, an 11-year-old Anatolian Shepherd, suffers from osteoarthritis due to his monster frame, and he also needs a ramp to get into a car. He is the biggest pooch the Dogs Trust in Loughborough have ever cared for - but volunteers describe him as a ""gentle giant"", who just needs a home where he can experience lots of love.

Major is currently on a weight-loss programme which includes regular exercise and a carefully managed diet, and his future owner will need to be mindful of this.

Celine Di Crocco, rehoming centre manager at the trust, said: ""Major is the biggest dog we have ever cared for. Despite his size, he embodies the gentle giant spirit that has endeared him to everyone at the rehoming centre. Major's story serves as a powerful reminder of the responsibilities that come with pet ownership and the potential weight management challenges in dogs.

""While being a bigger dog might mean there's more of him to love, it's essential that owners understand the importance of supporting their dog to maintain a healthy weight to prevent some of the health issues that come as a result of obesity.""

The charity says he enjoys human company and would love to live in a home where he can be surrounded by people. Despite his age, he loves playing chase and running around with other dogs. He can live with children aged 12 years and over, and the possibility of living with another calm dog exists, pending successful introductions at the centre.

Households with cats or small animals may not be suitable for Major. However, he could potentially thrive in an environment with other large animals, such as livestock or horses.

Nearly one in 120 residents of Bungay and nearby villages in north Suffolk described themselves as Satanists in the 2021 census. The figure is much higher than the national average

A sleepy town said to be haunted by a ""hellish monster"" has the highest number of Satanists in England and Wales.

Out of 8,500 people living in Bungay and nearby villages in north Suffolk, 70 identify as devil-worshippers, figures from the 2021 census show.

The statistic means that nearly one in every 120 residents claimed to be Satanists when asked in the census to state their religious beliefs.

The figure is around a hundred times the national average of only one in every 12,000 people identifying as a Satanist.

The country's next highest headcount of Satanists is in the Brondesbury area of north London, which has 20, despite having a far higher population than Bungay.

Church officials in Bungay have been reluctant to comment, other than saying they have no knowledge of any animal sacrifices or devil worshippers in their midst.

Civic leaders in the town, which has the ruins of a medieval castle and a Benedictine nunnery, have also expressed surprise at the data.

But some suggest that there may be a link to a local legend of the devil taking the form of a black dog, known as Black Shuck, which terrorised the congregation of St Mary's church in the town in 1577.

The folklore has been enthusiastically adopted in Bungay which has a Black Dog Running Club, a Black Dog Judo Club and a Black Dog Arts group.

A black dog also features on Bungay's Coat of Arms and on the weather vane which stands in the town centre, and a Bungay Black Shuck Festival launched in the town last year.

St Mary's church, which has been redundant since the 1970s, also has a large rock called the Druid's Stone in its graveyard.

Some local legends suggest that the Devil can be conjured up by dancing 12 times around the stone.

Bungay which dates back to Anglo-Saxon times and has a number of quaint Georgian buildings is the home of printers Clays which employs 700 people and prints 150 million books a year on its 14-acre site.

The 200-year-old firm is known for printing books under the highest security and most recently printed Prince Harry's memoir Spare.

The Fine Food Digest Awards also recently named Britain's best cheese as Baron Bigod, which is made in Bungay as a British take on classic French brie and named after the Norman knight who once ruled the town.

Bungay Town Council clerk Rosalind Barnett said: ""I have spoken to several councillors and none of them believe they have ever met any Satanists.

""So this number in the census is a bit of a mystery. Devil worship has never crossed our radar and has never been discussed. We don't know anything about it.

""The council might discuss it at our meeting in February under correspondence.""

The town's mayor Tony Dawes said: ""I was very surprised to hear this statistic. I have never come across a satanist in the town to my knowledge.

""We have the legend of Black Shuck, but that is as far as it goes. The churches in the town are very well supported, although I wouldn't say Bungay is an especially religious community.

""I am wondering if people with nothing better to do during lockdown decided to put down on the census that they were Satanists.""

Judy Cloke, a Conservative county and district councillor representing Bungay, insisted: ""Bungay is most definitely not the devil-worshipping capital of the UK.

""We have very strong church and religious communities and I find it quite insulting that someone is having a laugh at Bungay at the expense of the residents. It is very unfair.

""People might not have been telling the truth in the census. I just don't know.""

The Office of National Statistics revealed in November that 5,054 people in England and Wales had claimed to be Satanists out of a population of 59,597,300 in the 2021 census.

The figure represented a 167 per cent increase on the 1,893 who identified as such in the last census in 2011.

The 70 Satanists in Bungay either live in the town or one of the several villages to the south in a so-called Middle Super Output Area designated by the ONS as being called Bungay and the Saints. MSOAs in Suffolk have an average population of 8,500 people.

The latest census also revealed the number of Pagans nationally rose from 56,620 to 73,733, and a rise in the number of Animists - who believe that all natural things have a soul - from just 541 in 2011 to 802.

The 2011 census famously featured 177,000 people declaring themselves as being Jedi after the religion in the Star Wars films, making it the seventh most popular religion.

The move followed an urban myth email that promised to declare Jedi as an official religion if enough people claimed to follow it. The 2021 survey showed the number of self-identified Jedi had dropped to less than 1,600.

The Black Shuck dog is said to have burst through the doors of St Mary's Church as locals were praying that their homes would be spared by a huge storm on the night of August 4, 1577.

The so-called ""hellish monster"" is reputed to have run down the Nave killing a man and a boy, just as the church's steeple collapsed through the roof.

It then supposedly killed two more people the same night at Holy Trinity Church, Blythburgh, leaving the devils' scorch marks on the door which survive to this day.

St Mary's church in is still open for prayer and community events, despite no longer having services, but the town's Holy Trinity church is still in use, along with Bungay's large Gothic-style Roman Catholic church, St Edmunds.

Martin Evans, of the Friends of St Mary's Church, said: ""I have seen no evidence of Satanists at all. I can't imagine why anyone would put that down in the census, but we do have a lot of jokers around here.""

It comes after Chaplain Leopold, who co-runs the Global Order of Satan UK, told The Telegraph that during rituals, Satanists do not cast magic spells, make sacrifices or worship the devil.

He added that Satanism is now attracting an increasing number of young people who are disillusioned with ""outdated"" traditional religions.

Professor Linda Woodhead, head of department theology and religious studies at King's College London, added that Satanism ""is a young person's religion"" as she explained: ""There's now a lot of solitary exploration, particularly with the internet, and you can find anything to fit your particular identity, interests, values or beliefs.""

The legend of Black Shuck was immortalised in a song by Suffolk heavy metal band The Darkness. It also features in an anonymous Suffolk poem.

The Black Shuck poem

The church appear'd a mass of flame
And while the storm did rage
A black and fearful monster came
All eyes he did engage.
All down the church in midst of fire
The Hellish monster flew
And passing onward to the quire
He many people slew.
Many were stricken to the ground
Whereof they strangely died
And many others there were found
Wounded on every side.
The church itself was rent and torn
The clock in pieces broke
Two men who in the belfry sat
Were killed upon the spot.

Experts reveal the list of plants to avoid decorating your house with this festive season as they pose serious risks to pets - and the list's common Christmas favourite's may surprise you

As November fast approaches many households will be starting to spruce up their home ready for the festive period but there's a stark warning for pet owners as joyous plants, even as simple as a sprig of decorative Holly, can pose serious health risks to four-legged companions.

It won't be long until farms across the country start selling freshly wrapped trees, a go-to for many who love to fill their house with the smell of pine needles this winter. However, a survey from VetsNow has shown that a staggering 43% of family pets need emergency care after eating plants dotted around at home.

And research compiled by Clear It Waste shows an alarming number of Christmas favourites can be incredibly toxic if ingested. Mistletoe, Holly, and Christmas trees may be popular picks this winter but you may want to sway from using these if you have a curious pet.

Holly

The vibrant red berry classic, Holly has become a favourite pick thanks to its pointy dark green leaves and spots of red. While the points leaves could nick paws the real danger is in the tiny berries.

This is down to the Theobromine packed into the berries and, just like chocolate, it is highly toxic for cats and dogs as specialists say its vomiting, diarrhoea and high blood pressure side effects can even cause death in severe cases.

Yew

Similar to Holly above, when congested yew can cause diarrhoea, vomiting and even serious convulsions, all the same side effects often seen in adults. As stunning as the light green needle and brown coned trees are they are very poisonous, even if the attractive colours scream otherwise.

Again, it all comes down to the berries which contain a chemical called taxines, and even if you avoid these red fruits altogether traces can still be found in the cones and needles. So toxic when congested that they've previously been used in farming to deter livestock.

Winter Cherry

Also given the moniker 'Jerusalem Cherry' the orange-tinted berries on this plant couldn't be further from the juicy sweet forest fruits enjoyed by many. In fact, both humans and animals suffer from headaches, abdominal pain and vomiting if ingested.

The seasonal plants can easily be mistaken for tomato plants, thanks to their similar round fruits, so people are urged to take extra care to avoid dangerous confusion between the two this winter. Its poisonous solanocapsine is found in the unripe fruit and leaves of the plant.

Christmas Trees


For some, popping the Christmas tree up in November is perfect timing but as the needles start to fall it could pose a serious risk to your pets. The pointy pieces of pine can hurt their paws, and eyes and get stuck in the mouth, but the biggest risks come if swallowed.

Although tiny to the eye swallowing the needles can lead to blockages in the stomach and in serious cases even puncture the stomach lining, ouch! Needles aside tree shoppers are also being urged to avoid using fertiliser to keep it alive as the fumes can be dangerous to animals.

Poinsettia

The vibrant poinsettia flowers are everywhere at Christmas but despite being found in abundance at your local supermarket and garden centre they have a reputation for being hugely poisonous to both animals and humans, although it isn't as severe as it may seem.
Its vibrant leaves can leave pets with nausea and vomiting symptoms and the sap of the plant is known to cause mild skin reactions. However, experts including Clear It Waste say that is relatively safe to prop around at home, as long as you keep it away from pets and children.

If you think your pet may have ingested parts of any of these please contact your vet immediately.

The popular character from the animated films will be the face of a new campaign to teach children how to behave outdoors and follow the Countryside Code

Shaun the Sheep from Wallace and Gromit has been drafted in to help children respect nature.

The clay ovine will spearhead a fresh campaign from Natural England to encourage kids to escape to the outdoors.

Chief executive Marian Spain said: ""Shaun the Sheep and his endearing friends are the perfect illustration for the next generation of explorers on how to respect, protect and enjoy nature, whether in parks in towns and cities, at the seaside or in the countryside.

""We know that children care deeply about the environment and that 85% of children feel happy spending time outdoors, so it's really important that we help young people enjoy the invaluable health and wellbeing benefits that nature offers, while giving it the respect it deserves.""

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs claimed there was ""widespread ewe-phoria"" at Shaun's appointment as the ""new champion of Natural England's Countryside Code"".

The sheep would show ""children how to care for nature, follow signs and share the space with others"", it added.

Shaun the Sheep first featured in the 1995 film Wallace and Gromit: A Close Shave.

In the animated series and spin-offs, he lives with his flock at Mossy Bottom Farm, set in the North.

Officials hope the character will help teach youngsters how to behave while on adventures.

Natural England has updated the Countryside Code ""giving everyone access to guidance on how to enjoy the great outdoors safely and responsibly"".

Defra said: ""Under the updated guidance - which extends to all green space, waterways and parks in cities - people are encouraged to ""˜be nice, share the space and say hello' to fellow users of the countryside.

""The code has simple reminders to respect those working in the countryside; to dispose of litter responsibly; avoid feeding livestock; to not light fires; and to stay on marked footpaths to protect crops and wildlife.""

Natural England and Aardman - the animation firm which created Wallace and Gromit - have devised webpages to ""help inform children and young people about the messages of the code, and how to ensure the outdoors is a place for everyone to enjoy"".

Aardman's senior brand manager Rachael Peacock hailed Shaun the Sheep as a ""fun ambassador for nature"".

""It's great to be working with Natural England on this engaging and informative Countryside Code campaign,"" she said.

""We look forward to encouraging families to enjoy the outdoors respectfully.""

A woman was left at the end of her tether with her neighbours and his animals after his chickens would keep breaking into her garden - and her dogs were attacking them

We all know that keeping animals can be really good for our mental wellbeing, and no matter what your animal of choice is, you'll know that despite the endless benefits, they're definitely an ""extra responsibility"" for you to take on. That's why one woman was left miffed when her neighbour's ""zoo"" kept coming into her garden, ""tearing up things and chewing on trees.""

She didn't know what to do about it as her own dogs were attacking their chickens when they went into the garden - and the whole situation sounded like pandemonium. She took to Reddit's 'Neighbour's from Hell' forum to ask for advice.

She wrote: ""My neighbour has goats, chickens, and ducks living in their yard. We all live on one-acre lots outside the city so he's allowed to have all these animals. He has only put up chicken wire to keep these animals in the yard and obviously, the goats can just jump right over it. We don't have these kinds of animals because I don't want my yard ruined or the extra responsibility of animals, but his animals are constantly in our backyard and front yard tearing up things and chewing up my trees, bushes, and everything.

""We just moved here a year ago and are saving up to get that side fully fenced but it will be another year before we are able to. We've talked to him multiple times about keeping his animals out of our yard and he just disregards us. It literally happens every day and now my plants and bushes and my kumquat tree are all chewed up and ugly. Our dogs have attacked their chickens because they've gotten into our yards and I'm tired of the stress of my yard being torn up and also not being able to let my dogs out because their animals are in my yard and my dogs will attack them.

""How do I get this handled? It's been a year now of telling him to please keep his animals in their yard and him ignoring us. So at this point, I'm willing to do anything.""

In the comments, people were mad on behalf of the woman, writing: ""Start taking him to small claims court for any damage his animals cause. He'll either have to pay, fence them in properly, or decide it's too much effort and rehome them."" Someone fumed: ""If he neglects his livestock and they damage YOUR property it's definitely time for the law.""

296,"Over half consider dairy butter a key part of their diet - despite environmental impact","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/cows-dairy-butter-diet-environment-30125551","Over half consider dairy butter a key part of their diet - despite environmental impact

The average Brit eats dairy-based butter seven times a week - and just 13% would consider reducing their intake to help the environment

A third of Brits (32 per cent) are actively trying to eat less meat to reduce their carbon footprint - but just 13 per cent

A poll of 2,000 adults found that 53 per cent consider butter a key part of their diet, with the average Brit consuming it seven times in a typical week.

Nearly three-quarters (73 per cent) of those who insist on sticking to regular, dairy-based butter, rather than a plant-based alternative, say this is simply because they prefer the taste - despite the environmental impact.

And Brits would sooner ditch meat - such as beef, pork, turkey, or lamb - as well as cut back on driving, water usage, and buy fewer clothes, before they reduce their dairy intake.

But plant-based butter alternative, Flora Plant, which commissioned the research, revealed that dairy cattle globally contribute the methane equivalent of 3.1 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year.

And as part of its Skip the Cow campaign, Flora Plant - which has 75 per cent less climate impact than dairy butter - also commissioned three life-sized cow sculptures, to raise awareness of the harmful impact of dairy.

The cow installations were made by artist Ptolemy Elrington, using recycled materials including old car parts, water fixtures, and fast fashion.

The sculptures use half a tonne of these scrapped materials, and took 240 hours to pull together.

And they have been placed in locations across London, Aberdeen, and Newcastle, as these are cities which consume the most dairy butter each week.

Perran Harvey, senior global sustainability lead for the plant-based alternative, said: ""Given our research shows 63 per cent of people believe more needs to be done to raise awareness of the impact dairy production has on the environment, we are here to show people there is a really easy way to reduce your environmental impact.

""We've got no issues with dairy cows, we love cows - but the hard truth is that industrial animal agriculture is harmful to our planet.

""Livestock farming is responsible for at least 14.5 per cent of the world's annual greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore we urgently need to reduce the overreliance on dairy in order to tackle climate change.""

It emerged from the research that, while 65 per cent are concerned about the impact of food production, just 35 per cent would actually consider giving up certain foods because of their environmental impact.

And of these, it's meat which would be quicker to go than dairy - with beef, pork, lamb, turkey, shrimps, and prawns all at risk of being ditched because of their negative impact, before a single dairy product.

When asked about what plant-based products they consume regularly, oat and almond milk are the most popular items shoppers are turning to, while 16 per cent are having dairy-free spreads every few weeks.

More than four in ten (42 per cent) are doing so because they believe it to be better for their health, and 36 per cent because of the environmental impact.

To encourage more to make the switch, 63 per cent of those polled, via OnePoll, believe more needs to be done to raise awareness about the environmental impact of dairy farming.

Zero-waste artist Ptolemy Elrington added: ""23 years ago I decided that my sculptures would be exclusively made of recycled and second-hand materials, as I wanted to use art as a vehicle to get people to consider their ethical and environmental responsibilities.

""Right now, the most pressing global issue is climate change - therefore it is all of our responsibilities to make people sit up and listen to the ways they can make a difference, by using art as well as news and action.

""I am proud to team up with Flora Plant on their purpose to create a better planet for us and the next generations to live, breathe, and prosper in.""

The herd of cow sculptures were unveiled this morning at Riverside Grass on London's Southbank, Newcastle's Northumberland Street, and Aberdeen's Hazlehead Park, where they will be on display until June 1, with additional information on how dairy butter-loving locals can reduce their dairy-based emissions.

The news comes as the Met Office issue yellow weather warnings for southern England and Wales where high winds and torrential rain could continue until around midnight and into the early hours of Sunday morning.

Brits could see furious thunderstorms sweep across the UK before El Nino brings record-breaking temperatures.

It comes as the Met Office issue yellow weather warnings for southern England and Wales where high winds and torrential rain could continue until around midnight and into the early hours of Sunday morning.

People living in all towns south of Gloucester, Oxford, Leicester and Lincoln have been told to batten down the hatches and prepare for a full day of strong winds.

The Met has warned that short term loss of power and other services is possible, while public transport may also be delayed because of the gusts.

Meanwhile, all of Scotland and parts of the north of England are set to be battered by thunderstorms, with the Met Office warning that flooding could occur in towns and cities north of Lancaster until at least 11pm.

It also comes as El Nino, a global weather phenomenon that comes every three to seven years when the Pacific Ocean heats up and raises global temperatures, is set to wreak havoc on the UK in the coming months.

While the UK braces for high winds and raging thunder, much of mainland Europe is suffering a major and dangerous heatwave,

The searing conditions will heighten the risk of heat-related illness and even death with livelihoods also at risk as entire fields of crops and livestock are set to be decimated as Europe turns into an oven.

The heatwave called Cerberus - which is named after the triple-headed hound of Ancient Greek lore that guards the entranceway to the lower circles of Hell in Inferno by Dante Alighieri - which has created a sizzling atmosphere touching the high 40s.

Images from Croatia show tourists and residents from wildfires as others in Greece are seen trying to stay cool by wetting their heads with fountain water

Cerberus is an anticyclone that originated over the Saharan desert but has pushed north in recent days from Italy, now affecting Croatia and causing life-threatening wildfires.

Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey have all been put under the grill in recent days with the heatwave expected to turn up its intensity before the end of next week.

But Cerberus is just the start of the apocalyptic round of heat pounding the continent.

Looming in the wings is Charon - a heatwave with a similarly infernal moniker that is named after the ferryman who carries condemned souls across the River Styx into Dante's Inferno.

Five day forecast

Showers clearing overnight though persistent rain will continue across parts of west Scotland, Northern Ireland and northwest England. Winds will ease slightly however still remaining rather breezy by morning. Feeling cool in the wind.

Cloudy across Scotland with rain and showers, turning heavy and thundery in places. Sunny spells and showers elsewhere, although some eastern areas staying dry. Another breezy day, and feeling cool.

Staying rather unsettled into next week. Lighter winds than of late though a risk of the odd shower continues. Some rain likely, mainly in the west on Tuesday. Remaining cool.

Graham Teasdale is still taking bookings for his converted fire engine, despite being ordered to stop renting it out, with magistrates believing he's made thousands of pounds

A farmer who converted a fire engine into an illegal AirBnB holiday home is still taking bookings, despite being ordered to stop.

Graham Harrison Teasdale, 52, was served with an enforcement notice in 2020 but is still renting it out to holidaymakers, with bookings being taken as far away as next March.

Carlisle Magistrates' Court heard the fire truck was illegally left in place at Doddick Farm, Threlkeld, between July 2020 and December last year.

Teasdale told the court he did not believe it needed planning permission as it's on wheels.

Lake District National Park Authority officials pressed ahead with a prosecution after confirming he'd ignored an enforcement notice to remove it.

Sioned Davies, prosecuting, told JPs: ""It was booked up until January of the following year.""

Representing himself in court, Teasdale told magistrates: ""I built it myself, so I'm not getting rid of it. We've got to come to some solution, haven't we? It's not harming anybody.

""The only people against it are the local parish council. I've had over 16 applications into Threlkeld Parish Council and they've never supported it once.

""It if had been someone else's fire engine, it would have been passed.

""I can assure you that from where I live, I can see 150 mobile homes or caravans from my farm on other farms. I can't see why I should be punished for having one.""

Asked how much he charged holidaymakers to stay in the fire truck, Teasdale said: ""It varies from winter to summer; hundreds - £300 per week.

""I don't believe it's harming anybody.""

Magistrates estimated the financial benefit derived by Teasdale from the breach to be around £20,000.

The court clerk pointed out that planning rules applied to the defendant as they did to everybody else.

Teasdale applied to the Lake District National Park Authority for retrospective planning permission for the fire engine but was turned down.

Magistrates imposed a fine of £8,978 along with a £2,000 victim surcharge, leaving a debt to the court of £10,978.

There was no order for costs as no estimate for these was submitted to the court.

Teasdale asked if he could pay off the debt over five years, but magistrates ruled that he must pay at a rate of £1,000 per month.

The fire engine is still being advertised online.

According to the HostUnusual site, the 'quirky former engine' is 'uniquely equipped for a truly memorable family escape.'The advert states: ""After all, how many holiday cottages come so readily equipped with children's firefighter costumes and hosepipe, fire engine beds, a sauna... and a even a firefighter's pole?

""Better still, your location is truly magnificent.

""Positioned on a working farm at the southern foot fells of Blencathra, one of the most impressive fells in the Northern Lakes, this is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty that promises to take your breath away.""

Matthew Hoheisel revealed his 13-year-old son, Westin, discovered the two-faced calf at the family farm in Minnesota, US, which had four eyes, two mouths and two noses

A farmer was left ""in awe"" at his bad luck after a freaky two-headed mutant was born on his ranch - and it's not even the weirdest creature he's dealt with.

Matthew Hoheisel, 41, from Hillman, revealed his 13-year-old son, Westin, discovered the two-faced calf at the family farm in Minnesota, US, which had four eyes, two mouths and two noses.

The animal was found lying on the ground and, according to Matthew, he had never seen anything like it before.

He said: ""I was in awe. I never saw anything like it before. My luck in the farming world is not very good - so it was kind of like ""˜that's about right, I would get something like this'.

""Even my sister is surprised I continue farming with the poor luck I have; calves getting sick, calves getting stepped on - they find a thousand ways to die around here.""

It's not his first bizarre birth - a few years ago Matthew delivered had a calf born inside out, with its organs on the outside.

He continued: ""Seven years ago I had another calf that developed in a horseshoe-shape inside the womb and its internal organs were actually on the outside of the body.

""When I was working on trying to get the calf out - because I knew she was calving - I thought the afterbirth was coming out but it was actually the intestines and stomach.""

The farmer confessed he has ""bad luck"" when it comes to animals on his farm as the two-headed calf was already dead when his 13-year-old son discovered the calf.

Matthew added: ""I just have bad luck. I don't know how to explain it.""

The animal was a few weeks premature, and Mr Hoheisel thinks its smaller size may have helped its mother deliver unaided.

He said: ""I believe it died while being born because she might've had troubles and who knows what could've happened in the few hours we weren't in the barn with her.""

Matthew suspects the calf formed when an egg split - as if to form twins - but didn't finish separating.

He said: ""The way it looked, was as if the egg was starting to split and it got that far and just stopped.

""That's the only thing I can come up with.""

Now the 41-year-old has sent the calf to a taxidermist, and is planning to mount its head as a novelty.

He said: ""For us it's more of a rarity and we plan on hanging on to it.

""It's not something we're gonna set on the kitchen table but it's way cooler than a deer-head mount, I'll say that.""

The second season of Jeremy Clarkson's adventures on Diddly Squat Farm has beaten the BRIT Awards and Love Island to be one of the most watched shows in the UK with 4.3million viewers

Jeremy Clarkson 's second season of Clarkson's Farm has broken new records for Amazon Prime after it became one of the most watched shows after it was released last week.

The platform revealed 4.3million viewers watched the second season of the farming reality show, making it Amazon's highest rated show since the company began reporting viewing figures in November 2021.

The figures for Clarkson's adventures at Diddly Squat Farm even beat The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power which reached 3.2million viewers when it was released last year. The show was also watched by more viewers than Love Island and the Brit Awards.

The programme's success comes after its future was thrown into jeopardy following reports that Clarkson would be dropped from Amazon after public backlash to his criticism of Meghan Markle.

The father-of-three, 62, suggested people 'throw excrement' at the duchess, who he said he dreamt of being 'paraded around the streets naked'.

Both ITV and Amazon threatened to drop Clarkson following the scandal, and the former Top Gear presenter was forced to issue an apology as he branded his words ""disgraceful"" and that he was ""profoundly sorry"".

The second season of Clarkson's Farm also comes shortly after the Diddly Squat Farm Shop reopened, but with prices significantly higher.

The shop - which reopened on February 10 to launch the second series of Clarkson's Farm - is over 200% more expensive for essential items than the nearest supermarket.

The Cotswolds shop is reportedly selling a large loaf of sourdough bread for £5.95 a pop, which is 274.21% more expensive than a comparable loaf costing £1.59 at an Aldi supermarket, which is just a six minute drive away in nearby Chipping Norton.

Meanwhile, a box of eggs at Jeremy's shop is £3.20 which would cost £1.19 in Aldi.

But his milk - or ""˜cow juice' as he calls it - is £1.20 - only 1p more expensive than the same in the supermarket.

The price hike comes after Jeremy called on the government to increase the prices of food as he believes it's currently ""far too cheap"".

The former Top gear host made his comments in a a discussion about the farming industry, ahead of Clarkson's Farm returning for its new series on Amazon Prime.

Speaking out about difficulties the industry faces, Jeremy said that one issue for cereal farms like his is the increased cost of fertiliser, stating: ""Fertiliser is now costing £1,000 a tonne rather than £200 like last year.""

He added that farmers in various areas are experiencing a ""nightmare,"" before conceding he was in a more fortunate position as he has other ways of earning an income.

When the doors to the farm shop reopened, visitor figures were significantly down with just 14 customers seen visiting the shop, which is a far cry from the massive crowds and queues of cars that flooded the farm last year.

The pensioner, who was jailed for killing Fred Barras, 16, and seriously injuring Brendon Fearon when they broke into his isolated farm in 1999, may have to abandon his plan to appeal

Twenty years after being released from prison for shooting dead a teenage burglar, farmer Tony Martin says he still wants to clear his name but that his hopes are fading fast.

The pensioner, 78, fears he may have to abandon his plan to appeal to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, telling the Mirror: ""I've run out of steam.""

Mr Martin was jailed for killing Fred Barras, 16, and seriously injuring Brendon Fearon when they broke into his isolated farm in 1999.

He was found guilty of murder the following year but the conviction was quashed on appeal and he spent three years in prison for manslaughter.

Now - just ahead of the 20th anniversary of walking free in July 2003 - Mr Martin maintains that the manslaughter conviction should also be overturned. In an interview at Bleak House Farm where he shot the burglars, he added he has not stepped foot in the dilapidated farmhouse since the killing.

Mr Martin, who still owns the £3million farm, spends his time in a neighbouring barn and nearby property.

He also spoke of being a ""different person"" after being in jail.

Recalling the fatal shooting, Mr Martin said: ""I went to bed that night with the Farmers Weekly and a bottle of wine. I had the radio on.

""Suddenly, the house was broken into and my life changed. Does that make me a guilty man?

""Can you imagine it? It was a terrifying experience. You go home one night and someone breaks into your house and you get the police jumping on [your] back.

""I've had to live with that for more than 20 years.

""Suddenly, I'm this man that wants to kill people.

""I don't regret anything - what was I supposed to do? Hide under the bed clothes?

""Before I knew where I was I was locked up by the police. It's unlucky that I was the fall guy.""

He shot the burglars after catching them in the farmhouse in Emneth Hungate, Norfolk, where he lived alone.

A shot was fired at the raiders while they were in the stairwell. Two more were fired as they fled. Fred was hit in the leg and back, dying at the scene. His accomplice, then 29, was hit in the leg, and he survived.

Mr Martin was charged with offences including murder, attempted murder and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life.

At the trial, the prosecution accused him of lying in wait and opening fire without warning after previous break-­ins. Prosecutors successfully argued he had used excessive force in shooting the pair as they climbed out of a window.

It was claimed that in the months before the killing, Mr Martin had repeatedly threatened to shoot any thieves.

The prosecution also argued he had booby-trapped his run-down home in anticipation of a break-in.

It was added he had used an unlicensed shotgun and that his shotgun certificate was revoked in 1994 after he fired at a trespasser scrumping apples. The murder trial sparked a national debate, with some saying he had the right to defend his property and others horrified at the death of a teenager.

Speaking now, Mr Martin said: ""I'm surprised how quickly time went by in prison. When I was released I was a little bit lost. I sacrificed a lot of valuable time and I'm not the same person.

""When people see me they know me, but they know me on the basis not as a friend or an acquaintance, they see me as the guy who shot the burglar.

""They said I was waiting with a gun - I've had a gun ever since I was a child. I don't know any farmer that doesn't have a gun.""

Mr Martin is yet to submit a file to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, citing the definition of ""fresh evidence"". He added he fears he no longer has the fight in him to pursue his bid to quash the manslaughter conviction.

Mr Martin said: ""It's 20 years ago and I'm old now. I cope, but that's about all you can do.

""You may think I've got a chip on my shoulder but I'm bound to. I haven't met anybody who says I was wrong. I don't think people appreciate what happened. I've been naive, I'm too honest for my own good and I don't like dishonesty.

""I would like to appeal but you can't because you need fresh evidence. My idea of fresh evidence and their idea [of it] are different.

""I'd love to clear my name before I die but it may never happen. The law won't allow it.""

Mr Martin inherited the farm from his aunt 40 years ago. The farmhouse is now overgrown with trees and ivy. He says he lives ""in a lot of places"" and has a ""bolthole"" nearby. Asked why he never went back in the house, he said: ""I just don't, I don't like disappointment."" And does he like living in the area? ""No,"" he replies.

Some locals quietly praise Mr Martin for taking a stand against crime. One said: ""We had four break-ins. I know you're not supposed to say this, but what he did stopped the burglaries.""

But Mr Martin said: ""I'm not the sheriff, I just happen to be a farmer.""

He added: ""I bet there isn't a house round here that hasn't been broken into. It's cattle rustling country. People do what they like because they're not bothered whether they get caught.""

Mr Martin added: ""It's a defeatist thing to say but I know I would have been better off without the farm. But I'll not sell it.""

He has no time for his notoriety. In 2018, The League of Gentlemen star Steve Pemberton played Mr Martin in TV drama The Interrogation of Tony Martin, based on police interviews.

Mr Martin said: ""I told the person doing it that it was a waste of time, it would do no good. They carried on and did it. It was dreadful.""

He added: ""I don't agree with the police and the legal system. They're supposed to be impartial but they're far from impartial.""

Meghan Markle was spotted out and about at a farmers' market in Santa Barbra in the week, with the Duchess buying fresh flowers and enjoying 'simple pleasures'

Meghan Markle's latest outing shows that the Duchess is ""stepping away from royal drama"", an expert has claimed.

Towards the end of the week, The Duchess of Sussex was spotted out and about soaking up the Californian sunshine in her local neighbourhood without her husband Prince Harry. The former Suits star was pictured browsing the Santa Barbara Certified Farmers Market with a security guard and her beagle in tow.

While at the market, Meghan was seen buying flowers and chatting to locals, something that shows how she is ""taking advantage of the simple pleasures the upscale neighbourhood has to offer"" since stepping away from the British Royal Family in 2020.

Meghan is ""living a low-key life in Montecito, California"", according to an expert, who exclusively analysed photos of the former actress at the market that were obtained by The Daily Mail.

Senior therapist and relationship expert Sally Baker from Working On The Body explained how the photos show that Meghan enjoyed her wander ""like any other resident"" and was dressed casually without ""any ostentatious attire or jewellery"", which was a ""clear departure from the royal protocols and dress codes"". She added: ""It seemed to echo her desire for a more laid-back, drama-free lifestyle.""

As Meghan chatted with local vendors at the market, Sally said that she could ""easily sense the warm rapport between Meghan and the local community"". She went on: ""The highlight of her outing, however, was her purchase of bunch of beautiful flowers,"" with the market allowing her ""to indulge in the simple joy of picking out blooms for her home"".

""The sight of Meghan buying the flowers was a testament to her embracing the normalcy of her new life and a reminder of the life she lived before marrying into the British Royal Family,"" Sally explained, continuing: ""This outing underscores Meghan's intention to live her life as she and Harry created it.

""It is a far cry from the spotlight and scrutiny that she faced as a senior member of the British Royal Family. The Duchess seems to be enjoying the pleasures of a simpler, quieter life - shopping at the local market, engaging with community members, and relishing the Californian lifestyle.""

She concluded by saying that the laid-back, drama-free life Meghan is living now demonstrates her ""wish to step away from her royal duties and to embrace a more relatable, everyday existence"", with it also serving as a reminder that ""despite her global fame and royal status, she values the simple pleasures of life - like buying flowers at the local farmers market"".

Our Yorkshire Farm came to an end thanks to Amanda Owen and husband Clive ending their marriage last year, but fans of the Channel 5 series often wonder where the two farmers live now since becoming single

Our Yorkshire Farm stars Amanda Owen and her estranged husband Clive are both keeping busy post-split with seperate TV projects.

Amanda, 48, will be starring in More4's new programme Amanda Owen's Extraordinary Farming Lives, while Clive has stuck with Channel 5 as he stars in Beyond The Yorkshire Farm: Reuben & Clive with his eldest son.

But TV fans will remember the former couple best for appearing on-screen together with their nine children over five series of the hit show Our Yorkshire farm, which first aired in 2018.

And the future of the programme was thrown into doubt when Amanda and Clive announced their separation after 21 years of marriage last year.

Is Clive Owen still at Ravenseat Farm?

Our Yorkshire Farm fans were gutted when Amanda and Owen revealed they had called time on their romance and feared the popular series about their life on their farm in Ravenseat would come to an end.

Channel 5 confirmed the worst in November last year as they announced Our Yorkshire Farm following Amanda, Clive and their brood on Ravenseat Farm will not return not TV screens.

Daniel Pearl, Channel 5 factual boss, said: ""The Owens have become everyone's favourite farming family and millions have enjoyed watching their unique way of life. It's fantastic that we can now all follow Reuben and Clive on their next adventure.""

But while they may not be co-stars these days, Amanda and Clive are still happily co-parenting their nine children and living alongside one another.

While speaking to Lorraine Kelly last year about her new TV series, Yorkshire Shepherdess Amanda revealed Clive had been living on a neighboring farm since their split.

Her estranged husband is still co-parenting with Amanda and helping to raise their children who continue to live at Ravenseat.

Amanda said: ""We all have to get on. There's a lot to deal with as we have the land to manage, the animals to manage, childcare and everything else.

""So yeah, we just have to get on with it.""

Amanda went on to explain how Clive was content with the current situation but she still needs to take some time away for herself.

She added: ""Every morning, even if I am going to be out feeding the sheep, I take a little bit of self-care for five minutes.

""I put moisturiser on and a little bit of mascara and it makes you feel better about yourself.""

When did Amanda and Clive split?

Amanda and her estranged husband Clive are parents to nine children together who, in descending order of age, are Raven, Reuben, Miles, Edith, Violet, Sidney, Annas, Clemmie, and Nancy. The former couple first struck up a romance back in 1995, when Amanda visited Clive's farm in Ravenseat to ask for help.

The pair went on to tie the knot and welcome their nine children into the world together, with their family life documented for the hugely successful Channel 5 series Our Yorkshire Farm, but shocked fans last summer when Amanda addressed speculation about their relationship and subsequently confirmed they had split.

She wrote, in a joint statement shared in June: ""Clive and I have are sad to confirm that we have made the difficult decision to separate.

""This hasn't been easy, but we both believe it's the right choice for the future of our family.""

The statement continued: ""Although we are no longer a couple, we continue to work on the farm and co-parent together with our number one priority the happiness and well-being of our children.""

Speaking on Steph's Packed Lunch in October, Amanda confessed being separated from Clive after over two decades together was ""a weird situation"", before adding: ""But we're actually all just fine, just getting on with it.""

The farmer was stunned when their goat went into labour and those helping realised something wasn't right when the kids emerged - and it has left the community terrified

A farmer was left shocked after his goat gave birth to a ""˜half-pig half-human' creature.

There are fears the creature was cursed and could bring bad luck to the family. Some have even said the creature could be a ""˜mutant devil'. Josephine Repique said the pregnant goat went into labour earlier at the small farm in Sultan Kudarat, the Philippines. The two babies had to be removed by cesarean section but onlookers quickly realised something wasn't right.

There were shrieks of horror when one of the strange-looking animals emerged from the goat. Josephine said the baby ""looked like a pig, with a mix of human"". The small fur-less animal even had a naval - just like a tiny human. She said: ""We were shocked. We can't explain how it looks like that. All our neighbours flocked into our house to get a good look.""

Sadly, the two infants and the mother goat all died, sparking fears that the creature was a cursed ""mutant devil"" that brought bad luck. Josephine added: ""Nobody knows what it is, but it's not a goat. It's scary. We're all wondering why it happened and if it is bad luck.""

Dr Agapita Salces of the Institute of Animal Science of the University of the Philippines said the foetus appeared to have suffered a genetic mutation in the womb. He added: ""It is a possible case of genetic mutation. It is also possible that the mother contracted a disease called Rift Valley fever from mosquito bites and this caused the impaired development of the infant.""

Clarkson's Farm star Kaleb Cooper has reportedly trademarked his name as the future of the Amazon show hangs in the balance following Jeremy Clarkson's vile rant about Meghan Markle

Clarkson's Farm star Kaleb Cooper isn't letting the grass grow under him as he plans to rake in the cash amid the show's uncertain future.

It has been reported Amazon Prime has parted ways with Jeremy Clarkson following his vile rant about Meghan Markle.

However, Kaleb, 24, who has been a key figure in helping the outspoken host on his farming show, is now said to have trademarked his name in a bid to boost his bank balance.

The father-of-one wants to market merchandise and his services with a new logo submitted last month featuring his initials KC.

A friend of Kaleb's said ""He has used his name for his business interests since he started working at 13.

""Most people know Kaleb as being part of Clarkson's Farm but it's a lesser known fact that Kaleb is a successful farm contractor.

""As part of his business he needs to have a logo and domain name and so he has registered Kaleb Cooper Contracting Ltd,"" reports The Sun.

Kaleb, whose fiancÃ©e Tanya is expecting the couple's second child, formed Kaleb Cooper Contracting, offering ""agricultural contracting solutions in Oxfordshire"", long before he appeared on TV.

Jeremy revealed last year his wily co-star had struck a deal to buy cut-price human waste from Severn Trent to use as fertiliser.

However, he later quipped: ""That raises an interesting point.

""Would you buy food if you knew it had been grown using human excrement?""

Amazon Prime will go ahead with the already-commissioned series Clarkson's Farm and The Grand Tour, but reportedly has no plans to work with the controversial star after 2024.

The news comes as Jeremy claimed he emailed Meghan and Prince Harry on Christmas Day to apologise, after his hate-filled rant about the Duchess of Sussex last month.

The presenter said his bosses at ITV 's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and Amazon, who make Clarkson's Farm and the Grand Tour, were ""incandescent"" after his decision to share his disturbing thoughts with the public last month.

In a lengthy statement shared on his Instagram page, Jeremy said he ""really is sorry"" for what he said in the controversial column - all the way ""from the balls of my feet to the follicles on my head"".

However, following Jeremy's apology, the Sussexes responded with their own statement.

Their representative said: ""While a new public apology has been issued today by Mr. Clarkson, what remains to be addressed is his long-standing pattern of writing articles that spread hate rhetoric, dangerous conspiracy theories, and misogyny.

""Unless each of his other pieces were also written ""˜in a hurry,' as he states, it is clear that this is not an isolated incident shared in haste, but rather a series of articles shared in hate.""

Neil Parker moved his caravan onto a small patch of rough land in Wales that he says has been neglected for years - but his neighbouring farmer was not so happy about his presence

A man who took over a patch of abandoned land hoping to live there until he can claim it as his own has said his neighbouring farmer dumped rotting silage bales to deter him.

Neil Parker, a self-confessed ""land pirate"", moved his caravan onto a small patch of rough land that he says has been neglected for a long time, with ""no evidence of activity for decades"".

The man, in his 60s, said he has done a lot of research to identify the site on the A487 near Tremain in Ceredigion, Wales, as being available, Wales Online reports.

He added he is entitled to take Adverse Possession - a legal concept meaning that a person who does not have legal title to land and who did not buy it becomes its legal owner.

The law applies when a person possesses a piece of unused land for a long enough period to override the interests of the original owner, according to Property Investments UK.

But Mr Parker, who previously worked in health services, said the neighbouring farmer claimed he owned the land asked him to leave immediately.

The man said he asked for proof of ownership but did not receive it, so he continued living on the site for nearly a year, until the farmer took a ""more direct, heavy handed approach"" and removed Mr Parker's caravan, car and other property.

Mr Parker alleges criminal damage was caused and the farmer also blocked his access by dumping 20 bales of rotten silage in the entrance.

It took a whole week for Mr Parker to clear the bales only for the farmer to turn up and dump some more over the fence. Dyfed-Powys Police said it had received a report of theft in the Tremain area on April 6. A spokesman for the force said enquiries are ""ongoing"".

Mr Parker said it seemed ""remarkable"" that the police hadn't taken any action for what he says is ""criminal damage and aggravated trespass"".

Talking about Adverse Possession, Mr Parker explained: ""I entered the site, having done extensive research including the land registry which showed all the surrounding properties were registered as normal, but this plot, for whatever reason was not.

""Not only was there no evidence of use, but the plot contained one of the worst infestations of Japanese Knotweed I have ever seen.

""You basically have to put yourself on a piece of land and there are various criteria you have to meet according to the Land Registry.

""You have to stay on the land for 12 years before you can claim it and you have to use it, you have to secure it, you have to show that you're acting to possess it.

""The point is if you take adverse possession of a piece of land, the only person who can dislodge you is the genuine owner, somebody who has legal ownership as proved by title deeds.""

He added that he does not intend to leave unless the farmer can show proof of ownership, as he said: ""It would seem that in the absence of evidence, they seem to think that force and bullying will achieve the desired result.""

Planning laws mean he cannot stay there all the time but he is allowed to stay for 28 days in a calendar year. When he is not at the site, he has a house near the coastal town of Aberaeron.

Mr Parker has brought a mini tractor on site to try and clear the dense overgrowth and set about planting trees.

He has also used a dilapidated building to store some of his possessions so that he can ""demonstrate his usage of it"".

He accused his neighbour of ""bullying tactics"" and vowed to remain on the site, adding: ""I'm going to stay here. As far as I'm concerned this is bullying tactics.

""If the farmer had a legal claim on the land, he could easily get me off. I'm not there to cause trouble, I'm there to make a reasonable claim.""

Mr Parker said the site was last used for pigs back in the 1970s but since then it had been left neglected and abandoned.

He also claimed the farmer told him that they had never bothered to register the land because it had no value to them.

Fans of Channel 5 series Springtime on the Farm, presented by Helen Skelton, were left unhappy after the show was taken off air due to a repeat episode accidentally being broadcast

Viewers have been left annoyed after the latest series of Channel 5 farming show Springtime on the Farm returned - with last year's episode broadcast.

Fans of the series took to social media to air their dismay over the accidental repeat, with the Helen Skelton -fronted show taken off air.

Showing life at Cannon Hall Farm in Barnsley, the episode focused on welcoming some adorable four-legged friends to the farm. But, due to a technical error, Channel 5 showed an episode from last year.

One Twitter user wrote: ""What happened, watching a repeat of last year, gutted"", while another questioned: ""Is that what we think happened at the start of the show? Or was it always going to be a repeat?""

A third replied: ""They had technical issues so we ended up with a repeat"".

Other viewers were left disappointed after realising the episode wasn't new and took to social media to complain, reported YorkshireLive.

One viewer said: ""I thought I just had deja vu... Thank you"", while another wrote: ""Why are Channel 5 showing last years Springtime on the farm, where is the new series"".

A third chimed: ""What about showing the new episode that was planned for tonight. When will we see that one"" with another adding: ""How have you done that?!""

Another user typed: ""I think there has been an issue on channel 5 as there was a glitch before the start and it is showing last years springtime on the farm?!""

Someone else added: ""Why are you playing last years #springtime on the farm and not the new series, have you made a mistake as this is not the new episode, not very happy was looking forward to the series.""

In a statement Channel 5 confirmed it was a technical issue, saying the show would be back tomorrow (Weds) with the new series.

Channel 5 said: ""Apologies, we've had a technical issue with today's planned Springtime on the Farm. It will be back tomorrow at 8pm as planned, all new.""

One viewer responded: ""Feel like I've been cheated out of an episode hope we get an extra episode at the end for what we've missed. Caused a mass panic on all the pages haha.""

The restaurant in Yibin, Sichuan is being investigated for violating China's strict anti-food waste laws - a big issue in China as many elderly people have memories of losing their loved ones to the world's largest famine during the 1950s and 60s

A Chinese restaurant is in trouble with the law after challenging its punters to gobble 100 dumplings for a free meal.

Authorities are now investigating whether the restaurant in Yibin, Sichuan has violated the country's anti food waste laws by holding its ""king of the big stomach challenge"".

The rules said to win, the contestant would need to chomp down 108 spicy wonton dumplings, known as chaoshous, as fast as they could.

For doing so, the winner would bag themselves a free meal as well as a number of other prizes.

To entice patrons, the restaurant shared details of the challenge on social media. According to state-affiliated outlet The Cover, the restaurant was just one of many being probed for similar competitions.

Eating contests are more prevalent in Western countries, where winners can even earn themselves lower celebrity status for their gluttony.

One such contestant was Joey Chestnut, who gorged on 62 hot dogs in 10 minutes last week.

But in China, which has suffered intermittent famines throughout its history, the obscene food waste is often considered offensive.

Between spring 1959 and the end of 1961, 45 million Chinese citizens starved to death as a result of the world's largest famine - with many elderly people still having living memory of loved ones who died.

President Xi Jinping has himself commented on wasting food, describing it as ""shocking and distressing"". He also said that China's agriculture was the backbone of society and the foundation of national security.

In 2021, the issue came to public prominence when the government slammed bloggers who drew crowds by binge eating on live stream.

Restaurant owners face a fine of up to 10,000 yuan (£1,092) if they're found to ""induce or mislead customers to order excessively to cause obvious waste"".

Media outlets can be fined 10 times as much if they're found to make, publish or promote messages about binge eating and drinking.

Some social media users have slammed the government for its heavy handed approach.

""Is this counted as a waste? Why not let people compete for the biggest eater? Will the food not consumed there actually go to the poor?"" one user wrote on Weibo.

Another chimed in, slamming the government for food-related scandals, which included contaminated baby milk powder.

""You didn't regulate food safety ""¦ but this?"" the user said.

An abandoned kitty afflicted with rabies caused a mass rabies scare after it bit and scratched 10 individuals, including the couple who rescued it.

After being adopted by a couple in Nebraska, a cute stray kitten caused a significant rabies scare by biting and scratching them and others before it died.

A friend discovered the black-and-white tuxedo kitten, which prompted Madeline and Rich Wahl of Omaha to become cat parents. The Wahls named the sick cat Stanley. When the Wahls took Stanley to the veterinarian, he weighed only two pounds, had stopped eating, and was having convulsions. Additionally, one of his pupils was larger than the other.

The pair believed that their new pet was experiencing an adverse response to ringworm treatment. The veterinarian was shocked to learn that Stanley had rabies, despite having over two dozen other probable explanations for his ailment.

Stanley died the day after his trip to the vet's. Now, tests are being conducted urgently to see whether he infected any of the ten humans he is believed to have bitten or scratched, as well as any other animals he could have encountered. Medical professionals predict that if the disease spreads unchecked, it may affect seven million people in the central United States, The Washington Post reported.

""We haven't had rabies in forever,' said Sharon Mix, the vet, who took a note of the kitten's different-sized pupils. According to genetic testing, the kitten carried a kind of rabies that has never been seen in Nebraska before and is often associated with raccoons east of Appalachia.

In an effort to stop further infections, Douglas County Health authorities rushed to vaccinate 1,000 raccoons in the surrounding region. In humans, rabies is 100% lethal if treatment is not received prior the onset of symptoms. ""It's just something that can snowball very quickly,"" County Health Director Lindsay Huse said.

""The goal is to prevent this raccoon variant of rabies from establishing itself here in our area. This would cause a substantial impact if it happened and put many people in danger."" The CDC predicted that the virus may spread in a 24-mile radius annually if left unchecked.

The rabies strain may spread over the course of five years to South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas, endangering an estimated seven million Americans. ""We've never had a nine-alarm fire like this,"" said Richard Chipman, the coordinator of the national rabies program at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Ten individuals, including the Wahls, their friend, and veterinary staff members who had been bitten or scratched by Stanley, were contact traced by health officials in order to give them four doses of the rabies vaccine and one dose of human rabies immune globulin, which can neutralize the virus and cost up to $8,000 per person.

Queensland Police Minister Mark Ryan described the plane crash in Brisbane, which may have been witnessed by bystanders, as ""so sad on so many levels""

A couple has died after two planes crashed mid-air in a horrifying incident over an airfield.

Commercial pilot David Maddern and his wife Jan's amateur aircraft collided with another jet moments after takeoff in Brisbane, Australia. Debris from the wreckage was seen strewn across the airfield as emergency services scrambled to the scene. Incredibly, the pilot of the second jet escaped without serious injury.

It's understood the Maddern's plane was taking off as the second aircraft came into land on a separate runway at Caboolture airfield around 10:30am on Friday. Witnesses are being urged to contact the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) as officials examine the crash. Queensland Police Minister Mark Ryan described the tragedy, as ""so sad on so many levels"" while Queensland Ambulance Service senior operations supervisor Matthew Davis described the scene as ""incredibly confronting"".

The Madden's plane registration states it was an ""amateur-built aircraft"", while the second aircraft involved was a Piper PA-25 Pawnee, which is generally used for agricultural spraying. The unnamed second pilot's aircraft has damage to the left wing.

Queensland Police Acting Superintendent Paul Ready said the glider could have been on a joy flight over the Glass House Mountains. He told the Courier-Mail: ""I'm not able to speculate on exactly where they were positioned when they collided but I believe that it was in the process of landing and/or taking off. It's devastating that we've had a loss of life."" He also praised officers who were on the scene within minutes of receiving emergency calls.

Ready continued: ""It is at the other end of the runway, which is further from the Bruce Highway, but there will be people who may have seen at least some of the aircraft and then movements prior to their collision.""

Investigators from the ATSB say it will take at least six weeks before the release of a preliminary report. Caboolture Airfield caters to general aviation and ultralight aircraft and is not controlled by Airservices Australia. The Caboolture Aero Club said its members were ""deeply saddened"" by the loss.

One of the planes involved in the collision was registered to the Caboolture Gliding Club and the Piper PA-25 Pawnee was left on the runaway, as forensics examined the scene. Ready said the pilot was assisting police with investigators to try and piece together what exactly occurred and said the investigation was still ""in its infancy.""

ATSB Chief Commissioner Angus Mitchell said: ""Investigators will begin gathering evidence by mapping the accident site examining the aircraft wreckage, interviewing the surviving pilot and witnesses and collecting relevant recorded information such as CCTV and flight-tracking data.""

Using laboratory ferrets and mice, researchers from China and the UK found that humans could be ""vulnerable"" to infection from the H3N8 strain of bird flu at ""epidemic or pandemic proportions""

Scientists have expressed fears over the emergence of another pandemic amid the outbreak of a new strain of bird flu discovered in Chinese poultry farms.

A team of researchers from China and the UK studied a sample of H3N8, which is one of the most common strains in birds but little is known about how it is transmitted to humans. Using laboratory ferrets and mice, they found that humans could be ""vulnerable to infection at epidemic or pandemic proportions"".

Paper co-author Professor Jinhua Liu, of the China Agricultural University in Beijing, said: ""Importantly, we discovered that the virus had acquired human receptor binding preference and amino acid substitution PB2-E627K, which are necessary for airborne transmission.

""Human populations, even when vaccinated against human H3N2 virus, appear immunologically naive to emerging mammalian-adapted H3N8 avian influenza viruses and could be vulnerable to infection at epidemic or pandemic proportions. Acid resistance of influenza virus is also an important barrier for avian influenza virus to overcome to acquire the adaptability and transmissibility in new mammals of humans.

""The current novel H3N8 virus has not acquired the acid resistance yet. So, we should pay attention to the change in acid resistance of the novel H3N8 virus."" It also found that the virus could be passed between animals through respiratory droplets.

Professor Kin-Chow Chang, of the University of Nottingham, added: ""We demonstrate that an avian H3N8 virus isolated from a patient with severe pneumonia replicated effectively in human bronchial and lung epithelial cells [which line the airways and make mucus]."" The virus was ""extremely harmful in its effects in laboratory mammalian hosts and could be passed on through respiratory droplets"", added Prof Chang, who carried out the study. The findings come as a public health expert warns that preparations are needed for future pandemics.

Professor Devi Sridhar of Edinburgh University, who advised the Scottish Government during the coronavirus outbreak, said action was needed to avoid a repeat of that, describing it as a ""tragedy for lives lost but also the restrictions put in place"". More than 17,000 Scots who died had coronavirus listed on their death certificate, meaning the virus either caused their death or contributed to it.

Prof Sridhar, who has written a book called Preventable: How a Pandemic Changed the World and How to Stop the Next One, was asked about future disease outbreaks when she appeared at the Edinburgh International Book Festival. She said: ""In terms of the next one, we can't say what it is but there are signals.""

Speaking about bird flu, she said it was ""not good"" that the disease was now endemic in the wild bird population, with this resulting in flocks of birds such as chickens and turkeys ""in lockdown because we can't protect them without putting them inside"". Prof Sridhar added: ""We have enough signals to say there is a pattern emerging and that pattern isn't good in terms of the range of mutations we're seeing and it jumping into humans at some point, or other mammals that make the jump easier into humans.

""So we have to prepare - to avoid what happened, which was a tragedy for lives lost but also the restrictions put in place which harmed, as well, many people in terms of their livelihoods, mental health."" Prof Sridha explained she had written her book ""partly for closure for me of what was a very difficult couple of years for the whole world"" but also to capture the experience.

After the 1918 flu pandemic, she said that there had not been ""much written afterwards"", saying that ""people just wanted to move forward"", but she had written her book on the coronavirus outbreak because she ""thought before we move forward we need to remember and capture that"". However, she said that time has been ""wasted"" during Covid with Government leaders and health experts debating if action was necessary.

Prof Sridhar explained this was because coronavirus ""hit that sweet spot"" between being ""innocuous enough to live with"", with some people infected not having any symptoms, while also being ""dangerous enough to kill millions of people and hospitalise tens of millions"" across the globe. ""It had those characteristics of being asymptomatic in some people, and then killing others in their 20s, 30s,"" Prof Sridhar said.

""It was a very tricky one. I felt we wasted so much time in circles debating, 'is the fatality rate 1% or 3% or 0.1%', instead of actually working together and saying, 'how do we contain this until we have vaccines, antivirals (and) doctors understand more about this disease'. That, for me, should have been the focus.""

She continued: ""We spent a lot of debating is Covid worse than the restrictions - they're both bad. The question is how the next time do we reduce the lives lost and the impositions put on people's lives, and the cost to the economy and mental health, that should be where we're at.""

A large plume of dark smoke can be seen shooting high into the air above Archer Daniels Midlands plant in Decatur, Illinois, after the explosion on Sunday evening

An explosion ripped through a food processing plant and sent a tower of smoke into the air - leaving at least eight employees injured.

The shocking incident happened on Sunday evening after the explosion occurred shortly after 7pm at the Archer Daniels Midlands plant in the ADM processing complex in Decatur, Illinois.

At least eight employees were injured and transported to a hospital, the agricultural company said in a statement on its website Sunday. The company contacted the Decatur Fire Department but said it did not know the cause of the explosion.

The blast happened at the east plant within the company's processing complex, the ADM spokesperson said. ""ADM immediately contacted the Decatur Fire Department, which remains on the scene. Several employees were injured and transported to the local hospital for treatment,"" the spokesperson said. ""Our thoughts are with our colleagues. We do not have a confirmed cause at this time.""

A large plume of dark smoke can be seen shooting high into the air above the facility in a video posted by WCIA-TV. Decatur is located about 40 miles east of Springfield and about 180 miles southeast of Chicago, where ADM is headquartered. More than 4,000 employees work at the plant.

""ADM has been a member of the Decatur, Illinois, community since 1939, when we began construction on what was then the world's largest solvent extraction plant,"" the company's website says. ""Today, Decatur is home to ADM's North American Headquarters and is the single largest location and employee base across ADM's global footprint. More than 4,000 colleagues work here in Decatur every day to unlock the power of nature to enrich the quality of life for billions around the world.""

The fire comes just days after multiple homes had to be evacuated after a blaze broke out in Baltimore, Maryland. Video and pictures from the scene showed thick plumes of smoke billowing from the flames that had engulfed the city.

Firefighters rushed to the scene and were able to put out the blaze but the cause is still under investigation by authorities. It remains unclear if anyone was injured in the fire. The fire impacted six homes after starting at one residency and spreading to at least three more.

Baltimore City Fire Department wrote in a Facebook post: ""BCFD units on the scene battling a two alarm fire in the 300 block of A. Robinson Street, Southeast Baltimore. ""Companies arrived to find heavy fire conditions in the rear of a two-story brick occupied dwelling. The intensity of the fire caused it to rapidly spread encompassing a total of six dwellings. Fortunately, there are no reported injuries and the cause of the fire remains under investigation.""

The abandoned Victorian mansion, known as Redlands, last occupied in the 1950s fell into disrepair following a series of devastating fires. It is due to be auctioned later this month

An abandoned Victorian mansion with a rich and intriguing history is set to be auctioned off later this month with bids starting as low as £100,000.

During its glory days, the 16-room mansion boasted grand features such as a large entrance with stone steps, spacious reception areas, intricate mosaic flooring, enormous fireplaces, an expansive cellar, eight bedrooms, and servant's quarters. The exterior was equally impressive, featuring a balcony running the length of the first floor, a full-size tennis lawn, an orchard, gardens, and farmland.

Last occupied in the 1950s, the mansion known as Redlands was subsequently used for agricultural storage before falling into disrepair following several devastating fires. The house, near Cambridge, was originally built for Mr E. Sidney Thoday, a seed merchant, who sold it in 1910 to stockbroker William Stanley Spark.

After various changes of owners, after World War Two it was purchased by banker Mr F. L. Dawson but tragically, in 1956, a massive fire believed to have been started by an electric heater ravaged the home, destroying the interior and most of the roof. Today, the once-grand property stands largely dilapidated, awaiting new owners who are ready to undertake the monumental task of clearing and renovating this piece of history.

The home sits on a whopping 1.12 acres of overgrown gardens and there are a number of outbuildings on the property. Some of the original details that have survived include the building's red brick outer walls, stone flashings, a number of large chimneys and the vast reception room spaces.

The property is now owned by Mr Keith Tyler, who inherited the property from his father who bought it in 1959 for £900. Mr Tyler said his father bought the house to restore and renovate, however, he never got to fulfil his dream. He said: ""My father was a carpenter and joiner by trade with a sideline of rush cutting, and he bought Redlands originally to store boats and to have an area for drying the rushes.

""His dream was to renovate the property and to this end he accumulated a huge amount of building materials, and being an inveterate collector throughout his life, also acquired everything including cars, boats and agricultural machinery, much of which remains at Redlands. Unfortunately, age overtook his ability to complete a renovation of the property, and he died in 2007 aged 100 years, leaving his dream unfulfilled.

""Throughout the years my family maintained the grounds and harvested the fruit from the orchard which was stored in the cellar. I have many fond memories of spending the weekends here as a child, playing in the gardens and throughout the enormous house.""

Unfortunately, the home's bad luck continued with two more fires, the worst of which was in 1996. Mr Tyler, seemingly nostalgic, expressed his hopes for the future of the property: ""I really hope that someone falls in love with the romance of Redlands. It really is time for someone to take it on and bring it back to its former glory.""

Access to the property is granted via a private bridge over a dyke, as the main access has been temporarily blocked due to safety concerns. The sale of the property includes an additional two acres of land adjacent to Redlands, which are also being offered at the same auction with a pre-sale estimate of £50,000 - £60,000.

Ian Kitson, the director of Cheffins who is handling the sale, sees potential in the ruins: ""This is an amazing opportunity for someone to either recreate the stunning property which once stood on the site or alternatively to create something new in a much sought-after location.Despite the site needing some significant clearing, Redlands is a magical property in a fairytale setting, and for the right buyer this will be a truly unique prospect.""

""We are expecting significant interest from both developers and private buyers and are delighted to have the opportunity to offer this incredible property to the market.""

The home is completely private and invisible from the road. It's located just outside of Longstanton, six miles northwest of Cambridge. The village has a number of services including a supermarket, post office, a doctors and dentists surgeries, a recreation ground and a number of pubs.

People planning to travel to the Balkans from the US this summer are being warned after a woman died after contracting Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a tick-borne virus that can cause terrible symptoms including bleeding from the eyes

Americans travelling on holidays this summer are warned after a woman in the Balkans lost her life to a highly infectious deadly tick-borne virus.

On 30 July 2023, the public health authority of North Macedonia reported a lethal case of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) from a mountain village in the area of the city of Å tip in eastern North Macedonia.

The patient was a 27-year-old woman who worked as an agricultural worker and recognised a tick in the abdomen area, which was removed on July 19.

Two days later, on July 21, the woman developed a fever and was hospitalised between July 23-25 at the infectious department in the PHI Clinical Hospital in the city of Å tip. She was treated for her symptoms and diagnostic tests were performed.

On the day of discharge from the hospital, haemorrhagic symptoms developed, and the patient was referred and further hospitalised at the PHI University Clinic for infectious diseases and febrile conditions in Skopje, the country's capital.

During the stay, the patient was symptomatically treated, and laboratory examined. Due to her deteriorating condition, she was transferred to the intensive care unit but sadly died on July 27. A few hours later, the diagnosis of CCHF was confirmed.

A total of 69 of her contacts were identified and classified according to their risk. Four contacts were identified as high risk, 23 as medium, and 40 as low risk; while two contacts were discarded.

High-risk contacts were tested with negative results. High- and medium-risk contacts are being monitored for a maximum of 14 days from the day of last contact with the patient or other sources of infection, by taking temperature twice daily.

What is Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF)?

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a wide-ranging disease caused by a virus carried by ticks, specifically from the Bunyaviridae family, that virus triggers severe outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fever. It poses a public health threat due to its potential to cause epidemics with a high fatality rate (10-40%) and difficulty in prevention and treatment. It is prevalent in regions like Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and certain parts of Asia below the 50th parallel north, which is the boundary for the main tick carrier.

CCHF affects various animals, both wild and domestic, including cattle, sheep, and goats. Some birds, like ostriches, can also get infected and contribute to human cases. Animals contract the virus through tick bites, which remain in their bloodstream for around a week, allowing the virus to persist through the tick-animal-tick cycle. The primary vector for transmission is the Hyalomma genus of ticks.

Transmission to humans occurs via tick bites or contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and after slaughter. Most cases are seen in people working with livestock, such as agricultural and slaughterhouse workers, as well as veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible through close contact with infected bodily fluids, and infections can occur in hospitals due to inadequate sterilization and contamination of medical equipment.

What are the symptoms of CCHF?

According to the WHO, CCHF exhibits varying incubation periods depending on how the virus is acquired. Tick bites result in incubation of one to three days, sometimes up to nine days, while contact with infected blood or tissues leads to an incubation of five to six days, occasionally up to 13 days.

Symptoms emerge suddenly, including fever, muscle aches, dizziness, neck pain, backache, headache, sore eyes, and light sensitivity. Early stages may involve nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and sore throat, followed by mood swings, confusion, and later, sleepiness and depression. Abdominal pain might move to the upper right quadrant with liver enlargement.

Tachycardia, enlarged lymph nodes, and bleeding rashes on mucosal surfaces such as the eyes, eyelids, ears, inside the nose, inside the mouth, lips, the genital areas, the urethral opening and the anus, evolving into larger rashes (ecchymoses) and bleeding, are observed. Hepatitis is common, and severe cases could lead to kidney, liver, or pulmonary failure after the fifth day. Recovery usually starts on the ninth or tenth day after symptom onset.

How is CCHF diagnosed?

CCHF virus infection can be diagnosed using various laboratory tests, including ELISA, antigen detection, serum neutralization, RT-PCR assay, and virus isolation by cell culture. Patients with severe or early-stage illness may not develop measurable antibodies, so diagnosis relies on detecting the virus or its RNA in blood or tissue samples. Performing tests on patient samples is highly hazardous and requires strict containment. Inactivated samples can be handled in a basic biosafety environment.

For treatment, supportive care to manage symptoms is the primary approach for CCHF. The antiviral drug ribavirin has shown potential benefits in treating CCHF infection, with both oral and intravenous forms appearing effective.

Coffee or cream? Shoppers who ditch their daily commuting cuppa could get the powerful celeb-loved skincare product 'basically free' - here's how

When it comes to celeb-loved skincare products, there's a brand we see cropping up time and time again. Loved by Victoria Beckham, Kim Kardashian and Hailey Bieber to name a few, The Rich Cream by Augustinus Bader has garnered a dedicated cult following over the past few years.

And this Christmas, many beauty fans may have had the chance to try it out for themselves, with it being the most commonly-found product in beauty advent calendars this year when we compared the contents of 15 of this year's most coveted countdowns, with the moisturiser appearing in seven of them.

A 15ml bottle of the powerhouse product - the size many would have received in calendars from the likes of Liberty, Cult Beauty and Space NK - would usually set shoppers back £71. Many of these calendars retailed at £200-250, but were worth over £1,000, so it was a great way to try out the premium skincare product amid a high-end haul that would save money on the RRP.

And if you've fallen in love with it and want to repurchase it, or simply fancy a splurge on the luxury celeb-approved face cream, then there's a new way to save money on it. Due to popular demand, The Rich Cream has been made available in a new 100ml size, up from its previous 15ml, 30ml and 50ml options.

The new supersize tube comes in at an eye watering £405, however, we worked out how to make it feel a little more affordable. Shoppers would need to buy seven bottles of the 15ml Rich Cream in order to exceed 100ml, which would cost them £497, so that's already saving £92 on the price you'd pay in repeatedly buying the smaller size.

Similarly, you'd have to buy two 50ml bottles at £225 each, coming in at £450, saving £45 by opting for the bigger size. However, if you're dedicated to using the cream and are looking to save some serious cash in the long run, you can purchase it on a subscribe and save basis.

Customers who order The Rich Cream 100ml to come once every 16 weeks - which is the longest amount of time you can select - will be able to get it for £344 every four months, saving an extra 20 per cent. This is based on using one pump of the cream, once a day for 16 weeks.

This works out at £21.50 per week, or £3.07 per day, which is around the same cost a cup of takeaway coffee, right? So if you forego your daily drive thru, it could be a worthy switch to your routine. You do have to go through a minimum of three subscribe and save cycles, which would mean you would get a year's worth of The Rich Cream in that time, but after that you can cancel the subscription service, if you wished.

So, what makes the cream so good? The hydrating facial moisturiser claims to reduce signs of ageing including the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation, but you don't have to just take the brand's word for it as this beauty buy boasts hundreds of shining reviews from shoppers who label it ""˜the best', though some shoppers said it left their skin ""˜shiny,' so you might want to keep that in mind, especially if you're avoiding this effect.

The Mirror's Laura McKenna previously tried The Rich Cream for a month on her menopausal skin, and while it wasn't love at first sight, she did grow very fond of the luxe product. She said: ""Let me start by saying just how much I grew to love this cream. I was a little put off initially, as the thick and heavy consistency felt like sunscreen on my skin. Once absorbed though, it amazed me by leaving no residue or sticky feeling and made my skin feel smooth to the touch.

""Being menopausal, my face is prone to bouts of dryness and teenage-style blemishes almost all at the same time, and with falling oestrogen levels, an exhausting lifestyle and the occasional glass of wine, it certainly is not smooth or radiant 99% of the time.

""The brand recommends using the product for at least 27 days, as this is apparently the length of time it takes for the body to turn over regenerated skin cells, so I religiously moisturised using the Rich Cream for almost a month. Unlike some other face creams, this didn't make my skin feel super oily after application, nor did it make it feel dry or itchy. Miraculously it almost seemed to find just the right balance for my skin.""

She said the skincare saviour left her skin feeling ""˜soft and hydrated' adding how it ""˜smelt luxurious, but said ""˜the biggest issue of course is the price tag'.

But Laura concluded: ""The scientific genius behind its composition does still leave me very impressed. To find a cream that was simultaneously able to fight the dryness of my slightly more mature skin, while also being able to deal with blemishes and blotches without making it feel dried out or super greasy, is a thing of beauty that could well be priceless.""

Mum Stacey Hughes says her family has been left devastated after beloved cat Dobby died of the poisoning aged just six while Odin 'is not the same cat anymore'

A family has been left devastated as their beloved cat died after being poisoned by antifreeze.

Stacey Hughes wants to alert other cat owners in the area and warn them to be vigilant after her two cats, Dobby, 6, and Odin, 10 months, were both poisoned with antifreeze on the same day.

Sadly, Dobby could not be saved - and Odin is now ""not the same cat anymore"".

Stacey first became aware of the horrifying situation when her daughter woke her up on Thursday morning to tell her that her youngest cat was unable to walk.

Speaking to Grimsby Live, the 33-year-old mum said: ""My daughter said my younger cat, Odin, couldn't walk and couldn't stand on his back legs.

""I immediately took him to the Blue Cross, and they were quite surprised to see what a state he was in.

""He was OK in himself, but he just didn't have control over his back legs, his back end was going upside down, so they kept him in for testing.

""I came home to look for my other cat Dobby, and she didn't come home until 7pm that night after my friend found her.

""She came stumbling through the back gate and couldn't walk, so we immediately took her to the Blue Cross too. They admitted her straight away because they'd seen how Odin was.""

Staff were unable to carry out a urine sample on Odin because his kidneys weren't working - but after successfully obtaining a sample from Dobby, they were able to confirm that the cats had been poisoned with antifreeze.

""I just felt instant panic. I've got a dog as well so I was worried that someone had put something in my garden. It worried me that it was both of my animals because part of me thought, is it deliberate?,"" Stacey said.

When she checked the alleyway outside her property, she saw a pile of bin bags that had been recently dumped there. She believes this is where the antifreeze was.

She continued: ""There was quite a lot of rubbish, so we don't know if something was poured in there accidentally or on purpose. I'll never know if it was intentional.

""My cats hated each other. The whole time we had Odin, him and Dobby used to hiss at each other, so they didn't go out together. The chances of them both stumbling across it and drinking it just doesn't make sense to me.

""Part of me thinks, has someone done it because [the cats] were going in their garden?

""If it's deliberate I don't understand how someone would hurt an animal, but if it was accidental, maybe someone should use their brains a little bit.

""Antifreeze has got such a sweet smell and it attracts animals, so people should be a bit more mindful on how to properly dispose of it.""

Because Odin was found and taken to the Blue Cross quickly, he recovered after being given IV fluids - but Stacey said he ""isn't the same cat anymore"".

""He still tremors and he can't really sit up for a long time, he's not eating a lot, and he just sleeps all the time,"" Stacey said.

Tragically, Stacey was told on Saturday morning by staff at Blue Cross that Dobby did not make it, and died as a result of the antifreeze poisoning.

She said: ""Dobby had vodka treatment, which is basically alcohol in her bloodstream to stop the antifreeze crystallizing in the kidneys, but she went a bit funny after her first lot of treatment.

""Her breathing wasn't right and her heart wasn't beating properly, so they stopped treatment on Saturday morning, and by 1pm on Saturday, I got the phone call to say that it was best to put her to sleep.

""She was the most harmless cat in the world. My little boy had her for his whole life, the whole family are just heartbroken.

""I'm very emotional, I've got a blocked tear duct in my eye because I've cried so much. She wasn't just a pet, she was just a perfect cat, she was so loving, and now I'm just constantly worrying because Odin's not himself.""

Stacey said she hopes to raise awareness of her experience to other cat owners in the area, and wants to stress how important it is for people to dispose of antifreeze properly.

""If someone reads this and they think, 'I've got some of that', please dispose of it correctly. If Dobby's story helps people to dump it properly at least some good could come out of it.

""I just want to say thank you to the Blue Cross for everything they did for both of my cats.""

Tesco has followed Aldi, Asda and Morrisons in introducing customer limits on certain fresh fruit and vegetables as shelves are stripped bare at supermarkets across the UK

EU citizens are mocking UK shoppers by sharing pictures of supermarket shelves filled to the brim with fresh fruit and vegetables as food shortages hit Britain.

Tesco has followed Aldi, Asda and Morrisons in introducing shopper restrictions on certain fresh produce as shops struggle to get supplies due to reported supply chain disruption.

The UK's biggest supermarket brought in a limit of three items per customer on tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers as a precautionary measure.

Meanwhile, Aldi has placed limits on peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes as retailers warned the shortages - although expected to be temporary - were likely to last for weeks.

Asda has introduced a customer limit of three on tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflower and raspberries, and Morrisons has set a limit of two items per customer across tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and peppers.

Other supermarkets are understood to be considering similar temporary measures.

It comes after an initial shortage of tomatoes affecting UK supermarkets widened to other fruit and vegetables due to a combination of bad weather and transport problems in Africa and Europe.

Today, Environment Secretary Therese Coffey told farmers ""we can't control the weather in Spain"" when confronted with the news that supermarkets were limiting sales of fruit and vegetables.

But many online have questioned this explanation after observing that shops elsewhere in Europe did not appear to be experiencing the same problem - and instead believe the problem is a consequence of Brexit.

If you can't see the poll above, click here

One aggrieved shopper wrote: ""I've been to five supermarkets in the city of London and I could not find tomatoes. Brexit opportunities. Having no food.""

Another said: ""Gaslighting us all. Europe has no problem with tomatoes or any other veg.""

In an attempt to settle the debate, Simply Red singer Mick Hucknall took to Twitter and urged his followers in mainland Europe to share pictures of their supermarket shelves.

He wrote: ""For the sake of balanced fairness can some of our mainland European friends pls post photos of their supermarket food shortages? Tx in advance. #BrexitBenefits"".

The thread quickly became flooded with images of shelves packed with fresh fruit and vegetables, as one person wrote: ""Shelves brimming here in Italy this morning"".

Another tweeted: ""Certainly no shortage of produce in Southern Spain due to 'bad weather' (eh??)

""Have travelled extensively over the last 5 weeks between Alicante and Almeria. All supermarkets (have shopped most days in Mercadona, Consum, Carrefour etc) crammed with fresh fruit and veg.""

A third wrote alongside a photo of stocked shelves: ""Taken in my local Billa store 15 mins ago. Also spoke to manager... NO SUPPLY ISSUES on fruit & veg.""

It comes as farmers in the UK have cut back on their use of greenhouses to grow winter crops in recent months due to higher electricity prices.

Additional factors affecting the shortages are supply chain issues caused by the Covid pandemic, and a shortage of permanent and seasonal workers due to leaving the European Union.

Others have taken to social media simply to blast supermarkets over the shortage, with one saying it is ""not good enough"" and just ""unacceptable"".

One unhappy customer penned: ""I'm sorry Tesco, this is not good enough in your Dalmarnock store... lots more shelves with empty boxes throughout the store. Rising prices are bad enough, but lack of basic foodstuffs is unacceptable.""

Another social media user joked: ""Okay, so I have two tomatoes - willing to swap them for a two bed house or one bed flat in London"".

A few lucky fruit and vegetable hunters have emerged amid the current crisis however, with some sellers claiming only supermarkets are affected and local markets are the best place to find their favourites readily available.

One wrote: ""Take the supermarket shortage of tomatoes & salad as an opportunity to support small business. No tomato shortages here & only £1 per bowl.""

The official Twitter account for Bury Market moved to take full advantage of the supermarket issues, inviting shoppers to ""head down"" to stalls at Pete's, Paul Smedley's, Iddon's, or Zen's and ""grab all you can.""

Which stores are affected?

The British Retail Consortium says supermarkets are working with farmers ""to ensure that customers are able to access a wide range of fresh produce"".

An Asda spokesperson meanwhile said: ""Like other supermarkets, we are experiencing sourcing challenges on some products that are grown in southern Spain and north Africa.

""We have introduced a temporary limit of three of each product on a very small number of fruit and vegetable lines, so customers can pick up the products they are looking for.""

An Aldi spokesperson said: ""We are limiting purchases of peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes to three units per person to ensure that as many customers as possible can buy what they need.""

Tesco has now introduced a buying limit of three items per customer on tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers.

A spokesman for The Co-Op told the Mirror it has ""no plans"" to introduce buying limits of fruit and vegetables at this time.

Waitrose told said it was monitoring the situation but it has no plans on introducing buying limits in its stores, while Marks and Spencers have said they will not introduce limits as it has been able to ""mitigate"" the impact through different supplier routes.

German discounter Lidl has said it doesn't currently have plans to put limits in place.

Ocado have been approached for comment.

Fortnite error 93 will stop you from being able to join your friends games, we've searched and found some of the best ways to sort it.

Fortnite Error 93 has been plaguing the game for years now, it's an issue that keeps cropping up for players even years down the line. Here's what we know about it and how you can fix it.

Fortnite Error 93 is an error that prevents you from playing Fortnite with friends, either kicking you out of a party or not letting you even join the party in the first place. Unlike some other Fortnite Errors, there's no real rhyme or reason as to when or how it'll happen, and it doesn't matter if you're on Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch or PC, so it's a bit harder to figure out how to fix it.

We've scoured countless forum posts and threads on Fortnite Error 93, and compiled some of the best options that have been found to sort this issue out. Here's how you can fix Fortnite error 93.

How to fix Fortnite error 93

We'll be going through a few of the options to fix Fortnite error 93, starting with the least time-consuming and becoming more elaborate as it goes on.

Change your skin

It may sound silly, but for whatever reason changing your skin in-game seems to fix this bug more often than not. There's no known reason why this works, or even what skins seem to affect this, but several players have reported this working for them.

Restart the game

The classic 'turn it off and on again' technique has come in clutch once again. Some players are reporting that the problem will solve itself with a simple restart of the game. If that isn't effective you could take it one step further and restart your whole console or PC to see if that does the trick.

Change the party privacy settings

Another fix we've found while searching for remedies for Fortnite Error 93 is to change the party setting. If your party is currently set to public, then set it to private, or if it's set to private, try setting it to public. Since the error has to do with party matchmaking, tweaking this setting may be enough to do the job.

Check the servers

While Fortnite servers don't have major outages often, however, the Fortnite servers have many moving parts. While the matchmaking could be working as intended, the party or messaging functions may be down. You'll want to have a look at the Fortnite Server Status website and check that the section labelled Parties, Friends, and Messaging has the 'operational' tag.

Contact Epic Games support

Sometimes, the simplest answer is the best. If none of the above fixes are working out for you, then it may be worth getting in touch with Epic Games support. This may take a fair chunk longer than the other options, but it's the only way to truly guarantee your problem will be fixed.

From The Man of Steel and Watchmen director comes a Star Wars-inspired space epic launching this month

If you're wondering which big blockbuster you can get stuck into this Christmas, then we know just the thing. From writer-director Zack Snyder comes Rebel Moon, a sci-fi fantasy adventure of epic proportions premiering later this month.

In an original story from the Man of Steel director, Rebel Moon transports viewers to a quiet moon in a distant universe where a plucky band of warriors rise up against an evil interstellar empire. If that sounds familiar, then you're not alone.

That's because Moon almost became a Star Wars film. Back in 2012 - during post-production on Man of Steel - Snyder pitched his original idea to Lucasfilm to become part of the Star Wars universe.

Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Snyder revealed that he approached Lucasfilm's Kathleen Kennedy with the idea before the Star Wars sequel trilogy was a twinkle in the soon-to-be studio head's eye. But this partnership never came to fruition and Lucasfilm was eventually bought by Disney six months later in what turned out to be a blessing for Snyder, who now had free rein to develop his story true to his own vision.

Although having ditched any Star Wars-isms and developing his film as an original story, the Skywalker saga's influence on Snyder remains overtly apparent: Moon's otherworldly setting, a tyrannical empire ruling the universe and characters wielding lightsaber-esque molten swords, amongst other things. Rebel Moon is also heavily inspired by the work of revered Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurasowa, most notably Seven Samurai and its Western remake The Magnificent Seven.

The upcoming space blockbuster cost a reported $165 million to produce and is the first of a two-parter that combine to form an epic space opera. To give it its full title, Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire and Part Two: The Scargiver.

Here, we break down everything you need to know about Rebel Moon.

What is Rebel Moon about?

After crash landing on a moon in the furthest reaches of the universe, Kora, a stranger with a mysterious past, begins a new life among a peaceful settlement of farmers. But she soon becomes their only hope for survival when the tyrannical Regent Balisarius and his cruel emissary, Admiral Noble, discover the farmers have unwittingly sold their crops to the Bloodaxes - leaders of a fierce group of insurgents hunted by the Motherworld.

Tasked with finding fighters who would risk their lives to defend the people of Veldt, Kora and Gunnar, a tenderhearted farmer naive in the realities of war, journey to different worlds in search of the Bloodaxes, and assemble a small band of warriors who share a common need for redemption along the way: Kai, a pilot and gun for hire; General Titus, a legendary commander; Nemesis, a master swordswoman; Tarak, a captive with a regal past; and Milius, a resistance fighter.

Back on Veldt, Jimmy, an ancient mechanised protector hiding in the wings, awakens with a new purpose. But the newly formed revolutionaries must learn to trust each other and fight as one before the armies of the Motherworld come to destroy them all.

Who is in the cast of Rebel Moon?

Rebel Moon boasts an immense ensemble cast led by Sofia Boutella as Kora. The Algerian actress is best-known as the pale-faced Jaylah in Star Trek Beyond and as the titular Mummy in Tom Cruise's 2017 action flop.

She stars alongside Game of Thrones' Michiel Huisman as Gunnar and Deadpool villain Ed Skrein as ruthless Admiral Noble. Ray Fisher - who previously starred in Snyder's Justice League as the robotic superhero Cyborg - stars as Darrian Bloodaxe while Infinity Pool's Cleopatra Coleman plays his sister Devra.

The film's scrappy group of warriors is made up of Sons of Anarchy's Charlie Hunnam as Kai, Blood Diamond's Djimon Hounsou as Titus, Sense8's Doona Bae as Nemesis, Supergirl's Staz Nair as Tarak and newcomer E. Duffy as Milius. Rounding out the cast is Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins, who lends his voice to Jimmy, a mechanised knight who joins Kora's quest.

Is there a trailer for Rebel Moon?

Netflix unveiled the official trailer for Rebel Moon in November. It can be viewed here.

When Rebel Moon is released and how to watch for free

Rebel Moon will make its home premiere just in time for Christmas following a limited theatrical release. It will be available to stream from 8am on Friday, December 22 with its sequel - Part Two: The Scargiver - following closely behind in April 2024.

The epic blockbuster will be available to stream exclusively on Netflix and can only be watched with a subscription to the streaming giant which now costs up to £17.99 a month. But savvy shoppers can currently bag a free Netflix subscription with some awesome money-saving deals from the likes of Sky and EE.

Sky is currently offering Netflix in a bargain deal for £26 a month. Shoppers can get this amazing entertainment bundle with Sky Stream, Sky TV, and Netflix and save almost £90.

With September nearly at the halfway point, Brits could be forgiven for thinking that they've seen the back of the sun for one year, but an Indian Summer could be on the way to tear up the script

In the UK, it's fair to say we're not exactly spoiled for sun; with autumn about to hit, millions are resigning themselves to the fact that the colder days and longer nights are here to take over, but an Indian Summer could be on the way to save us all.

That's right, while festival season is done and dusted, we could have one last run of sun before we all get in the Christmas spirit.

The term refers to 'A period of unseasonably warm, dry weather that sometimes occurs in autumn in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere'. It often doesn't even occur until after the 'first frost', or more precisely 'The first 'killing"" frost'.

After extensive research, 19th-century lexicographer Albert Matthews, managed to track the term back as far as an essay scribed in the United States circa 1778 by J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur. Alas, he couldn't trace it to its original source.

But while its exact origins are uncertain, some theorised it was used in regions inhabited by Native Americans, who may have described it to Europeans. Some speculate that it had been based on the warm and hazy conditions in autumn when Native Americans hunted to survive.

As we all know, the warm weather isn't a permanent gift, thus reaffirming the religious beliefs of the Native Americans, who would view it as a gift from God, allowing them to survive after the loss of their crops.

But irrespective of exactly where the term comes from, in the way we understand it today, most of us are hoping it rolls in to save us from the cold.

At the start of September, we were hit with an almighty heat wave, prompting Brits to head out into the garden to sunbathe and chuck a couple of steaks on the BBQ.

Sadly, the 32-degree temperature on Saturday, which officially stormed in as the hottest day of the year, is a thing of the past for the rest of the month.

But fear not, as experts have predicted our Indian Summer is expected to arrive on October 2 - October 10, giving us eight days of glorious sunshine.

A forecaster for independent team Netweather, Ian Simpson, wrote on its blog: ""It looks probable that we will see one or two relatively settled interludes early on in the period with ridges of high pressure moving in, most likely from the south.

""Temperatures are likely to be above normal early in the period, but trending average to fairly cool late in the period. It will probably be drier than average for most, particularly in the west and north-west.""

To the delight of the public, he confirmed it would be ""sunnier than average"", with Wales, the West, and Southwest of England getting to enjoy the spoils first. Then the weather will move to the North, allowing everybody to enjoy the fun.

However, before we get there, we'll have to endure some pretty brutal conditions.

Speaking in the weekly weather watch Deep Dive on YouTube, Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said: ""That's likely to lead to some intensity, some reactivation, some heavier, more persistent rain for time as we go into Thursday as well.

""On Thursday and Friday, you can even get something (wind speeds) a little bit stronger in some places... Maybe around 60 to 75 miles per hour winds are possible; gusts are possible as we go through the early hours and into Thursday morning, so a really windy spell. It is going to be a windy picture across the UK.""

But once we've made our way through the chill, we'll have our reward, in the form of nine days of beautiful sun.

Republican Senator Rick Scott is calling for an investigation into Chinese garlic imports, alleging they grow the cooking essential with sewage fertiliser and that an 'existential emergency' is brewing

A United States senator has warned Chinese garlic is a national security risk to Americans and called for an investigation into the food item.

Republican Senator Rick Scott has urged members of congress to act against the unsafe Chinese garlic, which he believes the country is ""dumping"" onto Americans. He said garlic products were flagged as in a state of unsanitary conditions.

China has been the biggest exporter of garlic to the US for a number of years in a controversial and ongoing trade deal. But Senator Scott believes it is all part of a heavy tariffs plan from China to freeze the garlic market in the US, with increased tariffs seen under the Trump Administration.

A letter written by the Senator showed his concerns, referring to ""well documented"" practices China allegedly deploys to get their mass garlic trade into the US. He has also called for the Department of Commerce to take action under a specific law which allows the investigation into imports relating to the security of the US, the BBC reported. He wrote: ""All grades of garlic, whole or separated into cloves, whether or not peeled, chilled, fresh, frozen, provisionally preserved or packed in water or other neutral substance.""

Senator Scott argues all types of garlic should be looked into and that there is an ""existential emergency"" brewing in the garlic trade between the US and China. He added: ""Food safety and security is an existential emergency that poses grave threats to our national security, public health, and economic prosperity."" But previous research into the garlic trade found ""No evidence"" of sewage fertilisation being used by Chinese garlic farmers. A scientist has since suggested sewage fertilizer could even be ""safer"" than first thought.

The Office for Science and Society at McGill University explained the use of the sewage fertiliser in a report drafted back in 2017. It read: ""In any case, there is no problem with this. Human waste is as effective a fertilizer as is animal waste. Spreading human sewage on fields that grow crops doesn't sound appealing, but it is safer than you might think.""

I don't think I'll ever pay full price for a new outfit ever again

I love a bargain. I rarely pay full price for anything, always searching out discount codes, deals and offers. I'm a regular customer at sites like Everything5Pounds and the new River Island eBay shop, but I may have discovered a new favourite where I can update my wardrobe with my favourite labels for less.

The retailer - called Secret Sales - is essentially an online version of an outlet village where you can snap up outfits from popular brands like River Island, Topshop, ASOS and Miss Selfridge for as little as a tenner.

And with a number of events cropping up over the summer like weddings and festivals, I placed an order and managed to snag more than £150 worth of outfits for under £40.

READ MORE: Best Boots deals of 2023 that will save you money on skincare, perfume and more

The website is described as a ""˜premium non-full-price marketplace for fashion, sportswear and beauty brands', and has previously been featured on the Money Saving Expert website. It sells surplus, end-of-line and outlet stock from well-known brands at a reduced price, often as much as 75 per cent off.

I picked up three dresses with a total value of £154, paying a grand total of £37.39 including postage, meaning I saved £116.61 on my order compared to buying new. Usually I'd think nothing of spending £40 on a new dress on the ASOS website - but at Secret Sales, I'd snagged triple for less.

I picked up a slinky sheer check occasion midi slip dress from Topshop for £11.20, but it was supposed to have been £56, so I saved a whopping 80 per cent. The dress is beautiful although a bit long and has to be worn with heels, but would be gorgeous for a summer wedding.

I also went for an In The Style satin asymmetric ruffle detail maxi dress in ochre-Yellow, which should have been £52, but cost £10.40 at Secret Sales. This dress was another occasion number that had stunning ruffle detailing, and would be amazing for a special event this summer.

But it was the third and final dress that was worth every penny of the entire order, and has immediately become my summer go-to. The ASOS DESIGN Petite open back puff sleeve maxi dress cost me £13.80 instead of £46, and has a fabulous textured pink gingham pattern in a waffle fabric, meaning it never needs to be ironed. It has an open back detail which is perfect for the warm weather, and it's lined very well, so you can go braless, too.

My order was shipped the next day and had arrived within a week. The orders are sent directly by the brand or seller themselves - in this case, ASOS - and Secret Sales undertakes quality checks to ensure the best standard for customers.

ASOS joined the platform in January this year a bid to clear stock efficiently, with all of the selected discounted items no longer being available on ASOS as products will be housed on Secret Sales.

The partnership means visitors to Secret Sales can shop from a selection of up to 1,000 products from ASOS-owned brands, including ASOS Design, Collusion, Reclaimed Vintage, Topshop, Topman, and Miss Selfridge, all listed at a fraction of their original price.

But there are also dozens of other high end brands also available to shop from on the site, including Kurt Geiger, Burberry and Holly Willoughby's favourite LK Bennett.

What's more is that ASOS will be refreshing inventory fortnightly with plans in the pipeline to grow the selection of products available, which means I'll be able to update my whole wardrobe for every occasion for a LOT less.

Jag Weatherley, Corporate Transformation Director at ASOS, said: ""We're pleased to be offering Secret Sales customers access to ASOS products for the first time. It's been a huge effort from everyone involved to get this partnership up and running in a short space of time. We're looking forward to seeing how we can develop our relationship with Secret Sales.""

It's not the only retailer where you can get cut-price clothing and accessories, though. Martin Lewis previously spoke about a site called Everything5Pound on ITV's Good Morning Britain (GMB), where he explained that the site buys leftover and excess stock from retailers like Marks and Spencer, River Island, Oodie and Karen Millen, and sells it for a fraction of the price.

He explained that they're 'often not branded', so whether or not you get a high-end high street item is a bit of luck. I've previously ordered from the site and received dresses and skirts from Boohoo, Topshop and Oasis - so it is a bit of a brand lottery, but if you like the piece, £5-£6 is a very reasonable price.

A total of 32 villages from 18 countries across the five world regions were recognised by the World Tourism Organisation this year, in countries including Spain, Morocco and Mexico

The best 32 villages in the world to visit as a tourist have been revealed, including popular holiday spots such as Italy, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland.

Each year the World Tourism Organisation publishes a list of the finest, most-sustainable and most intriguing small settlements to visit across the globe.

The award schemes looks to highlight places that are a little off the beaten track and buried in the countryside, yet have managed to embrace tourists while preserving the environment and its community's values.

A total of 32 villages from 18 countries across the five world regions were awarded this year.

One village to make the grade was Dazhai in China's Guangxi region.

The settlement is built in an area with various ethnic groups and terraced fields of around 66 square kilometres that have a history stretching back more than 2,300 years.

Each year tens of thousands of people visit the village where a small group of homes are built into the hillside across from terraced fields.

Dazhai has a significant place within Chinese culture, having been held up by Mao Zedong's as a model agricultural village which others should model themselves off.

The terraced fields and exotic culture of the Yao ethnic group and their unique architecture attract hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.

Stories of how hard and diligently the villagers of Dazhai had worked to build the village, its crops and engineering marvels including a reservoir and aqueduct were propagated across the country.

Chinese tourism figures show that 32,000 people visited the village in 2004, compared to 798,000 in 2019.

Another entry on the list is Rupit, which is halfway around the world in Spain.

The village is situated deep in the Pyrenees mountains in Osona, where visitors are transported back to a simpler, rural way of life.

The small medieval Spanish village is filled with stone walkways and beautiful river views, while a nearby waterfall spills out into a pool.

The village has become a popular day trip from Barcelona and can be accessed via a two hour drive.

Millions of insects were seen filling the sky over the northern and western suburbs of MÃ©rida, near Cancun in Mexico - a popular destination for tourists due to the area's rich Mayan and colonial heritage

A plague of locusts has swarmed a popular tourist city, sparking horror of a ""biblical warning"" among locals.

Videos show the mass of insects painting the clear sky black in colour. The outbreak of locusts was spotted in several areas of MÃ©rida, near Cancun in Mexico. The city is the capital of YucatÃ¡n State and is rich in Mayan and colonial heritage, making it popular with thousands of tourists that flock there each year.

On Tuesday (5 Dec), millions of insects filled the sky over the city's northern and western suburbs, spooking local residents. Locust plagues are associated with the Book of Exodus, the second religious book of the Bible, and many people consider them an omen of an impending natural disaster.

After the insects' appearance sparked concern, the State Rural Development Secretariat (SEDER) announced that they were monitoring their activity and launching extermination protocols. The authority said they were a ""remnant"" of a polluted area in a nearby jungle and are ""expected to leave the city in two days"".

SEDER added that they will wait to see where the locusts settle at night, which they hope will be in a remote area, and carry out ""control protocols"" in the early hours of the morning.

One local commented: ""It's the end of times. Repent."" Gabriel said: ""Exodus 10: 1-20."" Alex wrote: ""We haven't seen this for so long. Yes it's a plague, but how wonderful!""

Someone else commented: ""Locust plagues have existed throughout history and are not a sign of the end of the world. These pests are a result of their ability to reproduce rapidly under certain favourable environmental conditions.""

In Biblical times, the locust was seen as a harbinger of doom. The most well-known reference is from the Book of Exodus, in which Moses warns the Pharaoh that the kingdom of Egypt would be ravaged by plagues should he refuse to free the Israelites and let them return to Canaan.

Of the 10 plagues, the eighth was a plague of locusts. Moses told the Egyptian Pharaoh there would be so many locusts will ""cover each and every tree of the land and eat all that is there to be eaten"".

Locusts were just one element of God's wrath, with the other plagues seeing the Nile turned into blood, frogs, lice, flies, mass livestock being killed, boils, hailstorms and fire. There was also a three-day period of darkness. The plagues finished with the death of every first-born human or animal.

WARNING: GRAPHIC INJURY PICTURES Cathrene Mieras didn't hear the cow charging towards her on a walk in Cumbria until it was too late and was hospitalised with horrifying facial injuries

A dog walker says she's ""lucky to be alive"" after an aggressive cow charged at and headbutted her during a countryside walk.

Cathrene Mieras was ambling through a field in Cumbria last month and had put the family pooch on a lead. The 26-year-old was lost in a podcast when she suddenly saw to her horror that one of the nearby grazing cattle was rampaging towards her.

Terrified Cathrene had no time to escape and within a split-second the 70 stone beast struck - headbutting her twice and leaving her with a ""monster"" black eye and ""wonky"" face. Screaming in pain, Cathrene believes her cries startled the heifer which then slunk off.

Catherene, an environment officer from Carlisle, was relieved to see the family's collie was safe, and staggered away from the field frantically calling her family for help. She was rushed to hospital where she was x-rayed and given medication for the pain.

Incredibly, Cathrene managed to escape without any broken bones, and is now recovering with a gruesome black eye. She also suffered jaw pain so severe she couldn't eat, living on smoothies for two weeks.

But the fitness enthusiast didn't let her injury hold her back placing third in a CrossFit competition and half marathon just three weeks later. Now Cathrene is urging others to stick to public footpaths as she did and avoid near the animals if they have 'any doubt in their minds'.

""I thought it was going to kill me,"" she said. ""It's the most scared I've been in my entire life. I started walking into the field, and the next thing I remember is I looked up, because I was looking down at the dog saying 'good boy', and this big brown cow was just charging towards me.

""It dipped its head and headbutted me twice. The last thing I remember is this massive head hitting me. It was just that one cow on its own. I don't remember how it got off me, I think I just screamed."" She added: ""If there's any doubt in your mind, or if you have a fear of cows, just avoid them.""

A keen walker, Cathrene says she has never previously been bothered about cattle or horses, and always sticks to official footpaths and keeps her dog on the lead near livestock. However, she believes the hot weather on the day she was attacked on September 4 may have meant the cows were more aggressive than usual.

At Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle, Cathrene was given painkillers through an IV drip, before being sent for an x-ray. She said: ""They couldn't see anything on the x-ray thankfully, it was just really really swollen so they booked me in for a follow-up appointment.

""It was two days before I could open my eyes again. It was more the development of the bruise in the days after that was more shocking because it just seemed to get worse. When my eye opened it was full of blood and you could see the visible swelling on my jaw and this big lump on my eye. I still have numbness now, I don't have sensation in my face.""

Cathrene is now trying to put the attack behind her, but admitted she was still afraid of going into any field with cows. She said: ""It's going to be a long time before I can be around them, I'm lucky to be alive. Apart from the fear of cows, I just forced myself to get out and about again. It puts into perspective how amazing your own body is at adapting and overcoming.""

326,"Tens of thousands of badgers sentenced to death by the Tories this autumn","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tens-thousands-badgers-sentenced-death-30891422","Tens of thousands of badgers sentenced to death by the Tories this autumn

Documents show the latest kill targets issued to marksmen in 21 counties as the Government steps up its controversial bid to curb bovine tuberculosis in England's cows

Tens of thousands of badgers face being slaughtered this autumn as the Tories press on with their controversial cull.

Guidance issued by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to Natural England recommends killing up to 53,234 of the creatures. Some 208,144 have been killed since 2013 under efforts to curb the spread of tuberculosis in cattle.

If marksmen kill the maximum number authorised by the Government this year, it would mean more than 260,000 of the animals have been sentenced to death over the last decade. Furious animal rights activists blasted the annual programme, warning: ""This unscientific onslaught is now pushing badgers to the brink of extinction in long-established cull areas.""

Badger Trust executive director Peter Hambly said: ""The local extinction of badgers is happening right here, right now; 260,000 badgers represent over half of Britain's badger population - there has never been an assault on nature like this over a decade in our history."" The cull is due to take place across swathes of the English countryside.

Documents show the numbers of badgers doomed in Dorset, Cornwall, Devon, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Somerset, Staffordshire, Avon, Cheshire, Wiltshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Oxfordshire, Shropshire, Warwickshire, Lincolnshire, Hampshire, Lincolnshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire. Cull supporters blame badgers for infecting cows with TB.

More than 38,000 cattle were slaughtered in England and Wales in 2021 to tackle the disease, which costs taxpayers about £100million a year. Opponents want farmers to implement tougher biosecurity measures - and hope a vaccine could eventually end the cull, with campaigners pointing to a jab which could protect cattle.

In February, the Animal and Plant Health Agency said field trials for a cow inoculation and new skin test for bTB had moved to the next phase. Mr Hambly added: ""The best way to deal with bTB is through cattle-based measures - enhanced biosecurity, such as restricting cattle movements and effective cattle testing and vaccination.""

National Farmers' Union deputy president Tom Bradshaw said: ""Bovine TB continues to have a huge impact on thousands of farming families across the country and the emotional, mental and financial strain this devastating disease causes is enormous. The current government strategy to control and eradicate bTB, which gives farmers access to multiple measures to tackle the disease, has been successful with reducing disease incidence.""

He added: ""It gives farmers, their families and their businesses much-needed relief. As bTB policy evolves, it is vital that this effective strategy maintains wildlife control measures where it is necessary to ensure farms aren't impacted. We will continue to work with government to ensure a successful strategy to eradicate bTB continues to be based on sound science and evidence.""

A Defra spokeswoman said previously: ""Bovine TB is one of the most difficult and intractable animal health challenges the livestock sector in England faces today, causing considerable trauma for farmers and costing taxpayers over £100m every year. We have always been clear that we do not want to continue the current badger cull longer than necessary. Our bovine TB eradication strategy has led to a significant reduction in this insidious disease and building on the progress made we are now able to move onto the next phase, including wider badger vaccination, alongside improved cattle testing and work towards deployment of a cattle vaccine.""

In a horrific killing, Keith Dimmick's decapitated head was found in the bathroom sink. Police have accused his son Bradley, who struggles with schizoaffective disorder, of murder

A man has been accused of killing his dad and leaving his severed head in the bathtub - and uttered four chilling words after his arrest.

Bradley Adam Dimmick, 35, is accused of killing 65-year-old Keith Dimmick and a dog in San Antonio, Texas, on October 13. The dog was found near the front door of the crime scene, the victim's body found in the living room, and his head found in the bathroom.

Officers were first called to the scene due to reports of a ""suspicious person"" peering into parked vehicles on the West Side of San Antonio. When police attended the scene and found Dimmick, he spoke the chilling words: ""I just killed somebody"".

Police dug into his statements, questioning him on what he meant - until he explained that he had killed a man called ""Dimmick"" at a home in the 2100 block of San Lucas Street. They found the door of the home unlocked and entered after no one responded to their knocks - before uncovering the horrific nature of the killing.

Blood smothered the ground inside the front door where the dead dog lay. A decapitated human body was discovered in the living room, with the severed head inside a bathtub according to the arrest affidavit.

""Apparent dried blood"" was discovered all around the home - including near the front door, the living room, the kitchen, hallways, bedrooms and bathroom, San Antonio Express reported. The home actually had three security cameras in the living room, driveway and front door - with the living room camera pointing at Keith's decapitated body.

Dimmick allegedly admitted to police that the used weapon was ""in the house"". Keith and the dog were both found with ""large stomach"" wounds and their ""intestines extruding"" out of their bodies.

His brother, Adam Knopick, told KSAT TV station that his brother suffered from schizoaffective disorder and once attempted to kill his mother. Dimmick's illness often presented concerning red flags, he explained.

Knopick said Dimmick had been placed into a mental hospital before his release, with Keith set to take care of him. He did not take his medication after his release - and Knopick says his father's death was avoidable had the mental hospital done welfare checks on his brother.

Dimmick has been charged with first-degree murder and cruelty to non-livestock animals, a third degree felony. His bail is set at $1.5 million.

Doctors told Charlie Hird he had a 50% chance of losing his left leg after he tried to save a couple from a cow attack and ended up being crushed by the enraged 70-stone farm animal

A man who survived a freak attack from a 'beserk' cow has told how he nearly almost his arm after the 70-stone mammal fell on top of him.

Keen walker Charlie Hird, 64, said he feared at one point that it was ""game over"" during the two-minute attack, which saw the enraged bovine suddenly turn on him when he stepped in to save a couple.

He had been out with a walking group on public land near Hallbankgate in Cumbria when he spotted a man across the field walking near a cow and her calf.

As the man got closer, Charlie saw the cow suddenly toss her head, and it appeared to try to gore him after throwing him to the ground.

A horrified female walker - believed to be the man's wife - then successfully distracted the beast, but was also pushed to the ground and kicked a number of times.

Brave Charlie then intervened, and drew the cow off by shouting and walking towards them, leading it to begin running at him.

After dodging the initial charge, he stumbled and fell into a gutter - and to his horror the cow landed on top of him, crushing the bones in his left leg and giving him a painful kick in the head.

Recalling the terrifying moment of impact, he told Nottinghamshire Live: ""When the cow fell on top of me it went black.

""I honestly thought, 'that's it I've had it, it's game over'. As she got up she kicked my head with her foot, that gave me a gash down the side of my head.

""I couldn't understand why I couldn't see very well, my eyes were full of blood. At first I didn't realise she'd stood on my leg. I tried to stand up and fell over, that's when I realised my leg was broken.

An injured Charlie then crawled along a wall and played dead in fear of another trampling from the cow, as his horrified walking companions rushed to his aid and dialled 999.

Shocking footage shared later shows a screaming Charlie being treated by paramedics before he was rushed to hospital in an air ambulance, where he was told by surgeons there was a 50/50 chance he would lose his left limb.

The retired chef underwent a successful six-hour operation to rebuild his leg, and spent three weeks in hospital before returning home and learning to walk again.

Charlie is now sharing his ordeal from October 2021 to highlight the importance of giving livestock plenty of space when out on walks, especially cows with their young.

The cow could be heard calling out for her calf at the end of the attack, and he says her search was what prevented more people from being hurt.

But says ""he doesn't blame the cow whatsoever"" as she was only protecting her calf, and still enjoys going out on walks today - despite his friend's fears that he would be having nightmares for months afterwards.

Speaking of what can others can learn from the experience, he said: ""My advice to walkers would be to give cows a wide berth, just quietly and calmly walk through the fields.

""If you're walking through a field and you see the cows are on their own, say on the left, and you see a load of calves on the right, don't walk between them. The cows will go to protect the calves so you could get really badly injured.

An enormous phallic feature mowed into the lawn at Bath's exclusive Royal Crescent has startled residents and tourists ahead of a Georgian themed Coronation party at the 18th century landmark

Residents and visitors to Bath's exclusive Royal Crescent were horrified to see a ""giant penis"" mown into the lawn just days before a Coronation party is held.

Pranksters appear to have drawn the phallic feature overnight to the bemusement of locals who have been left wondering who did it.

It comes of course ahead of the King's Coronation on Saturday and a party is due to be held on the lawn at the famous Royal Crescent in Bath.

Up and down the country people will be holding street parties to mark the historic occasion with the bunting already being put up and plenty of ornaments for sale in shops.

The Royal Crescent attracts large numbers of tourists each year and many take in the impeccable lawns and the new feature that has been drawn is in contrast to the surroundings of 18th century Georgian grandeur.

The Crescent Lawn Company, which was set up in 2003, is the current caretaker of the lawns which are redolent of the country's most lauded landscape architect and gardener, Capability Brown.

One of the most famous features of it is the 'ha-ha', a type of sunken fence popular in the 18th century that gave landowners the illusion of an unbroken 'infinity lawn', yet still with a boundary for grazing livestock.

The phallic feature though is unexpected to affect the celebrations on Saturday where people will be hoping to avoid the showers that are expected.

A flyer for the Georgian-themed Coronation party at the Royal Crescent read: ""˜'Celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Georgian era. Decorate your own regal crown, watch demonstrations on royal fashion and visit the Georgian Cook cooking up delicious recipes in the kitchen.''

Meanwhile people will be hoping to catch a glimpse of the Red Arrows who will be taking part in an historic flypast of Buckingham Palace on Saturday and people across huge swathes of the south of England may also get to see them too.

More than 60 military aircraft will form a flypast on May 6, 2023 and restrictions will be in place on the airspace above the North Sea, East Anglia and London .

The six-minute flypast for the King's Coronation will include the world-famous Red Arrows, 16 helicopters, the historic Spitfires of the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, the RAF's brand-new P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft.

Joint RAF and RN crewed F-35B Lightning II jets and transport aircraft from the RAF's Air Mobility Force. It will be the first flypast involvement of the RAF's new Envoy IV CC1 aircraft.

The route will take the planes over parts of Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex on the way to London before heading out of the capital towards Surrey, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire as they disperse.

Police investigating the felling of one of Britain's most beloved trees are now following a new line of inquiry - that a chainsaw was used and the cut was done as part of an online stunt

Police are looking into the possibility that the culprit behind the Sycamore Gap tree felling used a chainsaw - and was doing it as part of an online stunt, it has been reported.

Two arrests have been made so far, with a 16-year-old boy yesterday bailed out of custody under investigation, and a man in his 60s was taken into custody last night for questioning. And now Northumbria Police are reportedly following a line of inquiry that a chainsaw was used to chop down Britain's most famous tree in what was a stunt for engagement on social media.

Forensic officers were seen taking photographs and samples of the tree - once perched in a natural dip along Hadrian's wall - as police began to prove a launch to gain a full picture of what happened overnight between Wednesday and Thursday. Detective Chief Inspector Rebecca Fenney-Menzies said the investigation is in its ""early stages"" and they ""encourage any members of the public with information which may assist to get in touch"".

Discussions have sparked online regarding what to do with the wood from the famous tree, which starred in the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Northumberland National Park and National Trust bosses are expected to discuss this weekend what the best next steps should be. It could become a memorial carving or a giant totem pole in order to keep it as a tourist site and pay tribute to the fallen tree, the Daily Express reported. The National Trust said it is ""very grateful"" for the support from North East residents and those from further afield - such as those who have donated to a fundraiser which has surpassed £3,000 - adding that ""this tree was special to many, many people"".

Detective Chief Inspector Rebecca Fenney-Menzies, of Northumbria Police, said: ""The senseless destruction of what is undoubtedly a world-renowned landmark - and a local treasure - has quite rightly resulted in an outpour of shock, horror and anger throughout the North East and further afield. Any information - no matter how small or insignificant you think it may be - could prove absolutely crucial to our enquiries.""

The beloved tree has been a popular place for marriage proposals, walks, and to scatter the ashes of a loved one, MailOnline reported. One nature lover, Heather Sutherland, said: ""I am grieving all over again. I scattered my brother's ashes here. This was our place. This was a place in which I found calm and solace, my grounding and orientation. This place means everything to me. This is more than upsetting right now.""

However some experts have suggested the stump left by the felling may be able to grow healthy shoots - leading to hope that the tree can be salvaged. General manager of the National Trust Andrew Poad explained that it ""may well regrow a coppice from the stump"" which could mean we ""keep the tree"". He told the BBC: ""It's a very healthy tree, we can see that now, because of the condition of the stump, it may well regrow a coppice from the stump, and if we could nurture that then that might be one of the best outcomes, and then we keep the tree.""

But the head gardener at The Alnwick Garden in Northumberland, while agreeing the tree could be saved, said it ""won't ever be the same shape or as good a tree as it was"". He continued: ""It's worth a try but I think livestock and wildlife will potentially damage it as well. It'll be very difficult to get it back to the original tree.""

The Mirror has approached Northumbria Police for comment.

The Transport Minister said microchipping cats is the best way to reunite owners with dead pets, as campaigners want the law changed to force drivers who hit cats to inform police

Millions of cat owners across the UK could soon be legally required to microchip their pets - for a morbid reason.

The long-awaited law is set to be discussed in Parliament in the coming weeks and MPs are also considering which would require drivers to stop when they run over a cat.

Transport minister Richard Holden said microchipping cats would be the best way to reunite owners with their dead pets.

He claims that requiring pets to be microchipped was a better way of dealing with cat deaths, instead of forcing drivers to report the accidents as this would result in ""hundreds of thousands"" of reports to police each year.

Mr Holden said: ""Cats tend to roam unaccompanied and are likely to go out at night. Drivers also may not realise that they have had a collision with a cat in some instances, or small animals very similar to rabbits or other wild animals, which can also cross roads late at night.

Do you have a pet cat? Are they already microchipped? Will you get them microchipped? Join the discussion below

""There are also hazards associated with stopping to check whether animals are alive or not, especially if they are very small animals.

""Having the law to make a requirement to report road collisions involving a cat would be difficult to enforce, especially when, as members across the House made clear, Petplan have suggested it might be in terms of hundreds of thousands of these incidents being brought forwards a year.

""One of the things we have been really pushing on in the last few years is microchipping as providing the best way for reuniting owners with their pets when they have either been tragically killed, stolen, or a variety of other issues.

""As members across the House pointed out, we do have a manifesto commitment to introduce compulsory cat microchipping and we consulted on this last year.

""We are committed to introducing this and we will be laying the legislation for this in coming weeks for England, and I hope that devolved administrations will follow closely, as this is a devolved issue both in Wales, and in Scotland, and in Northern Ireland.""

Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi opened the Westminster Hall debate on the petition, which called on the Government to add cats to an existing list of animals which drivers must stop and report if they hit them while using their vehicle.

Ms Antoniazzi said many people considered cats ""as part of the family"", adding: ""This, alongside their independent natures, inquisitiveness and aloofness has helped them to be one of our favourite pets.

""Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, section 170, drivers are required to stop and report incidents of hitting a horse, cattle, ass, mule, sheep, pig, goat or dog.

""The act as it is reflects an understanding of animals having a financial value attached to them as livestock or as working animals. As such, cats are not covered by the act.

""But Olivia, our petitioner, and organisations including Battersea Dogs and Cats Home and the Blue Cross want this to change. Because there is currently no legal requirement to report, we simply do not know how many cats are killed by vehicles.""

She urged ministers to ""make good on their promise to make a legal requirement for cats to be microchipped"" as this would send ""a vital message that it is an integral part of looking after a cat "".

Perfect for any jilted lovers who are feeling sour ahead of the usually-romantic holiday

Although Valentine's Day is usually a day to celebrate love, for the recently scorned it can be a more bitter affair.

That's why an animal shelter is offering people the chance to get one back at an ex by naming a litter tray after them.

Then when February 14 rolls around, the scorned can rest easy knowing there are animals doing number twos over something named after their old lovers.

The opportunity comes from Animal Friends Humane Society, an animal shelter based in Hamilton, Ohio, US.

Beyond helping people get back at their exes, their mission statement, according to their website, is ""to promote humane principles, to protect lost, homeless, abandoned and mistreated animals, and to act as advocates for animals in our communities.""

Furthering this, they launched the litter-tray naming service. People taking up the offer are expected to donate $5 (£4.10).

The advert on their website exclaims: ""Don't spend this Valentine's Day down in the dumps!

""Instead, cheer yourself up while making a difference for animals in need!""

It continues: ""For a $5 donation we will write your Ex's name in a litterbox and give it to the cats, to let them do what they do best!""

The offer is open until February 12.

The shelter have also promised they will post a video on Facebook showcasing all the names they receive, in the litterboxes.

People hoping to take up the offer should either make the donation through Venmo or stop by the shelter in person.

Bobi is a purebred Rafeiro do Alentejo, a breed of livestock guardian dog, and has miraculously doubled the average life expectancy of 12-14 years.

According to the Guinness World Records, Bobi has lived his entire life with the Costa family in the rural village of Conqueiros, in Leiria, Portugal.

Australian cattle dog Bluey was previously the oldest dog to ever exist, and lived to be 29 years and five months old.

Bobi's birth date and age has been verified by SIAC, a Portuguese pet database, and the Veterinary Medical Service of the Municipality of Leiria.

While camping with her parents and seven siblings, eight-year-old Cadence Eastin was killed along with the family dog when a tree fell on their tent in Idaho, US

An eight-year-old twin girl was killed along with her family dog when a tree fell on her tent during a family camping trip.

The family was camping at the Boise National Forest in Idaho, US, last weekend when a dead cottonwood tree fell on top of their tent, killing Cadence Eastin and Sybil, the pet dog. Elmore County Sheriff's Office deputies were on the scene quickly, but after fruitless attempts to revive the girl, they declared her dead.

At the time of the tragedy, Cadence was present with her parents, Quin and Natasha Eastin, as well as seven siblings, including Cadence's twin, London. The tree that fell on her was discovered to be rotten at its base, the sheriff's office said. A message on GoFundMe said the family is completely heartbroken by the loss.

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US

They wrote: ""Cadence was a truly special child. In addition to always having a cheerful, happy nature, she was known for having a perpetual and warm smile. She loved animals and they loved her. It is especially revealing that the family dog was curled up next to her when the tree fell taking both of their lives.""

""Cadence was bright, intelligent and an eager-to-learn student. Curiously, she almost always hung out with the adults at family gatherings and seemed to have been gifted with a higher intellect than would normally be expected of an 8-year-old child. Being raised in a Christian family, she was taught to be kind to others, made friends easily and avoided quarreling with others."" More than $28,000 has already been raised on the page to assist with covering the funeral expenses.

Police have spoken with representatives from the Boise National Forest to ascertain the precise cause of the tree's collapse. The Elk and Pony complex fires in 2013 had scorched the region where the tree had fallen. It left behind a number of burned-out trees, which had eroded over time and become unstable.

The scenery, wildlife, cabin owners, ranchers, and tourists were all significantly impacted by the Pony and Elk complex wildfires at Mountain Home. The fires raged from Black's Creek to Featherville, devouring 280,000 acres of rangelands and woodlands in a couple of days after being started by lightning in temperatures over 100 degrees.

Thirty-eight residences and 43 outbuildings in the area of Pine and Fall Creek were also destroyed by the fires, according to idrange.org.

Federal authorities halted access to camping and fishing along the well-known South Fork as soon as the fires were put out. More than 20 ranchers had to withdraw their livestock from the burn zone for at least two years in order to give the land time to recuperate. Additionally, 150 miles of ATV routes in the Danksins were closed.

Luan Nam, 72, died after being dragged into the crocodile enclosure at his reptile farm in Cambodia. The local police chief said reptiles attacked the man until he was dead

A 72-year-old reptile farmer has been killed by 40 of his own crocodiles when he fell into their enclosure, police have said.

Luan Nam was reportedly trying to move a crocodile out of a cage where the reptile had laid eggs when the animal ""attacked the stick"" he was using as a goad, causing him to fall into the enclosure in Siem Reap, Cambodia.

Local police chief Mey Savry said 40 crocodiles ripped the man's body to shreds, with a pool of blood left in the enclosure.

He explained: ""While he was chasing a crocodile out of an egg-laying cage, the crocodile attacked the stick, causing him to fall into the enclosure.

""Then other crocodiles pounced, attacking him until he was dead.""

A chilling pictured taken after the tragic incident shows a crocodile with the man's flip-flop in its mouth.

Mr Savry said the farmer's body was full of bite marks - and he reportedly lost both arms and a leg, that the crocs had swallowed.

Mr Nam's body was later transported to the family home in the countryside village of Po Banteay Chey.

Commune chief May Sameth told AFP that Mr Nam's family had urged him for years to stop raising the reptiles but he had continued doing so as he was the president of the local crocodile farmers' association.

According to reports, the victim's family may now sell the crocodiles.

A similar incident involving crocodiles saw a two-year-old girl be killed and eaten by the reptiles in 2019 while walking around her family's farm.

Local authorities said Rom Roath Neary left the house alone to play around the farm but fell into a crocodile pit and she was not seen alive again.

Police said the girl's dad only found her skull in the enclosure, which had a fence with gaps small enough for children to go through.

Captain Chamnan, Siem Reap's deputy police chief, said: ""Her father found only her skull in the crocodile enclosure, where she was killed by crocodiles.""

There are a number of crocodile farms around Siem Reap, which is the second-largest city in Cambodia and a major tourist hotspot as it is located next to the temple complex of Angkor Wat.

Crocodiles are mainly farmed for their eggs, skin and meat as well as for trade.

Love Island stars Will and Casey seem to have buried the hatchet after awkward scenes on Love Island Aftersun, where Will branded his pal a snake over comments made about girlfriend Jessie

It looks like Love Island's Casey O'Gorman and Will Young have put their row behind them after the farmer branded his villa best mate a 'snake'.

Both Casey and Will, and their partners Rosie Seabrook and Jessie Wynter have flown back from South Africa, meaning they won't take part in the Love Island final filming in South Africa, airing this evening.

And it seems Will and Casey have made up after a heated exchange on Love Island Aftersun, as Casey shared a smiling photo of himself and Will flying home on Instagram, writing: ""London bound.""

Casey also shared a short clip of himself, Rosie, Jessie and Will walking in an airport and posing for the camera.

Will and Jessie, who are boyfriend and girlfriend, were dumped from the villa just one day before the final and, after their axing, the pair appeared on Aftersun with host Maya Jama.

As the couple sat down, the couple were shown clips from their time on the show and were shocked to see Casey share his thoughts and claimed Jessie was being ""fake"" and ""playing games"" with her now-boyfriend, farmer Will - despite him previously insisting he hadn't made the claim about the Aussie beauty.

A clip was shown of Casey speaking to Maxwell, saying: ""The way she was speaking to me, it seemed like such an act.""

But another video saw Casey and Will discussing the accusations, with him claiming it was Maxwell who instigated the speculation.

Speaking to Will, Casey said: ""He doesn't feel she's being genuine,"" before the farmer asked: ""Do you think she's being genuine?"" before Casey dramatically claimed: ""Yeah, I think she is.""

But it appeared to become too much for Will as he directed his anger towards Casey who was sitting in the Aftersun audience before loudly branding him a ""snake"".

However, Casey attempted to clear his name by saying: ""We actually spoke about that.""

Will then fumed: ""I said so many times, be honest with me, be open with me and the boy lied.""

""Me and Will, straight after that, I said I felt like it was a complete act, did I not?"" asked Casey before a frustrated Will responded: ""Roll the tapes, just roll the tapes.""

Casey and Rosie were dumped before Will and Jessie, and now only four couples remain; Tom and Samie, Kai and Sanam, Shaq and Tanya and Ron and Lana.

Whoever wins, the finalists might be disappointed by the number of followers on their Instagram accounts, when they are handed back their phones.

Previous years have seen the show's stars emerge to millions of new followers, with contestants snagging brand deals.

But this year, the contestants' family and friends were banned from taking control of their pages during the series.

ITV decided to mute the contestants' social media accounts to increase their duty of care measures, after last series saw families call for action against trolls bombarding the accounts with awful messages.

As a result, the current crop of stars have not seen the numbers rack up on their social accounts.

Love Island star Casey O'Gorman has accused his ex-friend Will Young of ignoring messages after he called the TikTok farmer's girlfriend Jessie Wynter 'fake' in the South African villa

Love Island's Casey O'Gorman has spoken out about his feud with ex friend Will Young, making a brutal dig at his fellow reality star in a new interview.

The 26-year-old appeared on the 2023 winter version of the ITV dating reality series, but was dumped on Day 51 alongside Rosie after receiving the lowest number of public votes. Casey famously became close friends with Will in the South Africa villa, after the pair formed their 'Three Musketeers' clique with Tom Clare.

They fell out, however, after the the former recruitment manager questioned Will about the sincerity of his girlfriend, Jess Wynter.

""Me and Will are not as close anymore, he dropped us out I think,"" Casey told the Sun, before slamming the agricultural expert for speaking to the press instead of his friends. ""He's come out and done exclusives instead of texting us,"" Casey continued, adding that the TikTok farmer used his work as an excuse not to meet up.

The Trint native then accused Will of ghosting them, revealing that he and Tom have sent him ""about 10 messages"" inviting him to hang out but that he's ""ignored every one"" of them. Casey also questioned how intense Will's farming commitments really are, adding that he doesn't ""understand"" how ""he says he's busy on the farm but he's been on holiday probably about six months out of the nine months after coming out of Love Island.""

Their fallout dates back to Casey's condemnation of Jess Wynter as 'fake' on Love Island, after he accused her of 'playing games' and putting on an 'act' in her relationship. But when Will, 23, confronted his pal about his thoughts on the 26-year-old model, Casey changed his tune and insisted that he believed she was genuine. His contradictory statements were later exposed on Aftersun with Maya James, prompting Will to accuse his housemate of lying to him.

After months of no-contact, Casey appears to have no plans to reach out to the Buckinghamshire native. In fact, he has since revealed that he'd need an apology from Will for them to reconcile.

""If Will reached out to us and said 'I'm really sorry that I've been s*** for the last few months and not contacted you boys, it would be really nice to catch up and have a beer or it would be really nice to even go for a gym class together,"" Casey explained. ""If he doesn't want to go for a beer then we don't have to go for a beer, we can just stay in and play mini golf. But if he reached out to us then of course we would.""

WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES: A farm supplying chicken meat to British supermarkets Asda, Co-Op, Aldi and Tesco suffered severe injuries as a whistleblower claimed ""retailers are hiding the truth"" from the public

Chickens were ""crushed to death"" and ""run over"" by machinery on a farm which supplies British supermarkets, according to employees in the attached footage.

It is claimed that some of the birds suffer from severe injuries, and that one can be seen crawling on the floor with broken legs. Another lies gasping with an open wound exposing its internal organs, footage shows.

Employee Tom Herok gave his footage from the Lincolnshire farm, which supplies Two Sisters, to animal welfare organisation Open Cages. The chicken is sold in Asda, Aldi, Co-op and Tesco.

Two Sisters also supplied Lidl with what they say was a small amount fresh chicken but ended their contract ""sometime ago"". When asked by the Mirror they have refused to state when. Lidl told the Mirror the farm does not supply their supermarkets.

Tom claims working at the farm for three months last year was ""one of the worst experiences"" of his life, adding: ""These animals are suffering but retailers are hiding the truth.""

During his employment, Tom Herok claims he was warned he would see birds being ""˜run over"" with members of staff saying ""˜it's part of the job and can't really be avoided.'

Another scene from footage seen by the Mirror also appears to show workers collecting dozens of eviscerated birds inside the recently emptied barns. He claims staff later told him that they were ""˜run over' and killed by a forklift whilst being transported.

He also claims that workers told him that fast growing chickens - dubbed frankechickens, which are slaughtered at just six weeks old - suffer from ""broken legs'', ""heart attacks'', ""suffocation"", ""arthritis"", ""deformities'' and chemical burns from urine ""burning their feet all the time.' ""

Tom claims: ""There is widespread animal cruelty within the UK chicken industry and retailers are hiding that from us. On numerous farms supplying retailers I not only saw animals being carelessly crushed to death. I saw first hand the daily struggle of a Frankenchicken.

""It was my job to put thousands of them out of their misery.""

Open Cages is filing a criminal complaint against the farm for what it claims are multiple breaches of animal welfare laws and regulations.

TV Presenter and animal advocate Chris Packham said: ""I've never seen such disgraceful disregard for the welfare of chickens in all my life.""

90% of chickens reared in the UK are fast-growing breeds, aka frankenchickens. Connor Jackson, CEO and Co-founder of Open Cages said: ""Not only are these defenceless animals suffering from infections, broken bones and burns from laying in their own waste, they're in ever present danger of being carelessly run over and torn apart.""

He added: ""Lidl won't solve this by cutting ties with one farm. The only way for Lidl to address this problem is to sign the Better Chicken Commitment (BCC).""

The BCC prohibits the use of fast growing breeds and overcrowded conditions. Hundreds of companies have already pledged to meet these improved standards, including Lidl France, KFC, Greggs, Waitrose and Marks and Spencer.

Open Cages, along with 51 animal welfare experts, has signed an open letter to retailers urging them to sign up.

A Tesco spokesperson said: ""These allegations are incredibly serious and are clearly unacceptable. As soon as we became aware of them we contacted our supplier to carry out an investigation. We are monitoring the situation closely while this investigation takes place.""

Two Sisters said: ""We fully condemn any reports of animal welfare breaches and any violations of the high standards we expect all farm workers to uphold.

""We maintain a zero tolerance approach to any confirmed instances of welfare non-compliance, however isolated, and as we continue to investigate this matter.

""Our initial review of independent welfare and veterinary data for the period shown reveals the overwhelming majority of bird at this accredited farm are healthy and well-managed.

""Focusing on isolated examples using selectively-edited video footage often does not show the reality on the ground. In fact, all it does is paint a distorted and misrepresentative picture of the true high standards all farmers strive for every day, including at this location.

""All our farms operate to UK and EU legislation and are independently audited and accredited to Red Tractor standards as a minimum.""

Red Tractor said: ""The farm in question was subject to a regular independent inspection earlier this year and found to comply with our core standards. Nevertheless, we are concerned by the footage and have already started a new investigation to be sure that compliance on the farm continues.""

Asda said: ""We have comprehensive animal welfare policies in place which our suppliers must uphold, and our priority is to source from producers accredited to Red Tractor assured standards.""

A Co-op spokesperson added : ""Looking after the animals in our care is a priority for us and we are proud supporters of British Farming, allowing us to conveniently provide great quality, 100% British protein and we have immediately spoken to our supplier to understand more details about this footage"".

Aldi did not comment but on their behalf the British Retail Consortium's Andrew Opie, said: ""Retailers know how important animal welfare is to their customers and work closely with their British farmers to ensure all chicken is produced to high standards. Supermarkets are keen to deliver the best value for hard-pressed consumers, while offering a choice of how their chicken is produced, clearly labelling different farming methods.""

A spokesman for Lidl added: ""The farm and supplier in question does not supply Lidl. We take animal welfare extremely seriously and have long been committed to increasing welfare and traceability standards throughout our supply chain.""

Tim Saint, from Reading, is hoping to wow judges with his mega pumpkin at the Malvern Autumn Show this weekend - he has shared his secrets to growing the huge fruit

A 6ft farmer has shown off his jumbo-sized pumpkin which weighs almost 48 stone and is half his size in height.

Tim Saint, 42, and his mega fruit, from Reading, will be one of the star attractions at the Malvern Autumn Show in Worcestershire this weekend.

The talented gardener said he is ""delighted"" with how his squash has turned out and said it is so big it can only be moved with a forklift. He attached the 47.6st (667lbs) pumpkin into a trailer by using industrial straps and then hoisted it into place with a farm teleporter.

Speaking about his super-sized vegetable, he said: ""I've been growing pumpkins for 20 years and that's the biggest I've ever done. It's got to be over 3ft tall at least, I'm 6ft tall myself and it's big.

""The secret is just plenty of water and manure, plenty of cow manure especially. It takes a lot of water, I normally give it five watering cans of water a day. My best friend's got a trailer and we brought it down in that. We had to use a forklift to get it off. I had a 44lbs beetroot here too. I'll be doing this every year until I can't do it anymore.""

Thousands of gardening fans are expected to flock to the show to marvel at the gigantic greens. Ian Scott, 51, from Wells, Somerset, is hoping his 3.5st (22kg) cabbage will secure him a spot on the winner's podium this year. The dad-of-two, who works as a stone mason, said: ""At the moment I think I'm standing at first place. It's not even a record for me. It's 22kg and about four-and-a-half feet wide. It's not been a good year for cabbages, it was so hot at the beginning of the season. Then it was colder and wetter at the end of the season. My first show was in 1999. I've had one year off of cabbages, my soil is good for it.""

Eleven new Guinness World Records were set at last year's show, including the heaviest aubergine weighing 3.362kg and the longest leek at 1.432m long. Hoping to have claimed the giant cucumber record this year is Tom Bailey, 32, who says he's narrowly beaten last year's record by 600g. Tom, from Barry, South Wales, said: ""It's a 13.52kg cucumber, it was a bit of a surprise. It's my first year entering. It's a good seed and soil that make it. I've been using alpaca manure. That's helped it, and a bit of luck. It's my first competition. I've tried pumpkins before. But I got given some cucumber seeds and I thought I'd chuck them in. I've managed to grow a record. Mine's above average for this year, I think the previous record was 12.9kg.""

If you're in the Diablo 4 endgame and are seeking a good way to farm XP fast, this latest glitch should do the trick

Members of the community have been quick to find the most efficient ways to maximise Diablo 4 XP gain since the most recent patch.

Last week Activision Blizzard released what is likely to be the last major patch for Diablo 4 prior to the arrival of Diablo 4 Season 1 later on this month. Update 1.0.3 offered a myriad of changes that included loot changes and hotfixes to deal with persistent crashes. Also addressed, though, was a popular glitch that would see monsters infinitely respawn with Cellar Events. In the week since, the community has been hard at work seeking another way to better farm XP using glitch methods.

You may no longer be able to farm Diablo 4 XP using what came to be known as the ""˜infinite spawn' glitch since it has been patched. However, YouTuber Unlimited Glitch has detailed another method in a video on his YouTube channel which so far has gone unpatched, that not only lets you farm a good deal of Legendary level items quickly but large amounts of XP within a short space of time too.

It's worth mentioning that there's a very slim chance the more this Diablo 4 XP glitch catches on you could be at risk of having your Battle.net account banned. Someone would have to report you, of course, for this to happen, but please do so at your own risk.

All that's required is a Sigil and a particularly nifty use of the Teleport function. This glitch can also only be used by players who are in the endgame, since it requires you to be able to activate a Nightmare dungeon and withstand high-level enemies.

Diablo 4 XP glitch: how to farm XP fast

The Diablo 4 XP glitch in question has been dubbed the ""˜the instant dungeon restart' glitch by Unlimited Glitch, and revolves around a dungeon called The Hallowed Glacier located not too far out from the main city of Kyovashad. This isn't hard to find since it's the first big town area you come across. It's worth noting that this glitch isn't unique to this specific dungeon, per se, but makes the most sense due to its close proximity of where your Teleport portal will end up.

As a note, there is a side quest tied to The Hallowed Glacier Dungeon named Call of the Ancients. The XP and Legendary item farming will be more effective if you haven't completed this yet. Here's a step-by-step break down of how the instant dungeon restart Diablo 4 XP glitch works.

Presently, even after the recent 1.0.3 update, this is one of the fastest ways to farm Diablo 4 XP according to Unlimited Glitch, thanks to how the instant dungeon restart glitch works. It's only useable for players strong enough to withstand endgame level enemies and there's a chance it may be patched by Activision Blizzard in future. Until that time, however, it's estimated a solo player can acquire roughly half a million XP every two minutes.

Fiona the stranded sheep was stuck in the Highlands for two years after being spotted by a kayaker. Now, she was rescued by five brave farmers and will be taken to a Scottish farm park

A lonely sheep stranded on the foot of some cliffs in the Scottish Highlands for at least two years has finally been rescued by a group of farmers.

Dubbed ""Britain's loneliest sheep"", Fiona was first spotted by kayaker Jill Turner along the Moray Firth's east Highland coast two years ago, and then again this year. Since her rescue, it's been said she will be taken to a Scottish farm park.

The SSPCA said it was aware of the ewe's situation but initially decided not to attempt a rescue as it had plenty of food and water. However, a petition calling on the animal charity to take action which fetched over 55,000 signatures prompted a change in stance.

In the end, a group of five farmers managed to haul her up a steep slope to safety, and have since named her ""Fiona"". In a video on social media, Ali Williamson said he and his team used ""heavy equipment"" to get Fiona up an ""incredible slope"".

He added: ""She is incredibly fettle. The SSPCA are here, she's had a full check-over. She is about a condition score of about 4.5, she is over-fat - it was some job lifting her up that slope. She is going to a very special place that a lot of you know very well, where you'll be able to see her virtually every day.""

Earlier this week, the SSPCA said it would attempt to rescue Fiona, with the charity's chief superintendent Mike Flynn warning: ""The area where the sheep is stranded is very inaccessible by both land and sea, making this rescue incredibly complex, especially due to the logistics of rescuing a large animal.""

Responding to Saturday's successful rescue, an SSPCA spokesperson said: ""This morning the Scottish SPCA were in attendance at the hillside after they were made aware that a group of individuals with climbing expertise were attempting to rescue the stranded sheep by descending down to where she was trapped.

Do you refrigerate your eggs or keep them in the cupboard? Now there is a definitive answer on what you should do when it comes to storing these staple kitchen ingredients

They're a staple in every Brit's kitchen, whether you regularly have eggs on toast or love to bake cakes. But should you store your eggs in the fridge or in your cupboard? It's an ongoing debate for many. Some worry about the safety of using eggs stored at room temperature, while others swear that room temperature eggs are the best for cooking with.

Chances are though, you're storing your eggs completely wrong. According to price comparison sight idealo.co.uk, almost a third of people don't store their food correctly, which results in items going off faster than normal and getting wasted. One way to make sure your eggs last longer is storing them in the fridge. One egg farmer made it clear that ""fresh eggs store on shelf for four weeks, six weeks in the fridge"", which could stretch out your eggs to make them last a lot longer.

Perhaps, if you store them in the fridge, you typically keep your eggs in the door, however this doesn't protect the fragile produce. Instead, do as Anna Williams, Head Pastry Chef of award-winning restaurant Fallow, does and keep them on a middle fridge shelf close to the back in the cardboard they come in. ""This location in the fridge is best to keep the eggs at a constant temperature and the cardboard boxes provide the perfect level of protection, plus they will have the expiry date on them"", Anna explains.

Dr Stuart Farrimond agrees that storing your eggs in the fridge door is not the best place for them at all. He explains in The Science of Cooking that it can ruin the egg whites as they'll shake up, which can ruin them for when you actually want to use them. Instead, it's best to place them on a shelf in the fridge.

Some chefs like James Martin swear against refrigerating your eggs, as he made clear on This Morning when he explained that ""all eggs are porous"", meaning you should ""never put eggs in the fridge. They absorb all the flavours from the fridge"". However, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) states to ""store eggs in a cool, dry place, ideally in the fridge and keep them apart from other foods.""

They also add that you should ""make sure you rotate stock and use the oldest food first. This helps to prevent harmful bacteria spreading from raw foods to ready- to-eat food.""

Local police in the South American nation are said to have switched their focus to Katherine Paola Santos, the partner of Colin Armstrong, who was taken from his home by force on Saturday

Ecuadorian police are investigating claims made about the partner of a billionaire Brit kidnapped at the weekend suggesting all is not what it seems.

Local cops are said to have switched their focus to Katherine Paola Santos, partner of Colin Armstrong , former honorary consul of the United Kingdom in Guayaquil who was taken from his home with force on Saturday. Earlier a lawyer claimed Katherine's real name is Alberto Santos and had surgery to ""look more feminine"".

The ongoing investigation to locate Mr Armstrong is being handled by Ecuador National Police director Cesar Augusto Zapata along with a specialist anti-kidnap and extortion unit. In a tweet the force said: ""Following an apparent criminal act against a businessman in the early hours of this morning in Los Rios, specialist police units are carrying out operative and investigative work on the ground.""

British intelligence services are also said to be assisting the Ecuadorian-led investigation into the whereabouts of the missing expat. As well as founding and owning a large agricultural supply company in the South American country, he is a director along with his son of the 500-acre Tupgill Park Estate near Leyburn in North Yorkshire which has been the family home for more than 45 years.

Ecuador's National Police have so far made only one official comment on the kidnap, which happened around 2.45am local time on Saturday at the British businessman's ranch called Rancho Rodeo Grande. The ranch is located near the town of Baba in Los Rios province, two hours drive north of Guayaquil.

Mr Colin, as he was known affectionately by staff at the ranch, is understood to have been kidnapped in an operation involving more than 15 gangsters and forcibly bundled into a black BMW he owned with his partner which was later found abandoned near the scene.
Last night it was reported Nick Armstrong, Mr Armstrong's son who helps run the family estate in North Yorkshire, had flown to Ecuador to help police locate his father.

Mr Armstrong, who is thought to have previously been married to an Ecuadorian woman, has had a long association with the South America country. He founded Agripac in 1972. His adopted son Leo Morris helps run a restaurant at the family's Yorkshire estate. The estate now welcomes more than 150,000 visitors a year to an attraction known as the Forgotten Corner which was originally built as a private folly.

Footage showing the aftermath of the kidnap was posted online shortly after it happened. A woman thought to be a member of staff filming inside the ranch took close-up shots of broken plates on the floor and a man who appeared to be holding a bandage to his head.

She then walked into one of the bedrooms where there was blood over the bed and said as she focused in on the stained sheets: ""This is where they hit him. My God what is this!!!"" The unidentified woman appeared to be referring to the man she had previously filmed sitting on the stairs nursing what looked to be a head wound.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has not been seen in public for 35 days - the second longest period ever while he has been in power - ahead of a major military parade this week

Kim Jong-un has not been seen in public for 35 days, it is reported as North Korea prepares a military parade to mark its 75th anniversary.

The North Korean leader missed a third Politburo meeting on Sunday where top officials were discussing the country's major agricultural problems, according to state media.

While it is not unusual for Kim to go periods without being seen in public, 35 days is reportedly his second longest period ever.

And it comes as the army along with members of the public have been preparing in freezing temperatures for the parade this week, which could start on Tuesday night or Wednesday, with February 8 marking 75 years since the Korean People's Army was formed.

There is speculation that Kim has been keeping out of the limelight to prepare for what is expected to be a massive ceremony and it is based on the fact that last year he was seen micromanaging a military parade in April.

This is only the third time that Kim has missed Politburo meetings with the other two in June and September last year, reports NK News.

Rules were changed in January 2021 which allowed the Politburo meetings to still go ahead without Kim as long as he gave his authorisation.

His current absence from public view matches the 35 days at the end of 2021 and the only longer spell was 40 days in 2014.

Preparations for the 75th anniversary have included aircraft flying at low altitude over the capital Pyongyang.

Multiple jets, lit up and carrying flares, were seen heading in the direction of Kim ll Sung Square - suggesting that the parade might take at night.

The parades comes amid tensions riding high between North Korea and the US along with its western allies.

North Korea said last Thursday it was prepared to counter US military moves with the ""most overwhelming nuclear force"". it warned that the expansion of the United States' military exercises with rival South Korea is pushing tensions to an ""extreme red line.""

Kim could showcase his growing arsenal of nuclear-capable missiles at the military parade in Pyongyang.

Experts say Kim's nuclear push is aimed at forcing the United States to accept the idea of North Korea as a nuclear power so it can negotiate badly needed economic concessions from a position of strength.

Nuclear negotiations between the US and North Korea stopped in 2019 because of disagreements over a relaxation of US-led economic sanctions against the North in exchange for steps by North Korea to wind down its nuclear weapons and missiles programmes.

Breezy the one-year-old award-winning Bengal was getting on a Southwest Airlines flight with owner Ginger when she escaped her carried and bolted, falling through a gap in the bridge

A disabled veteran has been left desperately looking for her show cat who went missing after falling out of plane is it got ready to take off.

Owner Ginger Thompson and the feline Breezy had been in Denver participating in a show but when they were getting onto a plane to fly back to their home in Spokane, Washington, Breezy escaped and disappeared.

The one-year-old Bengal got out of her carrier when someone bumped into it as they were getting onto the plane at Denver International Airport. Ginger frantically tried to coax Breezy back but the cat spooked and ran out the open plane door and fell through the gap between the plane and the bridge.

A fundraiser setup to help support Ginger as she looks for Breezy reads: ""Lost and frightened, Breezy could be anywhere in the vicinity, possibly injured from a significant fall during her escape.""

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.

Ginger, a disabled military veteran, said: ""I'd do anything for my cat, and I'm so afraid she's hurt. I'm afraid they're not going to find her."" But after staying in the area for a few days to help look for Breezy she's facing having to fly home with her.

A spokesperson for the airport said U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services is helping look for the cat and is working with personnel from the airport. Ginger's search has got a lot of traction online and has been shared widely by animal lovers.

The owner/ cat pair had travelled to Denver for a cat show at the Crowne Plaza Denver International Convention Center, where Breezy won an award in 14 of 17 finals. ""Breezy is more then a show kitty,"" Ginger said on Facebook. ""She and my other two are what keeps me going.""

Members of Econo Cat Club in Denver, helped Ginger by getting her a hotel room for the night and helping put out the word.

""We're a cat family. We all love our animals. This is what we do,"" said member Kelly Condie.

The fundraiser reads: ""The funds we're raising will enable Ginger to remain in Denver a few days, to search for Breezy and provide her with the care and attention she undoubtedly needs when/if found. These funds will cover essential expenses like food and lodging during Ginger's stay, ensuring she can focus solely on reuniting with her beloved companion.""

Adam Bradford set up a betting safety app after his father was jailed for gambling debts - and has now taken his philanthropic efforts to central Africa

A young businessman who helped settle his father's £500,000 secret gambling debts and went on to reform the betting industry has now turned his sights to helping youngsters - in Rwanda.

Adam Bradford only learnt of his dad's addiction when he was told his father was going to prison, having been found guilty of stealing £50,000 from his bosses.

The then-21-year-old made it his mission to pay back every penny owed, before creating a betting safety app, BetProtect, to help prevent others enduring similar pain and suffering.

After selling the app to international gambling body, Crucial Compliance, he made it his life's work to help youngsters become successful business owners just like him.

And having supported countless people in the UK, he's now working with budding entrepreneurs 6,000-plus miles away in Rwanda.

Adam, who was diagnosed with autism aged 11, said: ""Last year, we sold BetProtect to one of the biggest gaming consultancies who work with the big gambling operators.

""When you're playing online, Crucial's software actually detects when you're spending a bit more than usual, using AI and algorithms - if it's late at night, whether you're playing in a strange pattern, things like that.

""Then it helps the company look at how to deal with the customer to keep them safe. It's all about preventing the addiction from taking over somebody in that state of mind.""

Now, Adam's turning his philanthropic nature to those halfway around the world - in a land-locked country in central Africa.

He said: ""I have a Queen's Young Leaders Award, which is a Commonwealth award for young people who have displayed leadership and doing things in their community.

""Through there, I went to a Commonwealth meeting in Kigali, which is the capital of Rwanda, last June.

""I met up with an old friend called Emmanuel Nshimiyimana who's based there, with a charity called Rwanda Opportunities Organization.

""It supports young people from rural communities with things like literacy and reading and writing skills, and they also do entrepreneurship and ICT work as well.

""I was just fascinated by what the country's doing, because we've always had an eye for giving opportunities, supporting the next generation, wanting to mentor and give back.

""And then something just struck a chord - I'd made my decision within 48 hours.""

Adam also thinks the general public's view of Rwanda is old-fashioned, and the country has a bright future, both in agriculture - and the technology sector.

He said: ""I think the people are some of the friendliest people in the whole world, and I've travelled a lot - they are very kind, they're friendly, they would do anything for you.

""I hate the adverts that are on the TV that are like please give £2 to get a child water, and everyone's crying.

""And I think yes, there are parts of Africa that are very poor, there are parts of every country that are very poor where people live in poverty, but this just changed my whole perception.

""Primarily, it's agriculture - it's farming, it's fruit and veg, food, that kind of stuff. The land is very fertile, it's a very green country.

""Secondly, they're building themselves up as a tech hub, so there's lots of coding academies and business incubators and projects that are starting, and we're getting involved in a few of them ourselves as well.""

As for life in Africa, Adam's found swapping the hills of Sheffield for the mountains of Rwanda interesting, to say the least.

He said: ""Lions and monkeys in the back garden isn't a million miles from the truth. I live behind a volcano which is in one of the reserves. It's one of the old ones.

""There's gorillas in there, so I'm pretty sure if you walked a few hundred meters behind my house you might find them.""

And Adam's success story looks set to continue - in Hollywood.

The entrepreneur is currently a consulting producer for a new movie which focusses on autism. Details are under wraps at the moment, but the film stars an A-lister and should be released later this year.

A mum in Wisconsin is asking for national changes to toy safety regulations after her 10-month-old daughter Esther Jo Bethard died choking on an object the family wasn't aware of

A girl just 10-months-old has died after swallowing a water bead - and her mum is calling for national changes.

After the death of her daughter, a mum began speaking out about a common kid's toy that is commonly marketed towards babies and autistic children that has no warnings.

When Esther Jo Bethard died in July choking on a water bead, just months short of her first birthday, her family had no idea what had happened. She became ill the day before, with her parents rushing her to medical care.

It turned out that water beads, marketed as a colourful sensory toy, swell to many times their size when they come in contact with liquid, and when they are dry, they're about the size of a pinhead.

Water beads were used as ""agricultural products intended to maintain soil moisture,"" according to Poison.org, a website that tracks hazardous products. They've been utilised by florists to keep their arrangements hydrated and are contained within products like diapers for their fluid absorbency.

When a water bead is swallowed, it begins to grow larger as it travels through your body, eventually causing an intestinal blockage. The symptoms this causes ""are the same as having a stomach bug,"" said Taylor Bethard. Children who have come into contact with this item and suddenly begin experiencing vomiting, abdominal pain and constipation, among other things, should immediately seek medical care, says the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Since her child's death, mum Taylor Bethard has been speaking out publicly against having water beads as toys and has found some local success. ""Water beads should be banned/recalled and no longer allowed to be marketed as a children's toy,"" Bethard said.

Berthard is a teacher and was not aware of the risks, as the toys don't come with any hazard notices or other warnings. Had there been, she would have ""never would've allowed my older kids to play with them,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""They would've never been in my house.""

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.

She added, ""At the minimum, water beads need to have the appropriate warnings about the life-threatening dangers, which is not limited to choking."" In December of last year, a few stores began removing them from shelves. Target stopped selling water beads after a California infant accidentally swallowed one and died. Other large chains like Amazon are still selling them.

Medical professionals began warning parents about water beads years ago, but it hasn't gained national attention, which is what Berthard is looking for. ""We have seen children in our emergency room who have swallowed water beads, which can lead to intestinal blockages and can be life-threatening,"" said UC Davis pediatric trauma surgeon Minna Minsing Wieck. ""We want to urge the public not to purchase these products, particularly for small children who may accidentally swallow them.""

Healthychildren.org also suggests there have been cases where children have shoved water beads into their ears, not knowing the dangers. ""Two CPSC reports, children were treated for ear infections when doctors couldn't spot clear beads in their ears during an exam.""

""The delay in finding the beads allowed them to grow until the kids, who were 5 and 7 years old, needed surgery. Both have ear drum damage and one hearing loss,"" says the site.

They also say that while water beads are recommended for children over three years old, younger siblings often find them before their parents notice. The Consumer Public Safety Commission says they are aware of Esther Jo Bethard's tragic death and are looking into the incident.

They further state: ""We have been working with industry to improve the relevant standards for these products and are considering additional rulemaking options should they not do so in a timely manner. We strongly encourage parents and caregivers to report any incidents with this product to us at SaferProducts.gov.""

""After hearing about Esther, many of our local teachers, principals and therapists got rid of them,"" said mom Bethard. ""I then chose to reach out to the superintendent because I wanted them to be gone in all of our schools. I wanted it to be a rule that they weren't allowed."" She added, ""Thankfully, our school district has decided that water beads will not be allowed.""

Berhard also said, ""We are blessed by wonderful friends, family and support from our church. Suddenly losing your child is every parent's worst nightmare. We have four other kids. Without support from people around us, there's no way my husband and I could support our four other kids through this loss.""

The mum says that her daughter Esther was a bright and mischievous child who loved smiling and dancing. ""She was absolutely adored by every single one of her big siblings,"" Taylor Bethard told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""She had a big smile that brightened up the whole room, beautiful blue eyes and curly red hair.""

Mum recalls that Esther learned to pull herself up and climb on the couches and the stairs much easier than any of her siblings. ""She knew she wasn't supposed to climb the stairs. So she would start to climb them, stop to look at you, smile and scurry away as fast as she could when you went to get her.""

Berhard concluded with advice to other parents on water beads: ""They bounce, they roll, they get lost in carpets and corners of the house,"" she said. ""The risk is not worth it. If you want your kids to enjoy the sensory aspect ""” there are alternatives.""

If you discover that your child has swallowed water beads, call poison control immediately at 800-222-1222 and take the child to the emergency room right away.

Wildfires ripping through Algeria have killed 25 people including 10 soldiers trying to control it while thousands of people are being evacuated from areas affected

Wildfires raging across Algeria have killed 25 people, including 10 soldiers trying to get the flames under control in the face of high winds and scorching summer temperatures.

At least 1,500 people were evacuated, the Interior Ministry said on Monday.

It comes after fires have ripped through parts of southern Europe due to an unprecedented heatwave where temperatures have hit the middle to high 40Cs.

The Interior Ministry announced 15 deaths and 24 injuries. In addition, the Defense Ministry later announced 10 soldiers were killed and 25 injured as they fought fires in the resort area of Beni Ksila east of the capital Algiers.

It wasn't immediately clear over what period of time the casualties happened but the fires have been burning for several days.

Wildfires, some spread by strong winds, moved across forests and agricultural areas in 16 regions causing 97 blazes in the north African country.

The largest and deadliest fires ravaged parts of Bejaia and Jijel - in the Kabyle region east of Algiers - and Bouira, about 60 miles southeast of Algiers, the Interior Ministry said.

Operations to tamp down the fires included some 7,500 firefighters and 350 trucks on the ground as well as air support.

Algeria is no stranger to summer wildfires.. At least 37 people were killed last August after wildfires blazed near Algeria's northern border with Tunisia.

A year earlier, authorities said dozens were killed in blazes - including soldiers called in to help fight the fires in the mountainous Kabyle region that is dotted with villages.

Strong winds and successive heat waves have fueled vicious fires in Greece and elsewhere around the Mediterranean this summer.

Fires caused devastation on the Spanish island of Tenerife and now large areas of the island of Rhodes in Greece is ablaze leading to thousands of evacuations.

As Brits rush to escape the holiday island of Rhodes, emergency services fear more blazes could hit other Greek islands - including Crete.

Corfu was the second island to be hit by the horrific wildfires at the weekend, and the fire service are preparing for the fires to spread.

The Corfu blaze prompted warnings to Brits staying at certain hotels not to travel. Locals in some areas battled the blaze themselves on Corfu as sea evacuations were carried out.

Now Crete has been issued with an extreme risk warning for fires as temperatures are forecast to surge to 41C tomorrow. The Greek government has put the fire alert in place from Tuesday, which also covers Attica, Central Greece, Peloponnese region and the South Aegean region.

Fraudster Alan Yeomans hid half of a six-bedroom mansion in Derbyshire, concealing it as a farm shed, where he kept antiques, oil paintings, and a £10,000 Rolex watch

A fraudster disguised a £1.2million mansion to look like a farm shed where he kept antiques, oil paintings, and a £10,000 Rolex watch.

The property that belonged to Alan Yeomans, 67, in Derbyshire, is now having green cladding, so it couldn't be seen from the road, removed by new owners with planning permission granted.

Half of the six-bedroom Shedley Manor was concealed so it looked like a farm shed by Yeomans, who declared himself bankrupt.

He told officials he was living in a shed in his mother's garden and had just £300-worth of furniture and a £30 watch to his name.

But police raided the property following a tip-off and discovered an Aladdin's cave, including a £10,000 Rolex watch and antiques and oil paintings worth £83,250.

You'll certainly turn heads in this figure-hugging crochet maxi. The dress is similar to Maya's designer find, boasting deep side cut-outs and an open low back design, however this one has a plunging neckline that'll certainly get hearts racing by the pool.

If you're not into side cut-outs, this maxi dress is the one for you. Boasting crochet detailing, a sexy open back which ties at the top and a deep leg slit, it's the perfect dress to throw on over your bikini, or dress it up, and wear it out for dinner on holiday to wow your friends/other half.

When it comes to dupes of Maya Jama's dress, this one definitely takes first spot. Although it's not crochet, it features semi-sheer lace fabric with cut-out detailing throughout. Brides-to-be, this is a must-have for your wardrobe - especially as it's on sale right now.

If mini dresses are more your style, this stunning crochet number from Nasty Gal is ideal for those hot days on the beach, or dress it up with cowboy boots for the ultimate chic festival look.

Last but not least is this stunning knitted beach dress that's great for throwing over the top of a bikini on holiday. It boasts ring and cut-out detailing, an open back and a cheeky leg slit.

Officers also found designer shoes and cannabis plants which were stashed in a secret room behind an oil painting of Elizabethan statesman Robert Cecil.

An outbuilding at the property in Yeaveley, near Ashbourne, was also used as a cannabis factory.

Yeomans admitted a string of offences including fraud, money laundering and producing cannabis, and was jailed for six-and-a-half years in 2016.

The property was auctioned and initially earmarked for demolition but was then re-sold.

The current owners have now been given planning permission by Derbyshire Dales District Council to renovate it.

They have been granted permission to remove the green cladding, put windows in rooms that had none and create a new entrance.

Architect Matthew Montague said: ""This property has quite a history. It was built to look, from the outside, like a non-descript corrugated green agricultural barn but it was far from that and in reality there was luxury hidden within.

""Quite a considerable amount of work is now needed, both inside and out, to make it into a house but permission has been granted so the owners can get on with it. It will look very, very different.""

Yeomans was jailed after pleading guilty to nine charges relating to the production and supply of cannabis, stealing electricity, concealing criminal property and failing to disclose bankruptcy.

Derby Crown Court heard he had built the manor in 2002 in his mother's back garden, without planning permission, and with green cladding to disguise it as a large shed.

When he was jailed, Judge Nirmal Shant branded Yeomans ""a liar, a money launderer, and someone involved in the production of drugs"".

Glenn Wicks, of the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, said: ""What surprised me when I went into Shedley Manor was that someone built a six-bedroom manor house in the Peak District and filled it with fine art and antiques and the authorities didn't know anything about it.

""This was a very intricate, sophisticated set-up.""

A derelict 16-bedroom mansion in Cambridgeshire, which has been the victim of multiple serious fires in the past 100 years, has been put on the market and up for auction

An abandoned Edwardian mansion which has been described as the ""ultimate fixer-upper"" has been put on the market.

Next month, an empty and disused property found on the outskirts of Longstanton, Cambridgeshire, is going to auction and the lucky winner bidder will be left with a huge challenge to get it back in shape.

Redlands was built in 1905 and hasn't been occupied since the 1950s when it was used for agricultural storage before later falling derelict after multiple fires.

Despite some damage, the core of the building still remains but has been overwhelmed by greenery. The property sits in more than an acre of overgrown jungle-like gardens.

Pictures of the property show what the 16-room mansion looks like and offers an insight into the marvellous building it once was in its heyday.

There is an imposing entrance with stone steps, a large reception space with mosaic flooring, fireplaces, a cellar, eight bedrooms, and servants' quarters. It had a balcony along the length of the first floor, a tennis lawn, and an orchard.

A major fire tore through the property in 1956 as a result of a suspected electric heater fire ravaged the interior and a large part of the roof, CambridgeshireLive reports.

It is currently owned by Keith Tyker, who had it passed down to him by his father who bought the site in 1959 for £900, and will be auctioned off by Cheffins Auctioneers.

Mr Tyler said: ""I really hope that someone falls in love with the romance of Redlands. It really is time for someone to take it on and bring it back to its former glory.""

The house suffered two more fires, the worst in 1996 which destroyed all the internal floors, and most of the rooms, as well as what had remained of the original roof.

Redlands was removed from the rating list in 1996, following the extensive fire damage, and mains electricity, gas and water connections have been capped off.

The property will be sold in Cambridge on September 27 with a guide price of £100,000-£120,000. There is an additional two acres of land, adjacent to Redlands, which will be offered at the same auction with a pre-sale estimate of £50,000-£60,000.

A combination of bad weather and transport problems in Africa and Europe has seen UK supermarket shelves left bare of tomatoes, as well as dwindling stocks of some other fresh produce

Fruit and vegetables are being rationed by some supermarkets as shortages caused by poor weather in southern Spain and north Africa lead to empty shelves in fresh food aisles.

Asda has a limit of three items each on packs of tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflower and raspberries.

Morrisons is introducing limits of two for tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and peppers.

Tesco and Sainsbury's said they were not putting limits on fresh produce, but shoppers have posted pictures on social media of empty shelves.

Andrew Opie, of the British Retail Consortium, said: ""Difficult weather conditions in the south of Europe and northern Africa have disrupted harvest for some fruit and vegetables.

""However, supermarkets are adept at managing supply chain issues and are working with farmers to ensure that customers are able to access a wide range of fresh produce.""

But the President of the National Farmers' Union Minette Batters warned home-grown produce could be limited as growers were reeling from soaring energy bills and inflation.

Farmers have also been struggling with staff shortages due to Brexit and changes to support payments to replace those from the EU.

As the NFU began its annual conference in Birmingham, Ms Batters said: ""Everybody wants to avoid rationing. But I think there are going to be challenges on availability of some food.""

As shelves continue to be stripped bare in fresh food aisles across the UK, here is everything we know so far.

What is causing the shortages?

A host of issues, all coming together at the same time, though weather is a big factor.

Much of our fresh produce, including tomatoes, salad and certain vegetables, come from southern Europe and north Africa at this time of the year.

But extreme weather has hit crops.

Morocco, for example, has had to contend with frost, heavy rain, and flooding.

To make matters worse, exports have been hampered by cancelled ferries over the past three to four weeks.

Spanish crops have also been hit by poor weather in the past month.

The Fresh Produce Journal summed it up as a ""perfect storm"" .

Aside from the weather, what other issues are there?

Another major one is the cost of energy.

Producers have reported having to cut back on their use of greenhouses due to higher electricity prices.

Is Brexit a factor?

The NFU certainly believes that a cut in post-Brexit farm subsides is one reason why production of some fresh produce here, as well as eggs, has reduced.

When it comes to imports, it is less clear.

Are shortages widespread?

There have certainly been pictures posted online of empty shelves, but it is far from the case everywhere.

Tesco and Sainsbury's both said they had no limits on purchases.

And even three bags of, say, tomatoes or peppers in one shop is quite a lot for most households.

The risk is that there could be panic buying, which makes the situation worse.

How long will it last?

The British Retail Consortium expects the disruption to ""last a few weeks.""

UK producers are beginning to move into their growing season, which is expected to ease the longer term situation as retailers also look to alternatives to produce from Spain and northern Africa.

What about tinned and frozen vegetables?

That is certainly one alternative option for shoppers, although increased demand could push up prices.

Many of the staff involved in the illegal 'clinics' are untrained, but somehow still manage to 'dupe' members of the public into thinking their dogs are in safe hands

Fake 'vets' at canine fertility 'clinics' are raking in huge profits after carrying out dangerous procedures including IVF to create designer dog breeds.

Illegal canine fertility 'clinics' are responsible for the huge increase in the numbers of venues carrying out involuntary insemination on dogs in the UK. Shocking new evidence found that there are at least 332 dog fertility clinics operating in the UK, compared to the 37 known clinics found by an investigation just three years earlier in 2020.

Sarah Carr, chief executive of the Naturewatch Foundation, which uncovered the data, is calling for tough new laws across the whole of the UK to clamp down on the problem. She said: ""In terms of canine fertility clinics where they are lay people, the maximum fine for conviction is £100. There's no incentive not to do it if you think about a clinic whose performing caesarean sections and how much money they're bringing in.""

She told BelfastLive that the clinics are associated with ""designer trends"", with competition between them to breed the most ""different traits"" - for which they can charge a huge amount of money.

She added that many of the staff involved are untrained, but somehow still manage to 'dupe' members of the public into thinking their dogs are in safe hands. Currently in the UK, anyone can set themselves up as a 'canine fertility clinic' without any type of regulations.

Canine fertility clinics offer a range of dog fertility and breeding services, from artificial insemination and ultrasound scanning to progesterone testing and semen extraction. While some non-invasive procedures can be carried out by unqualified people, all forms of artificial insemination and invasive acts involving intravenous blood sampling must only be carried out by a vet by law.

And the spike in fertility clinics can be linked to the pandemic puppy boom and the demand for designer dog breeds that shows no sign of lessening. The British Veterinary Association is also deeply concerned that many canine fertility clinics are being run without a vet's oversight, with unqualified people carrying out veterinary procedures.

BVA senior vice president Justine Shotton, said: ""Figures from our latest survey are a stark reflection on our vets' concerns around the boom in canine fertility clinics across the country. It is no coincidence that their rise over the past few years can be linked to unscrupulous individuals cashing in on the huge demand for certain fashionable puppy breeds, like French bulldogs and other flat-faced breeds, who can struggle to mate or give birth naturally and can suffer from a range of health problems.

""Rather than listen to sound veterinary advice around responsible breeding, these individuals are taking matters into their own hands, fuelling a potential animal welfare disaster. Anyone looking to breed their dog should always speak to their vet first. That's because unsuspecting owners and breeders may not be aware that many canine fertility clinics are being run by people offering veterinary services without any qualifications.""

Dr Shotton added that the numbers should serve as a 'wake up call' for urgent action after it was revealed that hundreds of fertility clinics are popping up all over the country with 'no veterinary oversight'. Clinics tend to focus on the most in-demand breeds such as French bulldogs, which can struggle to mate and whelp naturally.

The BVA is particularly concerned about artificial insemination being used in such cases, as well as in cases where dogs with inherited diseases and conformation-related issues are used for breeding. It has also been made aware of worrying reports that some fertility clinics are advertising prohibited or dangerous procedures such as surgical artificial insemination.""

Vets responding to BVA's survey emphasised the need for stronger regulation of canine fertility clinics. Many vets also said that clinics should be inspected and given tough penalties if found to be operating outside the law.

Matt Jordan, Gardening Expert for The Greenhouse People, spoke to Express US on his top tips for deterring cats and foxes from fouling in gardens

Families often get frustrated when they find that a cat or fox has left its mess all over their garden. It can feel personal when an animal invades your lovely garden and leaves a nasty surprise.

Matt Jordan, a gardening expert for The Greenhouse People, shared his top tips with Express US on how to keep cats and foxes from messing in gardens. His advice is cheap, simple, and easy to follow.

He warned: ""Much to the dismay of their owners, many pets will eat their own poo and other animal faeces. However, this is a very dangerous habit for your pet animal poo can host a variety of diseases and parasites. One of the deadliest for dogs is parvovirus which is highly contagious and often fatal in unvaccinated dogs.""

He added: ""Not only is poo dangerous to pets, but can also harm humans. Cat stool poses a very serious threat to both humans and other cats alike and should never be left to fester in the garden.""

""Toxoplasmosis is an infection which infected cats can pass on to humans through their faeces and is particularly dangerous for those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems. .""

Keep it tidy

Cats and foxes like places to hide - so overgrown areas can make them feel secure and more likely to linger to do their business. Matt said: ""Foxes love overgrown areas, so keeping your garden neat and tidy is a sure and effective way to help deter foxes from doing their business in your backyard.""

""Focus on keeping your grass trimmed short, cutting back any overgrown bushes or shrubbery and keeping planting schemes tightly packed to avoid attracting foxes to den in your garden overnight and encouraging cats to come and dig in your garden.""

But bear in mind that overgrown areas are also sanctuaries for lots of other wildlife, such as hedgehogs, while allowing wildflowers to grow will also help pollinators.

Make your own DIY repellent

Foxes have a very strong sense of smell and will eat almost anything. Gardens with chickens or rabbits, or bird food, accessible bins, and crops will be particularly appealing. Matt said: ""Pests like foxes use scents to mark their territory to return to at a later date, which unfortunately for your garden means it'll become that fox's personal toilet.""

""Spraying a vinegar mixture over your plants and lawn will help rid your garden of any marking scents and stop them from returning. You can also try adding scents foxes don't like, such as garlic or chilli peppers. To repel cats, try citrus smells or herbaceous fragrances such as lavender, rosemary and peppermint.""

Invest in motion-sensor deterrents

As mentioned above, foxes and cats like to feel safe, so a motion sensor light or even sprinklers can be used to deter foxes. Matt explained: ""Foxes and cats are more likely to move on from gardens where they don't feel secure, so sudden lights, noises and sensations should scare off unwanted guests and prevent your garden from becoming a public toilet.""

""Motion-activated lights are not only a good investment for your home's safety, but they also conveniently keep foxes, cats and other pests at bay without bringing animals to harm.""

Remove food sources

To avoid cats and foxes looking for food Matt said: ""You'll need to remove bird feeders and make sure your bins are secure. A sudden surge in cat and fox droppings could even be a sign that mice have found their way into your garden and are attracting predators. Double-check that your compost pile hasn't become a rodent nest and that there aren't any food scraps attracting vermin.""

Introduce uncomfortable textures

This tip works for foxes but is mainly effective for deterring cats in particular, as they are ""very sensitive to strange-feeling textures"", so gardeners can easily deter them by being mindful of the type of materials being used in gardens, explained Matt.

He said: ""For example, try spreading larger mulch chunks or rocks across flower beds to keep cats away. You can also lay some thin chicken wire over the surface of your soil for a safe way to make your garden uncomfortable to step on.""

""Be wary that if you have stony areas in your garden, avoid using too fine a gravel which could be misinterpreted as a large litter tray for cats. You should avoid using any spikes or dangerous materials that could bring harm to your neighbouring felines and foxes.""

354,"UK 'ghost island' has been abandoned for 93 years after locals fled to mainland","https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/uk-ireland/uk-ghost-island-been-abandoned-31351433","UK 'ghost island' has been abandoned for 93 years after locals fled to mainland

St Kilda in the Outer Hebrides is the most remote British island and had a population for thousands of years until 1930s, when the locals were evacuated to the mainland

A village remains intact but eerily empty 93 years after inhabitants of a tiny British island far off the mainland fled the rocky outcrop.

For millennia a small group of hardy people withstood the ferocious wind, dark winters and freezing sea mist that ravage the Scottish island of St Kilda. Archaeologists believe that a group of people, never greater than 180, populated the island for thousands of years, right up until 1930.

Over the last 93 years it has remained empty and incredibly difficult to access. Those wanting to make the 40mile trip from the closest Hebridean island is being a chartered boat which can cost several hundred pounds per person. The only way to stay on the deserted rock is at a single campsite on the main island of Hirta. Those that do have to be prepared as the closest shop is on the Isle of Lewes, and there's no mobile signal or wifi.

If you go alone, it's likely your only company will be a remarkable flock of Soay sheep, left to almost completely their own devices since being dumped there in the 1930s, aside from the occasional scientists coming to marvel at their hardiness and independence.

Walking through the remains of the small village today one can imagine the people who used to live there, prior to their evacuation in 1930. At the end just 36 remained - 13 men, 10 women, eight girls and five boys. Their small number meant six of the 16 cottages on St Kilda remained empty.

Prior to the remote community's collapse in the late Victorian age, St Kildans had led a unique and fascinating existence. Gales that blew for 75 days a year and whipped up waves to 16m meant that few made the days-long crossing via boat from the other Hebridean islands or the mainland. As a result the community was sheltered from the goings on of Scotland and the rest of the UK.

Because the seas are so rough, locals avoided fishing, instead eating sheep and sheep's milk cheese, a few hardy crops and gannet, fulmar and puffins that live on the island's cliffs. Men would scale the rocky wall - the tallest sea cliff in the UK - to catch the birds and take their eggs. Oil from the birds powered their lamps and a freshwater spring provided water.

Another important aspect of St Kildan life was the daily ""parliament"". Each morning the men of St Kilda would meet to pray and then discuss what would happen that day, with no man leading and all having the right to speak. The same wasn't true of the island's women.

When the St Kildans needed to contact the mainland, they'd fashion a piece of wood into the shape of a boat, attach a sheepskin bladder to it to keep the vessel afloat, and leave a small message on it in a bottle. When the wind came from the North West, two thirds of their unmanned post-ships made it to Norway or the Western Isles. They remained incredibly isolated.

Chasing up rumours that Bonnie Prince Charlie had fled to St Kilda following the Battle of Culloden, British Red Coats arrived on the island to discover the main village empty, the locals having fled to the caves fearing pirates. When the two groups met, the Brits were surprised to discover they had no knowledge of the Scottish Uprising, or who King George II was.

The remote, incredibly isolated community had been living relatively free from disturbance for thousands of years before the Victorian era began. Buoyed by the ability to travel further and explore more than ever before - due to advances in shipping and the steam train - intrepid tourists began making their way to St Kilda.

At first the stream of tourists was a trickle. The first steamship to anchor in Village Bay was the 'Glenalbyn' in 1834, causing 'excitement and astonishment' among the islanders. Three decades later folklorist Alexander Carmichael arrived to learn traditional songs and, as he wrote, to ""kiss a St Kilda lassie"".

Come the 1870s and steam ships had started incorporating St Kilda into its trips around the Islands. Vessels passing would blow their whistles or fire a canon to startle the gannets, allowing passengers to enjoy an ornithological show. The island's human population wasn't treated much better.

Locals - whose happy existences were a surprise to visitors expecting to be confronted by lives of squalor - were treated as exotic curiosities. Flocks of tourists would come and watch them in their daily routines, fascinated by their unusual ways of survival.

With the visitors first came diseases that devastated the population and news of the outside world. The once almost completely cut off population began to learn of life on the mainland, tempting some to leave. And then more followed.

By the late 1920s life on St Kilda had become almost impossible, so many of the previous population having left their traditional livelihoods of raising sheep for wool, spinning and weaving tweed, fishing, and the harvesting of seabird eggs and oil. It became much harder to sustain.

After the harsh winter of 1929-30 many of the islanders felt that they could not continue on St Kilda much longer. A petition signed by 20 of the 36 residents asked the UK Government to evacuate them. All were taken off by the Scottish Office, with officials finding forestry work for the men, mostly close to Lochaline near Oban. Some families were sent to live near Strome Ferry, Rossshire, Culcabock near Inverness, and at Culross, Fife.

Now, 93 years after they left, the remains of their homes have been kept standing. A small team of volunteers occasionally arrive on St Kilda, to help the buildings withstand the wind and the rain, and to slow their inevitable total crumble into the hillside.

Several companies offer boat trips to St Kilda today, which is now a protect World Heritage Site, including Go To St Kilda.

I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! kicks off next month on ITV with bosses under pressure to make the show as dramatic as the last series starring disgraced MP Matt Hancock, Jill Scott and Chris Moyles

The upcoming series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! has been hit by a last minute glitch weeks before the launch - with a huge star being asked to fly to Australia at the 11th hour to complete the line-up.

Promotion for the upcoming series has already begun with Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly readying themselves to jet off within days to start filming. Anticipation has already been building, with ITV viewers spotting 'Jungle Retreat' adverts cropping up on the television to plug the 2023 series. However, it appears bosses are scrabbling behind the scenes to get the contestant line-up in check, as it has emerged a star has become a recent drop out.

Speaking on This Morning today, Gyles Brandreth let slip he has been contacted by I'm A Celeb bosses this week asking him to pack his bags. The Gogglebox star, 75, said he had flatly refused the offer, but admitted he thought producers must be 'desperate' as it had been so last minute.

He revealed: ""I was asked again this year. What is interesting is that they're obviously talking to people very last minute because I was asked again only this week. So maybe somebody dropped out and they were desperate. They drop you in and you walk a long that little bridge.""

However, at 75 Gyles wouldn't have been the oldest contestant that bosses have asked to appear on the show, as Arlene Philips was also asked - at the age of 78. The former Strictly Come Dancing judge starred in the 2021 series of the show that was relocated to Wales in the Covid pandemic.

Gyles' fellow This Morning star Josie Gibson has also been rumoured to be on the upcoming series. It was reported she'd been banned from appearing on Strictly Come Dancing this year after being asked to free her up to star on ITV's reality series.

Other names linked to the show include Olivia Attwood - who was forced to pull out of the show last year - and former Prime Minister Liz Truss. Bosses are hoping for more fireworks in the jungle after Matt Hancock stole headlines last year as viewers were outraged by his appearance. The new series is now just weeks away with viewers going into meltdown last weekend over the first release of a ten second trailer of the new series.

A voiceover said: ""Come away with us. Far, far away. The Jungle Retreat awaits"" before the unmistakeable chimes of the I'm A Celeb music could be heard playing in the background. Ant and Dec also looked eager to get back to Australia as they both shared the advert to their social media pages. The reality show will be back in November this year, with a new line-up yet to be officially revealed. Each year, viewers tune in to the exciting series as a new batch of celebrity campmates face their worst nightmares in the Australian jungle, including being voted by the public to do a notorious Bushtucker trial.

The show sees celebrities endure tough challenges that can sometimes include frightening insects part. Some of the challenges include eating animal body parts in a bid to have a luxurious meal. Without successfully completing a task, losers return to camp empty-handed and have to survive on rice and beans along with their campmates.

Anna Maria Island on Florida's Gulf Coast boasts funky hotels, fab food and amazing wildlife - you'll want to kick off your flip-flops and sink your feet into silky white sand

There are 32 steps from our apartment on the Gulf of Mexico to nature's most luxurious thick pile carpet. Kick off the flip-flops and let your feet sink into silky soft sand that makes anyone want to walk for miles and miles as far as the eye can see.

This shimmering shoreline on Anna Maria Island in Florida stretches from the north at Bean Point, evoking thoughts of Robinson Crusoe castaway paradise, to the magnificent nature reserve of Coquina Beach in the south.

We are staying at the Mainsail Beach Inn on Holmes Beach where children play in shallow warm water and stand on the nearest sandbar to see stingrays, sea trout and redfish swim past in deeper channels.

Foil surfers fly a couple of feet above the waves. Never heard of it? We're in the same club. The latest ocean excitement gets its name from the hydrofoil attached below the board.

Squadrons of pelicans glide above the azure waters looking for fish. Suddenly one peels off, soars a little higher and dives for dinner. At the water's edge, sandpipers chip away for food with long probing beaks, dancing elegantly backwards and forwards with the rolling waves.

Most captivating of all are the turtles shuffling from one dune to another to rest out of sight. It's turtle season so dozens of them are laying thousands of eggs.

Ed Chiles is a leading force in preserving these extraordinarily natural surroundings. He's all about sustainability and his staff are eco-conscious at his restaurants The Sandbar and the Beach House on Anna Maria and Mar Vista across the bridge on Longboat Key. We are sitting at the water's edge under centuries-old buttonwood trees at Mar Vista while discussing how vital it is to respect and look after the environment.

Ed sends bins full of leftover food to his nearby Gamble Creek farm where Zach and his wife Natasha - as passionate as Ed about entirely natural products - turn the waste into fertiliser for crops of vegetables, edible flowers, papaya, bananas and much more organic produce.

For years the restaurants threw away grouper collars (the neck of the fish) but Ed stopped that and has these fishy bits deep fried. They are mouthwateringly good. Clams are served up in a delicious sauce of wild boar, fennel and cream. But, Ed explains, clams are not just being farmed locally for the dinner plate. Clams and oysters form filtration systems to clean water to support seagrasses for fish and manatees.

Our two-bedroom apartment in Mainsail is very comfortable in one of its elegant, pale yellow clapboard buildings
where Matt, Rhoda and John make every guest feel at home. Many people tell me they've been coming to the island annually for 10, 20 and even 30 years.

A young man told me how his mother, a nurse, fell in love so much with Manatee County she travelled here when she was seven months pregnant to give birth to him. It worked out so well she had a second son in nearby Bradenton a few years later. The boys were American citizens and the whole family moved over to start their successful businesses.

The county takes its name from the Manatees who are languid, friendly creatures growing up to nine feet and weighing around 1,000lb from grazing on seagrass and other aquatic plants. Bradenton is the ""friendly city"" with parks, fine dining and walks along, you've guessed it, the Manatee River.

Its residents, blessed with mostly daily clear blue skies, are of sunny dispositions. Even the foreboding-sounding Mexican festival DÃ­a de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead, is turned into a party. We joined a cheery bunch in the art district.

Copying Mexico, there's street food, beer and wine and lots of music to welcome back souls of deceased relatives for joyous reunions. It takes place in Bradenton streets lined with 1920s and 1930s cottages where folk artists throw open their doors to studios, galleries and even homes to sell paintings and crafts. Mexican mariachi and brass bands lift the spirits, so to speak, and outside one gallery a Latina with a beautiful voice gets young and old salsa dancing up and down the sidewalk to welcome their ancestors.

For the second half of our stay we move to one of 30 luxurious two-bedroom villas at Waterline Marina Resort, which is on the island's bay side. To get around the island we hire a golf cart from Robinhood Rentals. Strange name for a Floridian business. It turns out the owner is Mark Toomey, who lived near Nottingham before following his American dream 16 years ago. Driving around in a cart gives an extra sense of freedom and closeness to the ­surroundings. We loved it.

We pull up at a beach on Anna Maria where Beach Suites set up two lounge chairs, a large parasol, a cooler with ice along with towels, a giant game of Jenga, a paddleball set, a frisbee and plenty of SPF50 sunscreen. It was like having a butler on the beach.

The following day we park our cart by the City Pier to board Paradise Boat Tours. Within 20 minutes we're watching dolphins chipping ­crustaceans loose from the dockside of some ­multimillion dollar homes. They curiously follow our boat and swim at high speed to fly out of the water to perform aquabatics.

Captain Jim and his first mate Kirk sail under the Cortez Draw Bridge where we spot a magnificent roseate ­spoonbill - it had flamingo-pink shoulders and a yellowish green head. A sea osprey with close to a 6ft wing span flew overhead gripping a large fish to feed on for days in its nest.

At the end of our 90-minute voyage we step on to the pier and directly into the Anna Maria Oyster Bar where brothers Lynn and John Horne provide super-fresh sea food meals. Lynn gets his oysters from beds along the Gulf Coast of Florida, Alabama, Texas and Louisiana. Raw or cooked, there's a delicious taste of the sea.

Seven hundred are sold every day in the bar - and don't miss out on the clam chowder. The Chateau Restaurant at the Waterline is a mix of the best of American and European dishes from the owners Buddy Foy Jr and his wife Jennifer who've recently moved to Anna Maria from New York State, where they still have the award-winning Chateau On The Lake in Bolton Landing.

The couple are very hands-on with their chefs cooking succulent prime cuts on an open grill and fresh seafood with pasta. America's jetBlue airline has made it very easy to fly to New York from Bradenton for those who would like to flop on beautiful beaches and shop in the Big Apple on the way home. It takes just two-and-a-half hours to land at JFK to take in one of the world's greatest cities. We did just that too.

Five years ago, a Consumer Reports study revealed the presence of toxic metals in several baby food products. Many of those foods still contain hazardous contaminants, a new study found

The Food and Drug Administration has cracked down on baby food companies for years.

Several studies from 2018 showed that many of their products contained toxic heavy metals like arsenic, lead and cadmium.

The government organisation has been pressuring them to remove the contaminants ""” but a recent Consumer Reports study indicates that their efforts might not have been very successful.

The overall risk of ingestion remains at similar levels compared to five years ago. And the levels of toxic metals in some products actually increased.

Consumer Reports retested 14 of the highest-risk foods from the 2018 study and found that three had decreased levels of harmful contaminants while the levels in the other 11 remained relatively similar or increased.

Gerber's Chicken Rice Dinner and Turkey Rice Dinner flavors and Hot Kid Baby Mum-Mum Teething Wafers had the most notable increases, while Earth's Best Organic Sunny Days Snack Bars strawberry flavour had the most significant decrease.

The products with the highest risk levels were:

For each of those products, Consumer Reports' experts recommend feeding babies less than a half a serving per day to minimise the danger of ingestion.

Collectively, the 14 tested products spanned an array of food types and ingredients, from fruits and vegetables to meals and entrees and snacks like bars, puffs and teething wafers.

Sweet potatoes and rice were common ingredients in most of the highest-risk products, much like the 2018 study found. Carrots were also a high-risk ingredient.

Many of those ingredients absorb the harmful metals from the soil in which they're grown.

Gerber told Consumer Reports that its working with farmers to ""prioritise growing locations for optimal climate and soil conditions"" and to ""approve fields before crops are planted based on soil testing.""

Its also ensuring that crops are rotated and continuing to research soil and varietal variables ""that may reduce uptake of heavy metals from the soil by carrots and sweet potatoes.""

Growing fields can be contaminated near airports and highways where gasoline can seep into the soil. Areas where arsenic pesticides have been used may also be at risk.

In January, the FDA released a set of guidelines designed to lower the allowable levels of heavy metals in baby foods.

It sets action levels of 10 parts per billion for lead in fruits, most vegetables, mixed meals like grain and meat-based mixtures, yogurts, custards and puddings and meat. Dry cereals, ingredient root vegetables like carrots, sweet potatoes and beats have an action level of 20 ppb.

If companies exceed those limits, various enforcement actions can be taken, Consumer Reports stated.

""The FDA estimates that these action levels could result in as much as a 24 to 27 percent reduction in exposure to lead from these foods,"" FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf said in a statement.

Babies and young children who eat large amounts of heavy metals are at a higher risk for behaviour problems, a lowered IQ and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

""Because heavy metals are so pervasive in foods ""” and because they tend to accumulate in the body ""” small exposures from multiple foods can add up,"" said Dr. Eric Boring, a CR chemist who oversaw Consumer Reports' testing.

But he said it's not the end of the world if parents feed their children a serving or two of the highest-risk foods.

""An occasional serving of even one of the foods with the highest levels is generally OK,"" he said. ""Just remember to mix up what your kids eat.""

And parents don't have to necessarily prevent their children from eating sweet potatoes or rice, either, said Consumer Reports Nutritionist Amy Keating.

""These are nutritious foods, so you don't have to eliminate them from your child's diet,"" Keating said. ""Instead, serve them in rotation with many different vegetables and whole grains.""

Haiti was already a vulnerable country and now the flooding has now pushed many to breaking point with damaged homes and displaced residents

Over 40 people have died in Haiti after torrential rain caused horrific and widespread flooding before an earthquake hit, emergency officials have said.

A further 13,000 have been displaced after their homes were damaged and at least 85 people are injured, according to Haiti's Civil Protection Agency.

The town of Leogane, located 25 miles southwest of the capital Port-au-Prince, was particularly badly hit, with damage caused by three flooded rivers.

In the already vulnerable country, this has now pushed many to breaking point.

The city's streets now have brown rivers running through them - damaging homes, displacing residents and carrying away cars and debris in its wake.

One resident of LÃ©ogÃ¢ne, Phania Cange, told the BBC how her home was swept away in the floods.

She managed to save one of her children but her five-year-old died in the flooding. She told the broadcaster: ""I risked losing two (children), but God left the other one hanging in a tree.""

LÃ©ogÃ¢ne's Mayor Ernson Henry said city residents were ""desperate"".

""They have lost everything. The waters have ravaged their fields, washed away their livestock,"" he told the AFP news agency.

Meanwhile, an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.9 struck southern Haiti early today, killing at least three people and injuring several others.

""I thought the whole house was going to fall on top of me"", Eric Mpitabakana, a World Food Program official in Jeremie, told The Associated Press by phone.

Several children are reportedly hospitalized with injuries they received after they panicked and ran.

Claude Prepetit, a geologist and engineer with Haiti's Bureau of Mines and Energy, told Radio Caraibes that smaller earthquakes that occurred earlier this year in southern Haiti led to the bigger one that struck Tuesday.

Almost two years ago a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck and killed more than 2,200 people. Some people who lost their homes last August are still living in camps.

The country is mired in continuous struggles with already weak infrastructure, which has been repeatedly wracked with criminal violence, political turmoil and natural disasters in recent years.

An owner of an adorable American bulldog noticed that people were avoiding his chilled pooch because they assumed he was an XL Bully - so he took matters into his own hands

With the rise in reports of XL Bully attacks, many people will be going out of their way to move when they see the now-banned breed when they're out and about. But it's also made people distrustful of larger dogs in general, and one man has had to take extreme measures to let other dog owners know that they and their dogs are safe when he's walking by.

Former bodyguard Matt Stait has been forced to sew patches reading ""I AM NOT AN XL BULLY"" on his pooch's harness as people have been mistaking him for the wrong breed, and have been avoiding him when they go out for walks. Matt said he's even noticed that previously friendly dog owners now don't stop to stroke American bulldog Eddie, seven, amid the spate of American XL bully attacks.

The 52-year-old was so disappointed that his 'affectionate' pooch was 'ostracised', so decided to get him a patch from Etsy to clear up any confusion - and he sewed them onto his harness on Sunday, September 24. He said that he hopes the 2.5-inch-long patches will encourage people to ask him about Eddie's breed.

The American bulldog dates back to the 17th century and was bred for farming and guarding livestock while the 'designer' XL bully only dates back to the 1980s and is a mix of several other breeds including the American pitbull.

Dad-of-one Matt admitted that Eddie ""could have been problematic"" if he'd not had the correct training from a young age, and he said that he thinks it should be compulsory to train dogs and to check that owners are suitable for the dogs. Matt, from Chepstow, South Wales, said: ""Lots of people have confused my dog with an XL bully so I ordered them because I want them to start a conversation. We used to get a lot of interest for a positive reason but now it's different. People aren't saying they're avoiding us on purpose but that's what's happening.

""You get a lot of dirty looks and you don't know how much of that is paranoia because they've been reading these stories about attacks. There's always been an element of people picking up their children and small dogs and crossing the street but I'm seeing that more and more now. It's a shame for Eddie. He's being ostracised and not getting the opportunity to meet dogs and people in the way he used to.

""I thought that rather than have any confusion or stupid conversations I'd have the patch and hopefully it can create an understanding and I can explain the difference. Some people think it's a brilliant idea and then there are also people who think I should be fighting for all dogs and not trying to dissociate from them. I do get that point of view.""

The dad-of-one doesn't believe in banning dog breeds but insists more suitability checks should be in place when people try to buy large dogs to ensure they're able to train and look after them properly. Matt said: ""Eddie's incredibly affectionate and loving to his family but he's a large dog and bred for farming, utility work, and guarding so he will bark at the window when somebody knocks on the door. He's a large and capable dog and if he hadn't been trained and socialised or given what he needs then I don't doubt that he could be problematic. I'd be lying if I said otherwise.

""Here lies the issue with who should own the dogs and what requirements there should be. Overall I'm not for banning specific breeds and I'd look towards licensing and much tighter rules for breeders like compulsory training and suitability checks. The dogs don't actually have a voice and unfortunately, the people who do have a voice and are loud aren't necessarily informed.""

Matt is concerned the XL bully ban may cover American bulldogs and that would mean they wouldn't be allowed to train, go to kennels, or visit campsites with 'no-banned-breed policies'. He's also keen to combat the view that anyone owning large dogs are thugs as he claims 'for the most part' they're bought as they suit the owner's active lifestyle.

This unspoilt green gem off the Scottish comes with 25 miles of space and is surrounded by vast swathes of the Atlantic Ocean - but it's cost you £150k

In a country as small as ours, it's not often you hear of entire private islands up for sale.

This 'romantic' Scottish island is an ideal investment for anyone looking for a bit of peace and quiet - provided you have £150k to spare.

With a population of currently nil, Barlocco is one of several islands making up the Isles of Fleet off the Dumfries and Galloway coast, and it could be yours for the price of a London parking space.

The 25-mile rocky stretch of land provides the lucky owner with breath-taking views of the Irish Sea, a wealth of unspoilt nature and all the privacy you could ever need.

Commutes from Barlocco are made by boat or tractor at low tide only - but at least you won't be stuck sitting in traffic or at the mercy of public transport.

And it's perfect for birdspotters too - gulls dominate Barlocco's breeding seabird populations with notable populations of great black-backed and common gulls.

Smaller numbers of breeding guillemot, razorbill and fulmar are also found.

A flood pond provides water for wildlife and livestock if the new owners wish to graze animals, and neighbouring isles in Fleet Bay include Ardwall Island, and Murray's Isles.

Recreational activities can be enjoyed from bird spotting to island walks, sea angling and additional watersports from the island's very own private pebble beach.

Aaron Edgar, handling the sale for Galbraith, said: ""Barlocco Island is in a truly stunning location near Kirkcudbright in Dumfries and Galloway and within an area of scientific interest both geologically and biologically.

""There's still a very romantic sentiment attached to owning your very own Scottish private island, where you can escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life and enjoy some peace and tranquillity in the most beautiful scenery around.

""The pebble beach is a delight and the perfect base to explore the island, partake in some cold water swimming or to anchor a boat and enjoy a waterside picnic.

""We have witnessed strong demand from domestic and international parties for entire private islands having handled the sale of several in Scotland, so we expect a lot of interest.""

Currently there are no dwellings or buildings on the Island and no current or historic planning consents or applications relating to the Island.

Any planning opportunities should be investigated by the buyer directly with the local planning authority.

Barlocco Island, Borgue, Kirkcudbright, is for sale through Galbraith at offers over £150,000.

Residents living near Lake Baringo in Kenya have been subjected to countless attacks by hippos and crocodiles - the lake has grown so much in size that the predators are lurking near their homes

Locals desperate for freshwater have been forced to use a deadly lake that is infested with hippos and crocodiles where some have lost their legs in attacks.

Residents, who live near Lake Baringo in Kenya, have no choice but to face their fears due to the lake being their lifeline. According to Environmentalists, the lake has doubled in size over the last ten years due to heavy rainfall linked to climate change. However, the unsettling water levels have sparked an increase in predators and attacks. Joseph Atuma says he has just started fishing in the lake, five years after a hippo lunged at his canoe and tore part of his left leg off. ""It was hiding in the bushes, very near to the shore, a place where I wouldn't expect a hippo to be. And it caught me by surprise,"" he recalled. ""It sank its teeth onto the wooden canoe and into my leg. Very little meat was left on my bone, between the knee and the foot.""

He said he finally re-visited the lake due to financial needs, reports BBC. ""This is my bread and butter,"" he continued. ""I have tried some odd jobs here and there, but I cannot sustain my family."" The lake has grown so much that it has pushed out communities and covered buildings including schools, homes and hospitals.

Winnie Keben miraculously survived a crocodile attack as she was collecting water whilst washing her feet. Describing the moment she spotted the monster, she said: ""I jumped and shouted. I tried to escape but it attacked and grabbed my leg pulling me into the water. It eventually released my foot and bit my thigh, breaking it. An onlooker grabbed a machete and rescued me from the crocodile but my leg was chewed off.""

The mum-of-six faced a six-month hospital stay and had to have a prosthetic leg fitted. But things went from bad to worse after she returned home to discover the property had been submerged by water. She has not returned since but is still haunted by the prospect that the river will expand to reach her new home.

Following safety fears of families and children, 66 residents have launched a lawsuit against the Kenyan government. They accused the authority of failing to respond to the climate crisis. They are pleading for financial compensation after many of them had to wave goodbye to livestock and ancestral land. Other issues cited include being exposed to diseases such as malaria and cholera.

Court papers filed on the communities' behalf by the legal advice centre, Kituo Cha Sheria, partially read: ""Entities responsible for putting in place relevant climate change policies to guarantee the right to a clean and healthy environment failed, refused and or neglected to do so."" The government has yet to respond to the lawsuit.

Locations used in the Harry Potter, Star Wars and Lord of the Rings franchises are all open for visitors, as are the real world sets employed by the likes of The Shining and The Kings Speech

Some of the most iconic film locations in the world aren't actually CGI or sets built for purpose - they're very much real places you can visit.

In the magical world of modern movie making, the trickery of computer designers and set designers allows a simple green screen or warehouse to be turned into a faraway world.

While there are films which existed only in this pretend world of CGI and model making, others use real world backdrops for scenes which have since become iconic.

According to a study of web searches and social media tags conducted by PACasino, the most popular film location in the world is Hobbiton in New Zealand, which was used throughout the Lord of The Rings film trilogy.

Director and Lord of the Rings mega-fan Peter Jackson went to enormous lengths to create as much of Middle Earth as possible in our world, and so went about building the idyllic home of the halflings.

Today Hobbiton is open for tours and is situated on the north island on the farm of the Alexander family.

They moved onto the 500 acre plot in the 70s and turned it into a livestock ranch with 13,000 sheep and 300 Angus beef cattle, before Jackson came along and moulded its grassy hills into the iconic Hobbit holes.

Another very popular film location is Glenfinnan Viaduct in the Scottish Highlands.

Fans of the franchise will recognise the lengthy rail bridge from the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter film, when Harry and Ron chase after the Hogwarts Express in Mr Weasley's flying Ford Anglia.

Visitors to the real world bridge can witness the impressively curved construction before stopping off for some afternoon tea in the visitor centre and listening to some doleful bagpipe music in the usually drizzle covered car park.

Just a few hour car drive to the south of the viaduct will get you to Alnwick Castle in Northumberland, which was used as a location in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.

The 11th century building starred as the magical Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the 2001 film, and is open four tourists today.

As is the infamous Timberline Lodge, which is best known for featuring in classic horror The Shining and providing the eerie backdrop for Jack Nicholson's descent into madness.

The Oregon lodge is still a functioning hotel and is a popular tourist attraction that draws two million visitors annually.

On the more glamorous end of the spectrum is Skopelos, the Greek island which was used as the location of the Abba inspired Mamma Mia!

Fans of the Swedish mega-group and of Pierce Brosnan can sign themselves up for a tour of the beautiful island and some of the particularly scenic spots that appear in the film.

Back in the UK, Ely Cathedral is not only a magnificent building in its own right, but the location of one of the most significant scenes in the Colin Firth film The King's Speech.

It was was transformed into the interior of Westminster Abbey for the film which won five gongs at the British Independent Film Awards.

A slightly less obvious location choice is an Irish island that was used as a backdrop in Star Wars.

Skellig Michael is a crag off the south west tip of the island which provided one of the major movie sets used in A Force Awakens.

The rocky formation is a fair way from the mainland but can be reached via boat on a specialist tour.

One filming destination with a slightly more central location is Pike Place in Seattle.

The city centre market has been used in a number of different films, not least the 1993 Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan classic Sleepless in Seattle.

Another one for rom-com fans - albeit of a later generation - is Silver Falls State Park in Oregon.

The forested park is used extensively in the Twilight franchise, although the main actors were represented by body doubles during the four scenes shot here.

Whether Team Edward or Jacob, fans of the film won't be disappointed when making a pilgrimage here, as it has some stunning waterfalls, eight miles of walking trails and a black bear population.

A more recent destination for film fans is Joker Stairs in New York.

Since the Batman spin-off hit screens four years ago, many have flocked to the Bronx stairway to imitate Joaquin Phoenix' iconic and creepy dance.

According to the United States Geological Survey, the deadly chronic wasting disease leaves animals confused, drooling, and unafraid of humans. It was first discovered in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming

Humans should be prepared for a ""slow-moving disaster"" as a horrific zombie deer disease spreads across at least 32 states in America and parts of Canada.

The deadly disease, known as chronic wasting disease (CWD), leaves animals confused, drooling, and unafraid of humans. It was first discovered in November following a deer carcass testing positive for the disease in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.

According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the virus has been detected in 32 states and four Canadian provinces. The large majority of cases have been reported in the upper Midwest, as well as the mid-Atlantic states. Kansas, Nebraska, and Wisconsin have all reported cases of the virus. Dr Michael Osterholm has dubbed the disease a ""slow-moving disaster"" which has the possibility of spreading to humans.

Dr Cory Anderson, the program co-director at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, believes thousands have possibly already eaten meat from infected deer. He told The Guardian: ""The BSE (mad cow) outbreak in Britain provided an example of how, overnight, things can get chaotic when a spillover event occurs, say, from livestock to people.

""We're talking about the potential of something similar occurring. No one is saying that it's definitely going to happen, but it's important for people to be prepared.""

Samples from the body of the infected deer tested positive for CWD multiple times, according to the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's (WGFD) Wildlife Health Laboratory. The testing of dead and alive animals includes taking samples from the creature's nervous system tissue, either from the central nervous system, like the spinal cord, or peripheral systems, such as the retropharyngeal lymph nodes and the tonsils.

Dr Anderson added the disease is ""invariably fatal, incurable, and highly contagious"" as it can cause weight loss, loss of coordination and other fatal neurological symptoms in deer and related species.

He said: ""'Baked into the worry is that we don't have an effective easy way to eradicate it, neither from the animals it infects nor the environment it contaminates.' The US National Park Service said last month: ""There is currently no evidence that CWD can infect humans or domestic animal species.""

According to Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, studies have proved that the disease posed a risk to non-human primates including monkeys. 'These studies raise concerns that there may also be a risk to people,' the agency said. 'Since 1997, the World Health Organisation has recommended that it is important to keep the agents of all known prion diseases from entering the human food chain.""

Following the discovery of the disease, Yellowstone authorities are revising their strategy for surveillance and dealing with more sick animals as CWD is ""density-dependent"", meaning infection rates are higher where large numbers of animals come together.

Dr Thomas Roffe, a vet and former chief of animal health for the Fish & Wildlife Service, admitted: ""There's a lot at stake for the Yellowstone ecosystem and a lot at stake for all Americans who enjoy having healthy wildlife on the landscape.""

Bobi, the world's oldest dog, has turned 31 and is celebrating the occasion with a huge party at his family farmhouse in Portugal. People will be flying across countries to join him

Portuguese farm dog Bobi, who set the record for the world's oldest living dog earlier in the year, celebrated another milestone yesterday - turning 31 years old.

Bobi, who is also the oldest verified dog in history, was born on May 11 1992 and was awarded the Guinness World Record title in February.

The OAP pooch will be celebrating the momentous occasion with a ""very traditional"" Portuguese party this weekend on the family farm where he was born, in the village of Conqueiros.

Around 100 guests are expected to come to celebrate the very special birthday boy, with people flying in from around the world to join the party.

His family are pulling out all the stops, and guests will be dining on local meats and fish, with extra for Bobi, as he only eats human food.

As entertainment, a dace troupe will perform with a special appearance of the main dog himself in one of the dances.

Life has been hectic for Bobi since being crowned the oldest dog in the world in February.

Bobi's owner, Leonel Costa, told Guinness World Records: ""We've had a lot of journalists and people come from all over the world to take a picture with Bobi.

""They've come from all over Europe, as well as the USA and even Japan.""

Bobi is a purebred Rafeiro do Alentejo, a breed of livestock guardian dog, and has miraculously doubled the average life expectancy of 12-14 years.

The dog has lived his entire life with the Costa family in the rural village of Conqueiros, in Leiria, Portugal.

Owner Leonel shared that Bobi's health has been good lately, although he recently went to the vet for a check-up after he was concerned about the potential stress it was causing the dog to have so many visitors.

""There were a lot of pictures taken and he had to get up and down many times. It wasn't easy for him,"" Leonel added.

His family credit his long life down to the ""calm, peaceful environment"" he lives in. Bobi roamed freely in the forests surrounding their house, and never used a leash or chain.

Leonel describes him as a ""very sociable"" dog who grew up surrounded by many other animals, so he was never lonely. He also eats human food and mostly eats the same as his owners, although they make sure to soak it in water to remove the seasoning first.

""Between a can of animal food or a piece of meat, Bobi doesn't hesitate and chooses our food,"" Leonel added.

Australian cattle dog Bluey was previously the oldest dog to ever exist, and lived to be 29 years and five months old.

Bobi's birth date and age has been verified by SIAC, a Portuguese pet database, and the Veterinary Medical Service of the Municipality of Leiria.

The New Forest and Lake District are the best national parks in Europe for hiking trails, according to an analysis of the areas by outdoor specialists Cotswolds

Two of the UK's cherished national parks have been judged to be the best in Europe.

The New Forest and Lake District came first and second respectively in an analysis of the best spots to hike across the Continent, carried out by outdoor specialists Cotswold Outdoor.

Securing top spot, the New Forest boasts the best choice of amenities and activities, housing six campsites, 25 viewpoints/historical landmarks and a great choice of hiking trails (216).

The Hampshire-based Park doesn't fall short in the popularity category either, ranking as Europe's sixth most popular, boasting 973,022 hashtags on Instagram, 22,200 average global searches and a 4.8 rating.

Claiming second, the Lake District has the most hiking trails of all European national parks, offering visitors a whopping 1,273 routes for walkers to explore.

It is also something of a social media icon, being beaten by just Teide in Spain for the title of ""Europe's Most Popular"", raking in 74,000 global searches on average and over 438,000 hashtags.

Hiking has become increasingly popular over the last couple of years, possibly fuelled by lockdown which led many people to outdoor activities for the first time.

A 2023 travel study of 24,000 holidaymakers found that 58% of British travellers are increasingly seeking trips that push them to the limits and out of their comfort zone.

The Lake District may be the perfect place to do just that, due to the grandeur and ruggedness of its mountain landscapes.

Routes are more likely to be easy going in the New Forest, where heathland, forest trails and native ponies abound.

The best hiking national parks in Europe

UK law has enshrined certain beautiful parts of the country as national parks since the early 1950s.

Unlike the many areas overseas covered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's definition, UK national parks are generally not made up of publicly owned land, meaning large parts of them are ruled out of bounds by private land owners.

Research by the Campaign for National Parks shows that just 10% of the Pembrokeshire coast land is open to the public, while just over a third of the Peak District is accessible.

Only half of Dartmoor, the New Forest and the Lake District are open to the public.

So if you are planning a trip to one of the UK's 14 National Parks, make sure you plan your route out before hand as you aren't legally allowed to roam freely.

Those who like to hike and make the most of Britain's beautiful landscape were dealt a blow on Friday, when a High Court judged ruled that people do not have a right to wild camp in Dartmoor National Park without landowners' permission.

The decision was called a ""huge step backward"", as disappointed campaigners vowed to ""go to war"" and challenge the decision.

Farmers Alexander and Diana Darwall brought a successful legal challenge over wild camping, claiming some campers cause problems to livestock and the environment.

Mr and Mrs Darwall, who keep cattle on Stall Moor, which forms part of their more-than 3,450-acre estate in the southern part of Dartmoor, secured a finding from a judge that a 1985 law that regulates access to moorland does not provide a right to wild camp.

The Dartmoor National Park Authority (DNPA), which defended the High Court claim, said it was ""really disappointed"" by Sir Julian Flaux's ruling and would be considering whether to appeal.

The Ramblers Association, a walking charity now known as the Ramblers, tweeted: ""This decision is a huge step backward for the right of everyone to access nature.""

It said it supported the ""long-established precedent"" of wild camping on Dartmoor and said it would fight to ""defend our rights of access & overturn this result"".

Shaun and Cory came across the ghostly animal when returning to their home on Prestatyn High Street, Denbighshire

A 4ft-long albino snake is not an everyday find just off a bustling high street in a seaside town in North Wales. When her son Cory ran indoors saying he'd found one, Kelsie Cox just assumed it was a toy snake left lying around.

As she has a fear of snakes, Kelsie quickly made herself scarce when husband Shaun confirmed the snow-white reptile was very much real and alive. Cory and sister Phoebe watched on as their dad took photos, retrieved the snake and placed it in a box.

Shaun and Cory came across the ghostly animal when returning to their home on Prestatyn High Street, Denbighshire, reports North Wales Live.

""It was in the back garden just lying in the sun,"" said Kelsie.

""When Cory came running inside saying he's found a snake, I was thinking it was a fake one. I'm terrified of snakes - I didn't get very close but my children loved it. I left Shaun to care for it while I shared a photo on social media.""

She wasn't the only one left feeling slightly queasy. Seeing Kelsie's post, a Deganwy woman said: ""I think I would have died if I'd stumbled across that on the High Street."" A man expressed similar sentiments. ""If I saw that I would be the first man on Mars,"" he shivered.

Identified as a non-venomous Corn snake, it is thought to be a ""Snow"" morph as it had hints of orange-yellow pigmentation. Despite their strange appearance, white Corns are relatively common as they have become popular as pets.

When no one stepped forward to claim the Prestatyn snake, Kelsie contacted Idlewild Animal Sanctuary in the Conwy Valley. As well as offering respite for rescued birds and livestock, it rehabilitates injured and sicky animals, and rehomes others.

After accepting the Corn snake into her care, sanctuary manager Kim Barton-Jones said it was ""definitely hungry"". She added: ""The poor snake made short work of some food.""

Cats and chickens are more commonly rehomed by Idlewild, though earlier this year the sanctuary appealed for new homes for 56 mice. Snakes are a relative rarity, though last month a 4ft Boa Constrictor was voluntarily surrendered to its care.

No one has yet offered it a new home. ""Not a lot of people have the right facilities for a Boa Constrictor,"" said Kim.

Neither has the owner of Prestatyn's albino Corn snake been identified so far. They have seven days to come forward and show proof of ownership, such as photos and vet references.

If the owner is not traced, the snake will be offered to people with experience of looking after reptiles. Already there have been plenty of offers for the ""absolutely beautiful"" snake.

Kelsie's children were ""amazed"" to find a snake in their garden but, given their mum's phobia, they won't get to rehome it. ""It was definitely a different type of day,"" said Kelsie. ""I didn't expect it at all but I'm glad the snake is safe.""

Visitors to the Lake District in Cumbria have have been told to stay way from the Thirlmere reservoir after toxic algae which 'looked like green paint' was spotted

People visiting the Lake District have been told to stay away from certain waters after toxic algae was spotted.

Blooms of poisonous blue-green algae were found in the water at Thirlmere reservoir, prompting the Environment Agency to take samples at the Cumbria site on July 14.

It comes after visitors reported some of the water looking ""like green paint"".

Dog walker Rose Gare-Simmons said she had to take her Labrador retriever Blisco, to the vet after he went in the water after a walk and needed injections to induce vomiting after his paddle.

Ms Gare-Simmons, from Morecambe, explained it was a really hot day and she had been worried her pet would suffer heatstroke after a long walk at Raven Crag.

She decided to take him to Thirlmere to cool off, however he ran off ahead and she lost sight of him because the area was so overgrown.

She said: ""Blisco had run ahead and I caught up with him in the water less than a minute later. I saw the state of the water, it was so green and thick it looked like paint.

""I panicked and got him out and took him to a clearer bit of water to wash him. I heard that algae can kill dogs within an hour as it is so poisonous so I rang the vet and we were in the car within seconds.""

Blue-green algae occurs naturally in bodies of freshwater, but some kinds can be toxic to humans and lethal to animals.

During a bloom, the water becomes less clear and may look green, blue-green or greenish-brown.

Scums can form during calm weather when several bloom-forming species rise to the surface. This can look like paint, mousse or small clumps.

An Environment Agency spokesman said: ""Cyanobacteria or 'blue-green algae', a type of blooming algae, can produce toxins.

""These toxins can kill wild animals, livestock and pets. They can also harm people, producing rashes after skin contact and illnesses if swallowed.

""We have informed the landowners and other statutory bodies so that action can be taken to put up signs to alert the public.""

Zoologist Matt Staniek previously warned ""people's health is being put at risk"" after blooms were reported in Windermere in 2022.

Mr Staniek, who last month led a campaign against the discharge of sewage into the lake, claimed phosphate, coming from United Utilities' owned sites, was feeding the blooms.

Environment Agency bosses said they had spent hundreds of thousands of pounds in the past decade to help tackle the problem.


United Utilities said it recognised there were concerns and it was committed to ""playing its part"" in minimising its impact to Windermere.

Amanda Owen, star of Our Yorkshire Farm, shared the cheeky comment with her fans after she revealed she and ex-husband Clive had reunited for a family party

Amanda Owen, 48, has cheekily claimed ""size matters"" amid a reunion with her ex-husband Clive, 68, with whom she shares nine children.

The Our Yorkshire Farm star recently delighted fans by getting together with Clive for a rare occasion with all of their brood, almost a year on from the former couple announcing the end of their marriage. 

The telly favourite showed there was no animosity between the former spouses as they posed for some snaps outside the family home.

Last summer, Amanda and Clive announced their relationship for good, with the author revealing the news on Instagram, writing: ""Although we are no longer a couple, we continue to work on the farm and co-parent together, with our number one priority the happiness and well-being of our children.""

They had previously gone through a rocky patch in 2021 while Amanda promoted her book but later reconciled.

Amanda has built a huge following on social media since the show Our Yorkshire Farm launched on Channel 5 and regularly updates her fans with the comings and goings on the yard.

Taking to Twitter to share the cheeky message about ""size matters"" with her 208,000 followers, she showcased two of her prized horses.

Addressing her fans, she wrote using a mixture of emojis to explain what she meant.

She wrote: ""Tony the pony winning the prize this morning. ( A Clydesdale size portion of hot mash that was left cooling ). *Maple can reach the latch & has learnt how to open the bottom stable door.""

She finished the tweet with the hashtags #smallisbeautiful #bigisbeautiful.

In the adorable photo of two of the residents of Ryedale Farm, Tony the Pony can be seen tucking into a huge bucket, while Maple looks mischievous as they attempt to sneak out of the stable.

Amanda's joke was met with much amusement from her fans with many replying to the post, with one writing: ""Cheeky"" about the innuendo.

Most of the comments were aimed at the adorable animals.

""The face!!,"" exclaimed one tweeter, adding: ""That was ""MY* breakfast.""

Another person teased: ""Hooves at dawn for eating my breakfast.""

""Poor baby maple, maybe tomorrow she will get the mash after pulling the whole door frame out!Strong,"" added a third social media user.

Following Amanda and Clive's split Our Yorkshire Farm, which chronicled their life at Ravenseat Farm, was cancelled.

However, Amanda has started to film a new More4 documentary, called Amanda Owen's Farming Lives which is her first series on her own without Clive.

The ex-couple are now supporting their brood, who range in age from 21 to five, and Amanda, 48, has been open about the reality of co-parenting, after she moved to a separate farmhouse on their land, with some of the kids.

The mum has also previously insisted there is ""no problem"" between herself and Clive and shut down any suggestion a third party was involved in the split.

Reruns of Our Yorkshire Farm are shown on Channel 5. Amanda Owen's Farming Lives is available on More4.

The second season of Jeremy Clarkson's adventures on Diddly Squat Farm has beaten the BRIT Awards and Love Island to be one of the most watched shows in the UK with 4.3million viewers

Jeremy Clarkson will challenge his local council's decision to refuse plans for him to build a restaurant on his farm.

Clarkson submitted two appeals against the West Oxfordshire District Council decision and will face a key meeting in March to decide the fate of Diddly Squat Farm.

As shown in his hit Amazon Prime show, the council initially refused plans to extend the shop car park and ordered Jeremy, 62, to cease trading in his restaurant.

Clarkson's farm is located in the Cotswold Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty meaning it is subject to tighter planning restrictions.

Officials claim the business ""continued to operate outside the planning permissions granted"" and that ""advice has been ignored"".

So the Top Gear star wrote to the council stating he no longer wished to open a restaurant - but has since had a change of heart.

After only making a measly £144 profit last year, according to reports, Jeremy needed to diversify and wanted to transform his lambing barn into a restaurant serving his own meat.

However, according to his letter, his efforts were ""thwarted by the enforcement notice"" and he was forced to sell most of his cows.

The car park idea is reportedly a priority for Jeremy as he does not want to turn Diddly Squat farm into ""Disneyland"".

He added: ""It is, after all, where I live.""

The runaway success of Clarkson's Farm meant the previously sleepy area of Chipping Norton is now attracting thousands of visitors, causing huge traffic and parking issues.

To solve the problem, Jeremy applied for permission to open a parking area in an adjacent field but it was refused by West Oxfordshire District Council in May 2022 due to concerns over sustainability and the impact on the surrounding countryside.

In the second series of Clarkson's Farm on Amazon Prime Video Clarkson is seen clashing with the council.

He stormed out of a council meeting after several councillors voted against his plans.

Liam Walker, who is a Conservative member of the Oxfordshire County Council, backs Clarkson and believes it will be a boost to local businesses.

He tweeted: ""All is not over yet""¦ @JeremyClarkson has lodged an appeal against West Oxfordshire District Council for both farm shop car park extension & the enforcement notice for opening a restaurant without planning. The planning inspector will conduct the hearing in March.""

In a response to someone saying they hoped Clarkson won, he said: ""100%! Local councils need to understand and appreciate farming has significantly changed for many reasons and the planning rules need to also change to allow them to diversify quickly. Farmers right across the country deserve our support.""

At the time, the council said in a statement: ""We understand that the planning process shown in season two of Clarkson's Farm can seem obstructive and that people will be confused by the planning decisions at Diddly Squat Farm.

""As with any other planning authority, we have a legal responsibility to make sure that planning laws and policies are followed correctly by everyone to manage development and protect local communities and the environment.

""This is regardless of who they are and we treat Diddly Squat Farm no differently.""

Clarkson's Farm has broken new records for after it became one of the most watched shows after it was released last week.

The platform revealed 4.3million viewers watched the second season of the farming reality show, making it Amazon's highest rated show since the company began reporting viewing figures in November 2021.

The figures for Clarkson's adventures at Diddly Squat Farm even beat The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power which reached 3.2million viewers when it was released last year. The show was also watched by more viewers than Love Island and the Brit Awards.

Farmer Will Young has been left single in the villa after new bombshell Love Island hunk Tom Clare stole ring girl Olivia Hawkins from him

Love Island fans have called for ITV to step in and remove Will Young from the villa.

Viewers have expressed concern for the loveable farmer after he was left suddenly single when bombshell Tom Clare swooped in and stole Olivia Hawkins.

The move leaves Will vulnerable ahead of the first recoupling on Friday night.

The 23-year-old from Buckinghamshire was handed a lifeline with bombshell Zara arriving to shake things up, but the model has had her head turned by Will's rival boys and has so far shunned his advances.

Fans thought Will appeared to be struggling with single life as he vowed he wouldn't stop grafting until he got his girl.
Tonight's recoupling will see the girls pick which boy they'd like to spend the next few days with, and with Will failing to find a connection fans are concerned he could be first out the door.
So far Will has been a hit with the boys but less so with the girls in the house with viewers hoping he's put out of his 'misery' soon.

One viewer tweeted: ""Do the Love Island producers pick somebody to go on every year that doesn't fit the profile just to show that they are inclusive... Poor Will it's cruel tbh.""

Another suggested that Will's confidence appeared to be dwindling. ""Love Island is a cruel place man,"" they said of the recoupling twist.

On Reddit, comments were similar as one fan suggested Will was there for the 'joke factor'.

Another chimed in by saying: ""Will needs all the help he can get poor thing"" as they noted he'd been 'friend zoned' by the girls.

One fan even suggested: ""They need to bring a farmer girl for Will that's the only way this'll work.""

Since appearing in the starting line up on the dating reality show, Will has won over fans for his fresh-faced honesty and quirky dance moves.

One fan shared on Twitter : ""Will is great he's the only one on the show with real talent, and that talent is just being himself and not caring about what anyone else thinks. Go yourself, Will.""

Another added: ""I really enjoy Will on Love Island. He's genuinely good vibes and that's rare to see.""

Love Island viewers also noticed narrator Ian Stirling made a cheeky swipe at the young farmer, and they did not like it.

Moments before scenes aired showing Will and Zara chatting, Iain was heard discussing what was coming up, saying: ""Will is grafting Zara and when talking to the ladies, it seems Will has two approaches.

""Suave and charming and Cbeebies presenter - see if you can tell which one he's gone for.""

Singleton Will was next seen trying to get to know bombshell Zara as he attempts to find love and couple up.

Despite his poor luck so far, viewers may see Will's tide turn ahead of the recoupling tonight.

An explosive row on Thursday night - that followed a shocking game of beer pong, appears to have left all the original couples far from safe.

Find out tonight what goes down in the recoupling when Love Island returns tonight on ITV2 at 9pm.

Australian bombshell Jessie Wynter hasn't left Farmer Will's side since the pair were booted from the Love Island villa just days before the grande finale, and now the reality TV star has made a huge decision amid their romance

Love Island star Jessie Wynter has made a huge life decision based on her relationship with Farmer Will Young.

The Love Island stars fell head over heels for one another on the Winter series of the ITV2 dating show, and now Jessie, who originally hails from Australia, has decided to stay put in the UK for Will, with the pair already looking for a place to live together.

Jessie, 26, originally from Tasmania, has no plans on going home anytime soon after falling for TikTok sensation Farmer Will, 32.

The Aussie bombshell hasn't left Will's side since the pair were booted from the villa days before the grande finale, and Jessie is now preparing to move in with Will and his parents on their farm in Buckinghamshire.

Jessie now sees a future in the UK, and hopes to live here permanently after becoming a huge hit with Love Island fans on the 2023 Winter series of the hit dating show.

Although Jessie will have to briefly return to home soil to 'swap over her suitcase' and reset her visa, she has long-term plans to stay in the UK with her new man, with Jessie admitting that the UK now 'feels like home' to her.

""The plan is to come back to the UK for the long term. I love it here and I haven't experienced the warmer weather yet, so I'm not going back to Australia before I get some sunshine,"" she told OK! Magazine.

""This is my first time proper in the UK. It's just so weird, I was saying to Will that usually people plan it when they move to a different country but I've just kind of ended up here. I am loving the UK. It feels like home to me.""

Jessie was also an instant hit with Will's parents, admitting that she has become very close to his mum.

""Now I'm living on the farm, I'm really close with Will's mum, because she's only got two sons. Will's dad always tells me 'it's so nice having a girl around,"" Jessie gushed.

Despite the fact she's having a blast while living with Will's parents, Jessie revealed that the couple are looking to get their own place in the near future.

And if Will's TikTok career is anything to go by, money won't be an issue for the couple when looking for their first home together.

Will's TikTok has soared to even greater lengths as the 23-year-old, who already has over 1.5 million followers in TikTok, is reportedly set to earn a whopping £15,000 per video on the social media platform.

According to digital marketing agency, 10 Yetis, Will can also reportedly make £2,510 per Instagram post.

Meanwhile, the TikTok farmer's flame Jessie can reportedly earn £3,820 per post on the social media platform.

However, she falls behind Will on potential TikTok earnings with a reported £4,000 per post if he continues to create videos which are only 15 seconds long.

It's all about farm life for Kelvin Fletcher and his family and not only are they returning with a brand new show, they're also inviting fans and their little ones along

Kelvin Fletcher says he can't wait to welcome fans to his farm when he throws open its doors at Christmas.

The Emmerdale star and his wife look set to rake in the cash over the festive period weeks after he announced his latest career move. Kelvin and his wife Liz live on a 120-acre farm with their four children and there's going to be more people around after deciding to put their home to good use.

After doing something similar at Easter, they've decided to get Santa involved this time. They'll give kids a day they'll never forget with animals a plenty and he wrote: ""Fletchers on the Farm Presents""¦""¦""¦.SANTA'S VILLAGE!! After the incredible success of our Easter Wonderland event, we have decided to open up our farm THIS CHRISTMAS. We can't wait to welcome you and your family for the MOST MAGICAL event of the season.""

It comes after it emerged ITV would be following the family on the farm for a brand-new series. Kelvin, who played Andy Sugden on Emmerdale for 20 years, revealed the new show is called Fletcher's Family Farm. It will follow the adventures of Kelvin, his actress wife and kids Marnie, six, Milo, four, and one-year-old twin boys Maximus and Mateusz.

Viewers got a glimpse into Kelvin's life on the farm when he starred in a six-part series on the BBC last year. Kelvin's Big Farming Adventure followed the actor as he learned how to run a farm, just like his former character. With the help of a next-door neighbour, Gilly, who has experience in the industry, Kelvin and his family got stuck into all that farm life brings.

Kelvin and Liz said: ""When we embarked on this new chapter of our lives, we couldn't have imagined what an extraordinary journey it would be. Since the arrival of out two new-born twins last year, it has been even more of a rollercoaster ride... Navigating farming life with four small kids is certainly a challenge but one full of laughter and unforgettable memories.

""We are so excited to invite viewers into our lives like never before - we hope to share the beauty and unpredictable joy of life on our farm."" Series Editor, Ben Harris, from Daisybeck Studios, said: ""As first-generation farmers, Kelvin and Liz, have their work cut out, sharing their journey as they strive to make their farm a success whilst balancing the complexities of family life with the lows and highs of farming.

""It will be a revealing and heart-warming insight into farming today. One of the things that strikes me the most is just the joyful nature of this family and how they are embracing this new life. This is going to be a real treat for the audience.""

Antiques Roadshow's Will Farmer has opened up about an awkward episode of the BBC show in which a guest flounced off 'with a sour face' after disagreeing with the expert's valuation

An Antiques Roadshow expert was left mortified when a guest stormed off after their item was valued.

Ceramics expert Will Farmer has worked on the BBC show since 2006. However, after a man rocked up with a green glass bottle, the antiques buff endured one of his most awkward moments in the series.

Explaining the guest bought the bottle from an antique shop, Will said: ""It was sold as a very rare 17th-century glass bottle and he said he'd paid £1,000 for it."" However, after the expert discussed the item with his colleagues, he then had to break the news the 'antique' was in fact just a glass bottle - and wasn't worth the £1,000 price tag.

Speaking about his conversation with his fellow experts, Will explained: ""I said, 'Gentlemen, before I go and make a balls up here, make a fool of myself, what is this?'"" He continued: ""I had to go back and I remember this poor man's face dropped. He just took it out of my hand, put it in the bag, and walked off,"" reports The Express.

The much-loved BBC show is a jewell in the broadcaster's crown and Will explained the importance of treating the guests and their items with respect. He shared: ""They will have waited four or five hours in the queue and will be there five to ten minutes. That's what they've worked for.You've got to make that person feel like that five, ten minutes has been worth it. And you know what? The majority of things are, obviously of value...some of them can be no value at all or very, very little value.""

While Will's guest was far from pleased with his valuation, another collector was a cock-a-hoop with theirs. Expert Richard Price left a watch owner speechless as he priced up the family heirloom.

The vintage timepiece took Richard by surprise during the Oxfordshire leg of the show. He explained from the start that the genuine vintage Submariners Rolex was set to bring in some serious money.

The guest told Richard: ""It was my dad's watch. He bought it for himself in 1972 when I was seven and me, my mum, my dad and my brother went to Birmingham to buy it. My dad passed away in October and he gave it to me a couple of months before he passed away. It means absolutely everything to me. It's part of my dad. It's a very, very special watch that is and it will be forever.""

The watch was originally sold for £132 and had been accessorised with multiple different straps over the years to make sure it stays in good condition. As viewers and the guest waited with bated breath for its valuation, Richard revealed it could bring in a whopping £20,000.

Clarkson's Farm star Kaleb Cooper took to his Instagram page to share some devastating news with fans and almost broke down in tears as he admitted: 'It's not good'

Clarkson's Farm star Kaleb Cooper received some devastating news this week which he shared with fans on Instagram.

Last month, the farmer - who acts at Jeremy Clarkson's right-hand man in the hit Amazon series filmed at Diddly Squat Farm in the Cotswolds - revealed he had bought a herd of dairy cows. But today he heard the sad news he may lose some of them. Taking to his Instagram stories, Kaleb posted a video in which he told his 2 million followers: ""Now today's a bit stressful. I've just found out the place where I have my dairy cows - the 21 cows that I bought - has got three reactors to TB.""

Fighting back tears as he tried to compose himself, Kaleb let out a huge sigh as he continued: ""I don't really know how to describe the emotion. I know I mean it's not all my cows and I don't know how he [the other owner] feels - but it's hard."" Explaining what would need to happen know, he told fans: ""It's not good. Three reactors, so therefore we've got to test again in two months' time. That's three cows we've lost that are milking."" Clearly stressed by the situation, the young farmer then let out a huge exhale to the camera as he ended his post.

Bovine TB is a respiratory disease caused by bacteria that can be transmitted through nose to nose contact or contact with saliva, urine, faeces and milk, according to the Government website. As well as infecting each other, the disease can be passed on to humans, and usually cattle who have it are slaughtered.

Kaleb will have to wait to see if the infection spreads to his other cows before determining what will happen to the herd. The 25-year-old farming contractor from Chipping Norton won over the hearts of viewers with his passion for work and his hilarious approach to working alongside Diddly Squat Farm owner Clarkson.

He has often spoken out about how tough it is to be a farmer in Britain today and revealed he pays himself just 50p an hour in the wake of Brexit when he is working for himself.

""When I'm working for myself, when I'm feeding my calves, I bought eight calves, it's a little bit of a new business idea that I'm doing,"" he told the Performance People podcast hosted by Ben and Georgie Ainslie. ""And then you feed them on milk which costs me about £200 a calf and then selling them at nine months, trying to get a profit, trying to see if it will work you know. But, I worked out the other day how much my hourly rate is. I pay myself 50p an hour so then I can make money.""

Amazon Prime announced there be a third series of the record-breaking show Clarkson's Farm which is expected to air in 2024 and is thought to be the last.

The video highlights the dire living conditions that animals are forced to live in in China, a country that has been accused of having lax animal welfare standards

A video has surfaced revealing the horrific living conditions that small animals have to suffer inside Chinese fur farms.

The footage shows baby foxes, raccoon dogs and minks forced to live in tiny cages covered in their own filth.

The recording also reveals a baby raccoon dog struggling to walk around its cage, while mink have no choice but to circle their cramped cages.

The video, obtained by the Daily Mirror, was taken by investigators for the Humane Society International (HSI), an animal welfare non-profit organisation, which also saw older animals showing behaviours associated with psychological distress.

Several were seen repeatedly pacing tiny cages barely bigger than their bodies.

According to the HSI, around 100 million animals are killed every year for their fur.

The HSI says while China makes up half of the world's fur trade by animal pelts sold, the European Union follows closely behind - selling around 38 million pelts every year including nearly 230,000 chinchilla furs.

Animals raised for their fur will typically spend their entire lives in small cages, whose often unsanitary conditions leave the animals at a higher risk of catching diseases.

Welfare standards can vary significantly from country to country.

According to World Animal Protection, which runs the Animal Protection Index - a measure of animal welfare standards across the world - China's laws related to the prevention of animal suffering are poor, as is its own accountability for animal welfare.

While fur farming was banned in the UK in 2003, HMRC figures obtained by the Daily Mirror reveal the UK has imported £800million worth of animal furs since the ban was put in place.

Despite the amount of money spent on imported animal furs since fur farming was banned, a 2020 YouGov poll revealed that 72% of Brits supported a total ban on the sale of furs in the UK.

Documentary-makers, who had been investigating sightings across the country, said a recent DNA test has confirmed the existence of black panthers and other big cats living in the UK

DNA from a black hair caught on a barbed wire fence following a sheep attack has offered ""definitive proof"" big cats are roaming the British countryside.

The strands were sent off for testing after being recovered from a farm in Gloucestershire where there had been some ""unusual predatory"" activity.

Suspicion was raised when video footage of a large black animal was also captured only a few miles away from where the sample was taken.

And documentary-makers, who had been investigating sightings across the UK, say the test has now come back ""positive"" and confirmed the existence of black panthers and other big cats living in the UK.

A forensic laboratory took on the species identification task and used mitochondrial DNA analysis to ascertain a 99 per cent match to a big cat species.

The findings have come to light as part of filming for an upcoming documentary - Panthera Britannia Declassified - which investigates claims of big cat sightings in Britain.

Matthew Everett, from Dragonfly Films, said: ""The DNA was from hairs caught on a barbwire fence where there had been some unusual predatory activity.

""It's taken five years for the production team to find such evidence and film its journey from collection to analysis.

""People in Gloucestershire and Britain have described what appear to be black leopards for decades. So, a leopard DNA result from a black hair sample is unsurprising.

""This is not the first such DNA result and is unlikely to be the last.

""There is a great deal of 'secondary evidence' for these cats, such as consistent witness reports, but hard evidence like DNA is hard to get, so the contribution from this documentary is very helpful.

""Collecting such evidence from local people, farmers and landowners is essential - Citizen Science like this will hopefully help us learn more about the Bagheera type big cats which may be quietly naturalising here.""

Residents of countryside towns across Britain have reported sightings of what appear to be black leopards for decades.

Several sightings of a large black cat were reported last year in Gloucestershire - including reports of one on the side of the motorway and another near an airport.

The farm where the DNA sample was recovered has had two individual sheep kill incidents in five years.

During that time there have been regular sightings of cats resembling black leopards in the nearby countryside.

The previous sheep carcass at the same farm as the DNA result, was assessed for its tooth pits, which are marks on the bones from carnassial teeth of an animal that has fed on the carcass.

Tooth pit analysis conducted at the Royal Agricultural University suggests that relatively large carnivores have fed on the carcasses examined, because of the impacted bones.

Witnesses commonly describe black panthers they see as ""healthy"" and ""confident"", which suggests they grew up in their environment.

These cats mainly prey on wild animals like deer, and they have been reported pursuing foxes and even mousing, and going for ducks, geese and pigeons. While they can switch to sheep, it seems that they much prefer natural game.

Dragonfly Films is currently pursuing broadcast options for Panthera Britannia Declassified.

An earlier version of the film ""Panthera Britannia"" available on Amazon Prime, Vimeo and Apple TV.

The tourist hotspot, Chang Mai, in Thailand, is popular among many travellers around the world, but it is now competing against other cities in having the world's worst air quality

A city has been named the worst polluted in the world as its government remains under pressure to declare it a ""disaster zone"".

Chang Mai, in Thailand, has been ranked the worst for air pollution in over 100 cities by the Swiss air quality company, IQAir.

Pollution levels in Thailand are said to be some of the worst as many people are reported falling ill due to the increasing levels.

Much of the pollution has been caused by a dangerous mix of industrial emissions, agricultural burning, and vehicle fumes.

Calls have now been made by campaigners to create stricter legislation to bring the severity of the pollution down.

Weenarin Lulitanonda, the co-founder of the Thailand Clean Air Network, said she believes the new legislation will help immensely.

""This has to be in place to have any chance of fixing a solution"", she said.

Weenarin and others had drafted the citizen-led bill, the 'Thai Clean Air Act', which was submitted to Parliament over a year ago but has not progressed since.

Earlier this week (Tuesday, March 28), many areas of northern Thailand witnessed apocalyptic scenes as a blanket of a thick fog choked many parts - causing nearly 200,000 hospitalisations.

According to IQAir, the thick haze was over 76.3 times over the World Health Organization's annual air quality guideline value.

Many citizens looked for answers, as some hung signs that read ""Save Mae Sai"" around the country.

Weenarin said some people resorted to purchasing face masks, air purifiers and air control monitors but they are not always affordable to everyone.

She added: ""There's huge inequality""

Wiruch Tanchanapradit, the director of the air quality and noise management division at the Bangkok metropolitan assured citizens that there will be regular patrols to provide those with safety equipment.

He said: ""If the dust level reaches level 3 [Bangkok health staff] will start to patrol, going out to provide masks and check on vulnerable groups.""

According to governmental figures, more than 1.32 million people fell ill because of diseases related to air pollution during the first nine weeks of 2023.

In Bangkok, the Capital of Thailand, pollution watch rooms had been set up to show weather patterns and pollution levels.

On severely bad days in the Capital, warning messages are sent through text messages and on social media warning people to not leave their homes and work from home.

Schools controlled by Bangkok authorities use coloured flags to remind children whether it is safer to be outside again.

But campaigners say the mini solutions have not solved a huge bulk of the overall problem.

Many huge companies continue to add to the severe pollution without facing any consequences.

The country is a major producer of sugar cane and rice and sees many farmers every season burn fields to clear land.

Saroj Dokmaisrichan, a sugarcane farmer in Suphan Buri province says he has no other choice.

""If you burn [sugarcane] you don't have the leaves any more. It's easier for the farmer to cut"", he said.

A machine is available to avoid resorting to burning, But Saroj says it's not only slower but expensive for most farmers.

He added: ""It's impossible for them to even buy a secondhand machine.""

Dr Danny Marks, an assistant professor of environmental politics and policy at Dublin City university, said farmers unfairly faced the brunt of the blame for air pollution in Thailand.

Many are trying hard to meet strict deadlines as they are in contracts with major Thai agribusinesses.

More shockingly, smaller factories are not required to report any of the pollutions they produce.

The emissions database documenting the emission profiles of Thailand's 140,000 factories was scrapped after new laws made it not a requirement to reveal data.

Danny said: ""These factory owners, automobile companies, agribusiness owners are basically perpetuating slow violence, particularly on the poorest segments of society.""

More than 150 people in Israel have died after the Hamas group fired thousands of rockets as dozens of fighters infiltrated the heavily fortified border in several locations

Hamas militants were seen being wiped out while attempting to cross the border by sea in shocking footage.

In the thermal camera clip, the Israeli Navy is seen firing explosive rounds at small boats moving at full-throttle. The video shows multiple blasts on the craft as the vehicles are destroyed. The Israeli Defence Force's (IDF) press office said the two crafts were carrying ""dozens of terrorists trying to infiltrate Israel"".

In a statement today, the Israeli Navy said: ""The fighters of the sea arm eliminated dozens of terrorists in the southern maritime space and on the coastline. In the early hours of the morning, the sea arm's fighters conducted a naval pursuit and eliminated dozens of terrorists who tried to reach Israeli territory. The fighters opened fire at them and destroyed two rubber boats, two other vessels and an agricultural tool.""

Hamas, the Palestinian militant movement which governs large parts of Gaza, claimed responsibility for more than 2,000 rockets fired from the Gaza Strip into Israel. The attacks have killed more than 150 Israelis and injured scores more. Fighters infiltrated the heavily fortified border in several locations by air, land and sea, catching the country off guard on a major Jewish holiday.

Israeli authorities say at least 40 people are dead and nearly 800 more wounded in Israel after the early morning surprise attack. The IDF has said Hamas fighters entered southern Israel by land, sea and air, using paragliders.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared his country ""at war"", and vowed that Hamas will ""pay a price it has never known"" for the attack. Speaking in a live TV address today, US President Joe Biden has reiterated his earlier pledge that his country stands with Israel and will ""not ever fail to have their back"".

""We'll make sure they have the help their citizens need and they can continue to defend themselves,"" he said. He added ""thousands of rockets"" have rained down on Israeli cities and Hamas has killed ""innocent"" people.

The leader continued: ""In the face of these terrorist assaults, Israel has the right to defend itself and his people, full stop. There's never justification for terrorist attacks and my administration's support for Israel's security is rock solid and unwavering.""

Bargain Hunt viewers certainly were not happy after an antique item was disqualified from the programme, leaving many to class it as a ""scandal""

Bargain Hunt viewers branded a recent episode a 'scandal' after an antique item was disqualified.

On March 4's episode of the BBC One show, host Natasha Raskin Sharp and the red and blue teams were at Exeter's Westpoint Arena.

The teams were given the challenge to comb for an item that matched very specific criteria.

The blue team, which consisted of mother and son Ann and James, were given the task of finding a maritime object. They bought a menu holder from a shipping liner for £70.

Pals Lisa and Helen were on the red team and had to find something agricultural. They ended up purchasing a mole spade for £18.

Lisa and Helen, along with their expert Philip Serrell, assumed it was a spade for digging out moles but later found out it was probably a bread peel from the 19th century - which wouldn't be part of their criteria.

The host said the Bargain Hunt team also thought it wasn't a mole spade, which meant the red team were disqualified.

After being disqualified, they learned the item sold for £50, giving them a £32 profit.

Viewers were amused by the disqualification and took to social media to comment on the decision.

""Absolute scandal,"" one user said while adding screenshots of the episode.

The user added: ""The way they made them stand there and watch it make a profit. A villain origin story unfolds.""

Another shared their two cents: ""I agree it was an outrageous decision!""

""So petty,"" one user said while another added: ""Natasha seems to relish disqualifying things.""

Bargain Hunt is a guilty pleasure TV show for many people, including celebrities like Louis Tomlinson.

The South Yorkshire-born singer previously discussed enjoying the 'simple things in life' - which include tuning into the BBC antiques show.

When speaking about what he gets up to in a day, Louis admitted he 'rated' Bargain Hunt, adding: ""I'm very good at just watching s*** TV all day.

""But if I'm trying to be productive I like to inspire myself by watching interviews with other artists I admire, like Arctic Monkeys or Liam Gallagher. It's dead interesting hearing the way they think.""

He continued: ""For lunch, I love a tuna sandwich with salad cream ""” not mayo ""” and some prawn cocktail crisps on the side. I'm a s*** cook.

The penguin was discovered with its severed head left next to its body by workers at Rostock Zoo in Germany, with a police investigation now underway to establish how they died

Police say they have launched an investigation after a penguin was found decapitated in a zoo with its severed head left next to its body.

The humboldt penguin was discovered by horrified workers at Rostock Zoo in northern Germany on Tuesday morning after they entered the enclosure for daily cleaning. A bloodied stone was reportedly found next to the animal.

Sources at the zoo told German tabloid Bild the relatively smooth cut on the penguin's head suggested it had not been attacked or killed by another animal. Police have cordoned off the alleged crime scene, and are hoping to establish whether the dead penguin was killed in the same place it was found.

DÃ¶rte Lemke, spokeswoman for Rostock police, told the newspaper: ""Due to the situation in which the Humboldt penguin was found, it cannot currently be ruled out that the animal died as a result of external influence. The investigation of evidence at the site of discovery in the zoo is currently being carried out by the Rostock Criminal Police Office. She added that an autopsy showed that the penguin had ""multiple bite injuries"", and said police were also investigating a potential case of trespassing.

The bird's body has been taken to the German Federal Agency of Agriculture and Food (BLE) for further examination. It is not known why the penguin would have been killed. Rostock Zoo houses 4,500 animals of 450 different species from all over the world, and is located within a large city park. It received a ""Best European Zoo Award"" in 2015 and 2018 within Category II of the competition, which judges zoos with up to a million guests each year.

381,"Russian channel claims Vladimir Putin's death 'imminent' as president 'uses body doubles'","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-channel-claims-vladimir-putins-31151365","Russian channel claims Vladimir Putin's death 'imminent' as president 'uses body doubles'

A Russian Telegram channel claims that Vladimir Putin is on the verge of dying from ill health and body doubles are currently be used to impersonate him in public appearances

Russian leader Vladimir Putin is close to death following a ""sharp deterioration"" in his health, a controversial Telegram channel claims.

Having previously alleged that the president was terminally ill it now says his death is ""imminent"". And the multiple appearances in recent weeks have all been by one or more doppelgÃ¤ngers, states General SVR channel, as the real Putin is too ill to conduct public meetings.

""ŒIt also predicts that the body double will continue in power after Putin dies, so as to hide his demise from ordinary Russians. But his warring aides disagree on who should control the body doubles, lookalikes who have been trained by his FSO secret service as stand-ins for the ""˜ailing' leader.

""ŒWhile Putin, 71, has not nominated an heir, the ""main contender for seizing power"" is his top security aide and former FSB chief Nikolai Patrushev, 72, a hardline war-monger. The theory that Putin is close to death is backed by Russian political analyst Dr Valery Solovey who forecast on camera that the dictator's birthday at the weekend - his 71st - will be his last.

""Œ""The attending doctors predict Putin's imminent death amid a sharp deterioration in his health,"" posted the Telegram channel. ""In the inner circle of Russian President Vladimir Putin, a fuss began with an attempt to create a consensus around the idea of the continuation of the existence of the Putin regime after Putin.

""Œ""There is a general understanding that for some time it is possible to use a double of the president after the death or removal from power of the real Vladimir Putin. Almost all interested parties are ready to rally around a double who can be controlled.""Œ

""The only problem is who will control the double, and this requires mutual trust, which simply does not exist."" According to this version - for which the channel gives no hard proof - Putin's friends favour Patrushev, who earlier angled for his agriculture minister son Dmitry Patrushev, 45, to be the long-term successor.

The unknown factor is the position of the ""security bloc"" which may not want Patrushev senior. Some big players are seeking ""guarantees"" on their future under a new regime.""Œ The constitutional position is that if Putin dies in office, he is replaced for three months by the prime minister, colourless technocrat Mikhail Mishustin, 57, who would become acting president.

""Œ""Putin himself refused to leave any instructions or covenants on what to do after him, preferring to withdraw into himself, and perhaps deciding that the chaos after him is the best legacy,"" said the channel. ""Be that as it may, the end will come very soon. Power in Russia in a crisis situation traditionally goes to the one who turns out to be the most daring.""

Patrushev - who knows the real state of Putin's health - was one of a small group allowed to congratulate him on his 71st birthday, but he was too weak to open many presents, claimed the channel. Solovey said that Putin's real age is two years older but this has been hidden.""Œ

A recent major speech to the Valdai Forum when Putin threatened the West with nuclear weapons was not him but the doppelganger, he said even though it was delivered with the dictator's ""inflamed consciousness"".

""ŒHe claimed this birthday would be his last. ""This news is very simple,"" he said. ""I hope it will be received positively by many, although not by everyone. This is his last birthday on our sinful earth.""

382,"Vladimir Putin 'may already be dead' and Kremlin will soon give major clue, says expert","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-may-already-dead-31293716","Vladimir Putin 'may already be dead' and Kremlin will soon give major clue, says expert

World Affairs expert Anthony Glees says Vladimir Putin could well be dead - and believes if that is the case there are two prime candidates to take over in Russia

Vladimir Putin could very likely already be dead - and we'll start to get clues from the Kremlin very soon, according to a world affairs expert.

Prof Anthony Glees, security and intelligence expert at the University of Buckingham, says a power handover would also potentially see a shift back towards the international community and an end to the Ukraine war. He has named the two most likely candidates to take over from Putin if he has died.

Rumours have been rife for months about the Russian President's declining health, with Telegram channel General SVR claiming he suffered a cardiac arrest at his Moscow home last weekend. The channel claims it has a source inside the 71-year-old dictator's entourage, though the Kremlin swiftly denied he had fallen ill, before further unconfirmed reports claimed Putin had died.

Prof Glees told the Mirror: ""I think we will know very soon. If he has died then the Kremlin will be trying to manage the transition in a seamless and smooth way, so what we can expect over the days ahead are more leaks, more denials, but a gradual sight of rearranging the furniture, slowly beginning to look different. We'll start to hear of other things going on.""

There has been suggestion Putin is suffering with Parkinson's, as well as various forms of cancer, among other ailments. Prof Glees said being in power for around a quarter of a century is a ""fairly amazing feat"" and which is ""likely to cause even the healthiest human being significant stress"". He continued: ""You've then got the things that he's doing, waging this war in Ukraine, which he's not winning, he's clearly not winning - it's clear to everyone. He has to win it in order not to lose it, if you see what I mean.

""The Ukrainians will win it by not losing it but he has got to win it actively and he's not winning it. The latest estimations say about 180,000 Russians have died or been wounded, and it's probably more than that. You add this to the stories that he is ill in some way and the pictures that we have of him, which allow one to be very suspicious of what is actually going on.""

Prof Glees said pictures of Putin in recent months show him looking ""entirely pokerfaced, he can't really move his face at all - which is a symptom of Parkinson's disease"". He also agreed that body doubles are being used, including, in particular, footage of the president supposedly driving a Mercedes over the Kerch Bridge into Crimea.

""Take all these things together, and the Telegram channel, could he already be dead?"" he said. ""Could he have been dead for some time? I think it is not unlikely. I declare an interest, there is nothing that I would like more than for him to be dead because he is a monster but I do realise that that should not colour one's judgement and so I do try not to let it. I think he may already be dead.""

Putin rose up during the Soviet era as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel before resigning in 1991 to begin a political career. Prof Glees described his role as a ""plum job"" and his government has been characterised by the Soviet trait of ""lying consistently about the leadership"".

""As we know from the Lenin mausoleum...They have an almost obsessional interest in keeping dead people alive. If you see Lenin in that mausoleum he looks like a waxwork, look at Putin, he looks like a waxwork,"" he said, laughing. ""Of course, today you wouldn't use embalming fluids, you'd use Artificial Intelligence. It would be very easy, most 15 year old nerds could do some photoshopping.

""The point being, the Soviet state never had any interest in destabilising whatever it was that it was up to at any given moment. The tradition, the obsession with not dying, the need for stability, particularly as the war in Ukraine is going badly, the need for the people who backed Putin to have a Putin there, their world will collapse if Putin is not there. A Kremlin denial is not worth a row of beans. This is a world of whispers, this is a wilderness of mirrors, trying to pick up the reflection. So you then come onto the question of who would replace him if he really was dead?""

Prof Glees said there are two likely candidates to take over from Putin if he has died. They are Ramzan Akhmadovich Kadyrov, Head of the Chechen Republic, and Dmitry Patrushev, Russia's Minister of Agriculture. He described them as the ""only two people who come into the picture"".

He said Patrushev is ""deeply embedded in Putin's system"". He continued: ""He is clearly trusted by Putin. He's quite young, he's 46 years old, he's got that look about him that suggests that he is a likely candidate. On the other hand, you've got that awful Chechen warlord Akhmadovich Kadyrov, who's 47, great big fat freak and killer. He is a thug, a thoroughly nasty piece of work.""

""If there were a coup against Putin, against those people trying to pretend he's not dead or very ill. That would be the Chechen warlord, he's a man of action and has troops behind him. If, on the other hand, what we are seeing a Soviet style transfer of power, the Kremlin are calling the shots, they are framing the narrative, they want to pace it, then I think it's Patrushev.""

Prof Glees said another problem with Kadyrov is there are rumours his health is poor and he has kidney problems, as well as being ""very overweight"". In terms of what is in the best interests of the West, he said Patrushev is ""more likely to be somebody you could do a deal with"".

""If Patrushev has any sense, and he looks to me like he's a smart cookie, he's doing the right things. He's the person the West would like. Kadyrov, on the other hand, he's basically a chaos merchant. He hasn't got the skills that propelled Putin to the top that were recognised early on by the KGB. He's a smart man Putin, he knows how to manipulate people and to buy people off, bribe people. Patrushev knows all this, but Kadyrov is a thug, he only knows how to blow people up.

He continued: ""There's that fear of don't let go of Putin for finding something worse but worse than Putin doesn't exist, he's as bad as you get. Putin is a coldblooded, calculated killer, I don't think Patrushev is and I don't think Kadyrov is coldblooded, I think he's hot blooded, and in the end hot blooded people don't do terribly well.""

Referring to the Ukraine war, he said there's a good chance a new leader brings it to an end. ""Putin is so bogged down in it, it either ends in his victory or his death. One way or another, and it's not going to be his victory, NATO is not going to let him win. It's not going to happen and he's not going to use nuclear weapons, because if he was, he would have done it already.""

Asked how an end to the war could come about and when, if indeed a new leader is brought in shortly, Prof Glees said: ""There's this phrase 'General Winter', the bitter cold in eastern Europe will freeze the fighting more or less where it is. We're not far off that point. It gets colder and colder, and once General Winter hits, that would be a good time to change over. The Russians have got territory, a new leader could barter.

""He wouldn't necessarily have to win, he could say give us a bit and we'll go away. People might lean on Zelensky and say there are one or two places, Crimea is one of them. A deal could be done with a new leader. That would make sense for the West, because if we've got this business in the Middle East to contend with it would be very much in our interests that the Ukraine war comes to an end.""

He added: ""These sanctions are hitting Russia and hitting Russians, the state controlled media says they've got their national identity back but in the end forgive the cliche but 'it's the economy, stupid'. And that applies to Russia as it does to anywhere else. It was the economy that brought the Soviets down, that was it. It was the fact that people couldn't buy stuff and they saw people in the West could buy stuff.

""It's terrible news from the battle front, Ukraine has punched a hole in Russia's three line defences, they are carrying out all these skirmishes on the other side of the river, Biden's giving them all the arms they want. With a new leader you've got a fresh start, we can offer Russia a way back into the community of nations again. You'd have to be stark stirring mad not to go for that. It cannot be done with Putin there, he is so deeply entrenched. But if there's a biological solution to the problem of Putin we should be cheering.""

Referring to when the Kremlin could announce something - if he has died - Prof Glees said: ""Often, history speeds up and gets a kind of convulsion and if there's a big change in China, that might mean the Kremlin will want to be wait and let things settle down. But it can't go on forever, if he has died they'll pick the best time and with the peace of the world hanging by a thread in the Middle East, now is not necessarily the best time. They may let this story run and run but in the end something will come out, there will be more clues.""

Aspartame will be officially listed by the World Health Organization as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"" in a bombshell reclassification of many favourite treats, according to reports

An artificial sweetener found in a lot of our favourite treats - including Diet Coke and chewing gums - is set to be declared a potential cancer risk to humans.

The World Health Organization (WHO) will soon classify aspartame as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"", according to reports.

The chemical is found in many popular products as a sugar substitute such as Diet Coke, Dr Pepper and Fanta, as well as Extra chewing gum and Muller Light yoghurts.

The sweetener entered the market in the 1980s, but the news is likely to change the global food manufacturing market hugely.

Experts have questioned the WHO's decision, which is yet to be confirmed but will reportedly be made public in mid-July.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC) ruling is intended to assess whether something is a potential hazard or not, based on all the published evidence.

It does not take into account how much of a product a person can safely consume.

Professor Oliver Jones, an expert in chemistry at the RMIT University in Melbourne, said: ""It is also important to note that just because something may possibly cause cancer does not mean that it automatically does if you are exposed to it.

""The dose makes the poison. For example we know UV light in sunlight causes cancer, that's why we put on sunscreen at the beach - but we don't put on sunscreen when we go outside in winter even though we are still exposed to sunlight, why? Because the dose is lower in winter.""

Consumption advice for individuals comes from a separate expert committee on food additives, known as the Joint WHO and Food and Agriculture Organisation's Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), alongside national regulators.

JECFA is also reviewing aspartame use this year.

Its meeting began at the end of June and it is due to announce its findings on the same day that the IARC makes public its decision ""” on July 14, it was claimed.

Since 1981, the JECFA has said aspartame is safe to consume within accepted daily limits.

For example, an adult weighing 60kg (132lbs) would have to drink between 12 and 36 cans of diet soda ""” depending on the amount of aspartame in the beverage ""” every day to be at risk.

Its view has been widely shared by national regulators, including in the US and Europe.

An IARC spokesman said that both the IARC and JECFA committees' findings were confidential until July.

But they added they were 'complementary', with IARC's conclusion representing ""the first fundamental step to understand carcinogenicity"".

Creepy webs have been draped all over the bushes of a beautiful historic country estate, leaving staff stunned by the invasion of white ermine moth caterpillars

Creepy ""ghostly"" caterpillar webs have smothered the garden of a 17th-century country estate.

An invasion of white ermine moth caterpillars has resulted in what looks like a horror movie scene, with thick layers of white web covering the garden bushes.

It left staff shocked after seeing the thick webs in the garden of the 1,000-acre Courteenhall Estate in Northamptonshire.

Head Groundsman Darron Wilks described the scene as ""dramatic and a bit ghostly,"" with the webs ""especially abundant in our spindle bushes this year.""

The webs, which can hold hundreds of caterpillars, are spun to protect caterpillars from predators as they transform into moths.

Ermine moths can be minor agricultural pests, and consist of several hundred species mostly found in the tropics.

They are white with distinctive black spots and a wingspan of up to 31mm, and once matured fly around at night between June and September.

Wilks added: ""The caterpillars have created a spectacular art display and everyone who sees it does a double take.

""We're looking forward to watching them transform into white ermine moths over the coming weeks and they will be great food for the birds and the bats on the estate.""

Courteenhall Estate has belonged to the Wake family since 1672, with the Hall built in 1791.

Friends fans have recently noticed an awkward blunder in the sitcom after rewatching and it's all to do with Hollywood actor Brad Pitt who stars in an episode in season 8

When it comes to Friends, fans of the show have spent years scrutinising every small detail of every episode to find mistakes and little moments they'd never noticed before.

Many of these have gone viral, as fans spotted actresses seemingly changing places during scenes, stars being replaced by body doubles and filming equipment accidentally cropping up in shots.

And now it seems there's another little blunder that eagle-eyed fans have spotted, all to do with a guest star from season 8 of the show.

In a post on the How You Doin forum on Reddit, a viewer shared a look at a still from season four, episode 9, The One Where They're Going To Party.

The image shows a newsstand on the street filled with magazines and on the cover of one is Hollywood star Brad Pitt.

Pitt is known by Friends fans for his appearance in the season 8 episode The One with the Rumour.

His role on the show was as Will Colbert, a broker, who went to high school with Ross and Monica and started an I hate Rachel club, before initiating a cruel rumour about Jennifer Aniston's character.

Fans who spotted his image on the magazine cover thought it was awkward that he was seen in the show before his character had been introduced.

Writing on Reddit, they said: ""Brad Pitt spotted in a magazine before his cameo as broker 'Will Colbert'"".

Other fans were quick to point out that this wasn't the only time an actor had been referenced or seen on the show, before they made a guest appearance.

In the comments, one person said: ""So both Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis (the guys talk about how much they love Die Hard) both canonically exist in the Friends universe, but the characters never acknowledge Will nor Elizabeth's dad as their celebrity lookalikes.""

Another said: ""Same with Winona Ryder!""

A third joked that they were just ""doppelgÃ¤ngers"", adding: ""They look like said celebrities but they're their own people!""

While a different user was just in awe that someone noticed in the first place, praising the poster for their ""good eyes"".

The Landmann Triton Maxx 3.1 three burner gas BBQ is 'worth every penny'

It's barbecue hunting time in the UK with many of us starting to panic we need to prep for the glorious summer months now just around the corner.

Large retailers are giving shoppers a head start with plenty of Spring sales cropping up, whether it be barbecues, the next viral rattan furniture set or an egg chair to enjoy your morning brew, there are so many offers available right now if you have a good rummage online.

The likes of Landmann, Dunelm and Aldi have all released their Spring sales, with plenty of items to help us all save some cash when spending during the cost of living crisis.

Writer Bethan Shufflebotham trialled a barbecue from Landmann's sale (reduced from £549.99 to £412.49), and with such a huge reduction it was worth testing out it's many incredible features to see if it is worth the price tag.

Here's Bethan's thoughts.

Our home has always been the hosting venue for family barbecues thanks to our sizable garden. And they really are the highlight of my summer, having everyone round for a few cocktails and a burger or two with music playing on the Echo Dot.

So when meeting up to socialise was illegal during the pandemic, our throng of 10-15 family members and five dogs in the garden quickly dwindled to my parents and I, with our two greedy Staffordshire crosses begging for an overcooked sausage. It took the sparkle out of it quite a bit.

It hit my mum pretty hard, really, not being able to have my siblings round to host them for tea, along with their partners, children and pets, nor could my boyfriend just pop round for a bite to eat.

This summer is the first where everything really feels back to ""˜normal' for the most part, without restrictions or caveats of social distancing. But our barbecue had taken a bit of a battering having been abandoned up the corner of the garden for 18 months.

We've probably spent a small fortune on barbecues over the years, £100 one year, £150 the next, because they just don't seem to hold up too well in the frost or rain, with strong winds and storms bowing poorly made legs in on themselves.

But to welcome the warmer weather, celebrate the return of family garden parties, and enjoy some al fresco dining, we've now got a Landmann barbecue I'm convinced will outlive me, so we'll never need to buy another barbecue again.

The Triton Maxx 3.1 - 3 burner gas BBQ is at a great price point now at just £412.49, while in the last five years or so, we've probably spent the same on cheap charcoal barbecues that inevitably end up in the back of a scrap van.

It arrived in a huge box, I half hoped it would be pretty much set up and ready to go, but despite wishful thinking, it took my dad around four hours to leisurely put it together. With help from a second pair of hands, it could have been done in around two, he thought.

He built most of the Landmann inside the house before carrying it outside to add the cupboard doors and side pieces.

Once it was all set up, mum, dad and I headed into the garden to admire my pops' handiwork, and the Triton Maxx 3.1 BBQ really is a thing of beauty. It's undeniably impressive and really looks the part - I'd say it actually looks more expensive than it's original £549.99 price tag.

The barbecue offers some pretty impressive features you simply don't get with bod-standard charcoal barbecues, with three adjustable stainless steel burners with automatic ignition to allow for the alteration of cooking speed and temperature.

Once we'd figured out the type of gas bottle we needed for the kit, it was easy to attach and fire up, ready to christen it with its first burger of the season.

We set the barbecue up on the patio and allowed it to heat up before we started laying down meats. There's a thermometer on the front of the double skinned hood of the barbecue which lets you know when it's ready to go while the lid itself retains heat within the BBQ.

Lifting the lid, grillers can find a cast-iron grill, which Landmann say are more durable, cook faster and retain heat longer. They added: ""It distributes it [heat] more evenly, food sticks to it less and it's an all-round better grilling experience.""

As we were testing the BBQ for it's first run, it was just the four of us dining in the garden on this occasion - my parents, my partner, Jake, and myself - with the two dogs still very much begging for scraps.

We'd been to Aldi to pick up the essentials, including four burgers, eight sausages, bacon, cheese halloumi and added extras such as pickled gherkins and sauces. We placed the meat straight onto the cast iron grill, which has enamel coated steel flame tamers below to protect food from getting burned if fat drips onto the burners while cooking, and put the halloumi on some tin foil and drizzled it with honey.

The BBQ has a stainless-steel infra-red side burner which Landmann say is ""˜ideal for searing steak to perfection', but we also thought it would be handy to save it for diners with allergies or dietary requirements, as my niece and nephew both have dairy allergies, while my sister is vegan, meaning we can keep their food totally separate.

The food all cooked surprisingly quickly, but evenly. In other words, we weren't all standing around holding empty plates asking dad when the burgers were done, because they only took about 7 minutes to cook. We popped them on the enamel coated steel warming rack while the sausages, bacon and halloumi finished off

The family all enjoyed a plate of freshly cooked food from the barbecue, all of which was perfectly done, alongside salad, onions and added extras.

Cleaning the barbecue was really easy with a removable fat tray, and what's more is that because it's gas, our clothes and the laundry that was hanging out to try didn't smell like a bonfire either.

The Landmann - which comes with a five year warranty - was an absolute dream to cook on, and certainly won't blow away in the next storm. While it was a hefty £549.99 before it's impressive sale price of £412.49 - still, it's worth every penny. It's big enough to cook for around eight people, should you be throwing on sausages, burgers, lamp chops and more meaning guests won't have to wait too long to get their helping, making it ideal for big families or those who love to entertain.

You can get the barbecue for £412.49 at Landman, which is the cheapest we've seen it on offer.","https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29626295.ece/ALTERNATES/n615/0_BBQ-1.jpg","Landmann Triton Maxx 3.1 three burner gas BBQ",4,TRUE,FALSE

Dr Johannes Uys, of Broadgate General Practice, has revealed that the Pirola coronavirus variant can cause irritation to your face - he explained why it differs from other variants

A doctor has shared the two facial changes that can be caused by the Pirola Covid-19 variant.

Dr Johannes Uys, of Broadgate General Practice, has revealed the additional symptoms affect your eyes and skin. His remarks come after new reports shined light on the variant's differentiating factors compared to its predecessors.

The GP explained the symptoms arised after Pirola began to evolve to keep up with other circulating strains such as Eris. ""Unlike most previous variants, Covid Pirola can cause visible facial symptoms such as eye irritation and a skin rash,"" he said. These new symptoms have been found in people who have caught the Omicron variant.

Apart from rash and eye irritation, reports also suggest that patients with Pirola struggle with diarrhoea. Another symptom that seems to play a ""huge part"" in the strain is fatigue, according to Dr Nighat Arif. Speaking on ITV 's show This Morning, she said: ""We're seeing people who are just feeling shattered.""

Despite new symptoms cropping up, Dr Uys explained that Pirola isn't more dangerous than other versions of the virus, reports Express. The GP said: ""In fact, your chances of becoming seriously ill are about the same, and most people make a full recovery with time and rest.""

However, if you notice any of these new symptoms, Dr Uys recommended distancing yourself from others until you take a test. The doctor added: ""It's always best to err on the side of caution and avoid close contact with others until you've taken a test to confirm whether you have Covid.

""If the test comes back positive, you would ideally self-isolate for the duration of the infection while the virus runs its course. If the symptoms are severe and you struggle to breathe, you should seek emergency medical care.""

Professor Stephen Griffin shared his views regarding the spread of Perola. He previously told the Mirror: ""It's obviously successful because it's spread round the world, it's only just emerged into people we know that ""¦ so it's managed to spread round the world very quickly against the background of hugely successful Omicron XBB variants. The idea that it'll burn out could happen, but I suspect it won't ""¦ if you look back, the delta variant was quite similar at the beginning and it had fits and starts, before it really got going.

One of the biggest shows on TV has only been back a short time but fans are already predicting who is going to win Winter Love Island 2023 based on their lookalikes from previous seasons

The appeal of Love Island for the masses cannot be understated with more than a million viewers tuning in to watch the latest season with new host Maya Jama pulling lots of attention herself.

Already, fans are picking favourites and guessing who will make it to the end and possibly win the £50,000 cash prize. Many have spotted a pattern with this years line up when compared to previous seasons - there are contestants who look eerily like past winners.

So the real question is can fans actually predict this year's Love Island winner - and losers - based on the fate of their lookalikes?

Discover, learn, grow. We are Curiously. Follow us on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

While the show has only just kicked off and things are still settling in Love Island villa, fans have pointed out that a few of the woman look a lot like last year's winner Ekin-Su.

One name cropping up a lot is Tanyel, with fans tweeting: ""Tanyel looks like Ekin-Su"" or that she is ""a mix of faye and ekin-su"". Whether due to her similarity to Ekin-Su or her winning personality on the show, she seems to be a fan favourite already.

One viewer said: ""Tanyel and Kai r going to win this bffr"" while another tweeted: ""Tanyel can stay single and she will still win"".

A third fan gave a more in depth reasoning, saying: ""I think Tanyel has the best personality in the villa, she's level headed and not up herself. She's intelligent as well, always a bonus. Hope she wins!!""

With things just starting to heat up on the winter version of the show, anything could happen but if Tanyel produces half the amount of iconic moments as Ekin-Su then their resemblance certainly won't hurt.

On the flip side of this, it could also indicate who may leave early too and the tide has already begun to turn against farmer Will who is reminiscent of last year's Charlie.

Unfortunately for Will, Charlie failed to find love and left after only eight days - with a week left to go who knows if Will will suffer the same fate.

Fans are currently split on farmer Will, with some finding his dancing endearing and others cringing at his recently surfaced TikToks - many were comparing him to season four's Dr Alex.

One viewer tweeted: ""Farmer Will gotta go home at the earliest opportunity, I'm not tolerating another Dr Alex/Hugo arch. At least last year that other boy had the dignity to pack his bags himself.""

Another disagreed and said: ""I'm so sad for farmer Will. He's actually such a sweetheart. Just here for dorky dancing, quirky outfits & a fun time. Someone give him a chance! Not suited for this show I fear. He doesn't have the heart for it.""

The only requirements for Love Island applicants is that they must be over 18, single and free to film the full series, meaning any lookalikes are likely a total coincidence.

Our brain does like to search for patterns though so if we see similarities to previous winners then we may start to subconsciously root for certain people.

Nike and Tiffany & Co's collaboration was one of the most hotly anticipated trainer drops but resellers have beat customers to the punch, selling them for quadruple the price

Big brand collaborations don't come much bigger than behemoths Nike and Tiffany & Co coming together for a version of Nike's iconic Air Force 1 trainer.

Featuring Tiffany's trademark blue in the Nike swoosh tick, the Tiffany x Nike Air Force 1 ""1837"" trainers have other detailing such as embroidered ""Tiffany's"" written across the tongue and a sterling silver decal on the back.

At first fans were underwhelmed by the collaboration but for collectors and lovers of the brands, this was a much anticipated drop with a limited number of the ""legendary pair"" made.

Unsurprisingly, the trainers sold out almost instantly but fans have noticed they're already cropping up elsewhere online.

Discover, learn, grow. We are Curiously. Follow us on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.



The collaboration went live on March 7 at 8am through Nike's SNKRS app and website as fans rushed to get their hands on the rare trainers. New York shoppers could pop into Tiffany's Fifth Avenue or Soho stores to get a pair but UK fans were reliant on the app.

Originally retailing for £359.95, eagle eyed fans have spotted reseller sites flogging the limited edition trainers for over £1k.

Popular UK based sneaker retailer The Sole Supplier listed three separate reselling sites with the collaboration, all for a minimum of £1,403, over £1k more than the original retail price.

These reselling sites appear to have multiple sizes of the trainers, despite Nike's limit of one per customer, which has lead fans to suggest they used bots to get around Nike's raffle system and purchase large batches of the trainers - of which only 1,837 were made in tribute to the year Tiffany's was founded.

One disappointed customer tweeted: ""What f's me off is several sites are now selling Nike x Tiffany for between £1,267 and £2,325. Come on Nike sort it out, if I start to buy theatre tickets I have 10 mins to complete the transaction and they are held for me, the tech is out there!""

Some also complained that at point of purchase, the website glitched and booted them out or removed trainers from their cart, causing them to miss out on the exclusive pair.

For fans who were left disappointed by this batch could be in for a treat as Erling Haarland, striker for Manchester City, posted a snap of himself wearing some Air Force 1s that looked to be the inverse of the Tiffany collaboration.

The all over Tiffany blue is complimented with a black Nike swoosh, although this could be exclusive for Nike ambassadors as Haarland is rumoured to have signed a deal with the sports brand.

Collectors can still get their hands on the sterling silver accessories that came as part of the collaboration, including a silver shoe horn that retails for $425 - although these don't appear to be available in the UK.

Tomatoes have been amongst the worst affected by the recent shortages in the UK as Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Tesco all introduced limits on the product

Brits could face tomato-free pizzas and pasta as fruit and veg shortages see prices skyrocket.

The last week has seen a number of supermarkets introduce limits on the amount of fruit and vegetables Brits can buy.

After poor weather across southern Spain, and Morocco, areas the UK relies on for imports, produce supplies to the UK were severely disrupted.

This was exacerbated by the fact some farmers have chosen to leave greenhouses empty as fuel prices remain high.

Now Brits reportedly might be stuck with tomato-less pizzas and pasta as restaurants are forced to ration the veg, or cut back entirely due to high prices.

The head of the Federazione Italian Cuochi UK (FIC UK), a chefs' association, told The Guardian that some Italian restaurants were already changing their menus and offering tomato-less alternatives.

He said chefs were turning to white pizzas or using vegetables like courgettes or aubergines as a base for pasta sauces instead.

The FIC UK president claimed the price of some tomatoes has quadrupled over the past year from £5 a case to £20, badly impacting restaurants.

Tomatoes have been amongst the worst affected by the recent shortages as Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Tesco all introduced limits on the product.

The chefs' association also claimed the price of canned tomatoes has doubled from £15 a case to £30 and that cooks were even feeling the pinch as iceberg lettuces had risen from around £7 a box to £22, the outlet reported.

Mr Oliveri also told the Guardian he couldn't ""see any light at the end of the tunnel"".

Whilst some restaurant owners have found themselves forced to up their prices, others have said supplies of other tomato-based products like passata have also dropped off.

This comes after a week which saw empty supermarket shelves and product limits as the government is now set to haul supermarket bosses in to explain the problems.

Asda introduced a limit of three items each on packs of tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflower and raspberries.

Meanwhile Morrisons had a limit of two items per customer for tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, and peppers.

Tesco and Aldi both introduced three per customer limits on peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes as well.

Speaking on Times Radio, Tom Bradshaw, the deputy president of the National Farmers' Union (NFU), said the current shortages might just be the ""tip of the iceberg"".

He said: ""We've been warning about this moment for the past year. The tragic events in Ukraine have driven inflation, particularly energy inflation to levels that we haven't seen before.

""There's a lack of confidence from the growers that they're going to get the returns that justify planting their glasshouses, and at the moment we've got a lot of glasshouses that would be growing the tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, aubergine that are sitting there empty because they simply couldn't take the risk to plant them with the crops, not thinking they'd get the returns from the marketplace.

""And with them being completely reliant on imports - we'd always have some imports - but we've been completely reliant on imports (now).

""It's really interesting that before Brexit we didn't used to source anything, or very little, from Morocco but we've been forced to go further afield and now these climatic shocks becoming more prevalent have had a real impact on the food available on our shelves today.""

Elon Musk has helped launch a new secretive space craft for the US military. But very few details are available about what the confidential mission actually aims to do

Elon Musk's SpaceX has launched a mystery new space plane for the US military - shrouded in secrecy.

SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket launched into the skies on Thursday night from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The rocket is carrying the X-37B space plane belonging to the military - who aren't confirming where it is going or what it is doing as it blasted off on a secretive mission expected to last several years.

The unmanned space plane is on its seventh mission and this time will be taken into higher orbit than ever before thanks to the capabilities of Falcon Heavy. But lift-off happened two weeks late, with three earlier scheduled countdowns abandoned as a result of unspecified technical issues and poor weather. The reusable plane resembling a mini space shuttle carries highly classified experiments. There's no one on board and it is not clear exactly where the space plane is going.

The X-37B resembles the space shuttles formerly retired by NASA, but they are far smaller at just 29 feet long and do not require an astronaut to man it, due to its autonomous landing system according to ABC7. The spacecraft lands horizontally like planes and can orbit between 150 miles to 500 miles high. The Falcon Heavy which transported the spacecraft is made up of three rocket cores all strapped together.

It has been 13 years since the X-37B was debuted in 2010, with the latest flight lasting a long two and a half years before the spacecraft landed on a Kennedy runway one year ago. The current X-37B mission is being conducted by the US Space Force under the national security space launch programme set out by the military. It is expected the X-37B mission will last until around June 2026 if not longer, if following the pattern of longer flights each time.

It took off aboard SpaceX's hulking Falcon Heavy rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Centre under the cover of night on Thursday more than two weeks late because of technical issues. It marked the seventh flight of an X-37B, which has logged more than 10 years in orbit since its debut in 2010. The last flight, the longest one yet, lasted two and a half years before ending on a runway at Kennedy a year ago.

But details are scarce on the mission, with the Pentagon not even revealing how high the space plane will be flying. It revealed that there will be tests of ""new orbital regimes, experimenting with future space domain awareness technologies"" - which they revealed in a statement last month.

The space plane is reportedly also carrying an experiment to look at how plant seeds are affected by exposure to radiation in space in order to learn more about cultivating crops in space. This NASA research is vital for future long-term missions to the moon and even Mars.

China recently launched a similarly secretive space mission, sending their own robot space plane known as Shenlong (or ""˜Divine Dragon'). Shenlong is on its third mission since 2020 after being carried into space on December 14 by the Long March 2F rocket, which isn't as powerful as the Falcon Heavy.

Space Force General B Chance Saltzman said it was a competitive move claiming its ""no surprise"" that the Chinese are ""extremely interested in our space plane"", adding that the US is ""extremely interested in theirs"". In quotes given to US aerospace journal Air & Space Forces Magazine, he added: ""These are two of the most watched objects on orbit while they're on orbit. It's probably no coincidence that they're trying to match us in timing and sequence of this.""

Space Force officials would not say how long this orbital test vehicle would remain aloft or what's on board other than a NASA experiment to gauge the effects of radiation on materials.

Built by Boeing, the X-37B resembles NASA's retired space shuttles. But they're just one-fourth the size at 29 feet (9 meters) long. No astronauts are needed; the X-37B has an autonomous landing system. They take off vertically like rockets but land horizontally like planes and are designed to orbit between 150 miles and 500 miles high.

There are two X-37Bs based in a former shuttle hangar at Kennedy.

Kim Ju-ae, believed to be around 10 years old, was photographed with her father Kim Jong-un at Pyongyang International Airport in North Korea in a four-digit priced hoodie

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's daughter wore a velvet hoodie by Christian Dior worth nearly over £1k when she witnessed a missile launch with her dictator dad.

Kim Ju-ae, believed to be around 10 years old, was photographed with her father at the site on March 16, according to footage released by North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency.

Beady-eyed followers noticed her plush patterned hoodie as she watched the launch of the Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile at Pyongyang International Airport.

The South Korean news outlet The Choson Ilbo reported that Ju-ae appeared to be wearing the four-digit priced hoodie but it's unclear whether or not it's a fake.

If it's real Dior, though, Ju-ae would be wearing a jacket that costs over the per capita income in North Korea as it stands at £1,300 on the door UK website.

""The hooded down jacket honours House heritage with the iconic Cannage motif,"" Dior says on the jacket's product page.

Kim Ju-ae's mother, Ri Sol Ju, is known for her taste in luxury and she has been photographed before carrying purses which look like designer brands such as Dior and Chanel.

Consumption by the ruling family is at odds with North Korea's socialist ideology and is officially banned under United Nations sanctions, but members of North Korea's elite continue to defy the sanctions.

""Outsiders tend to think fashion in North Korea is frumpy and outdated, but North Korea's elite are up to date with new style trends,"" Joung Eun-lee, a researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul told the Washington Post.

Since November, Ju-ae has made seven public appearances and North Korea also issued stamps depicting her and her father at the test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile.

Many think this is the leader preparing her to succeed him as head of the world's only hereditary communist dictatorship.

The high price tag of her clothes is a stark contrast to the conditions in which North Koreans are currently living as they face a famine.

Satellite imagery from South Korean authorities shows that the North produced 180,000 tonnes less food in 2022 than in 2021.

In June, the World Food Programme raised concerns that extreme weather conditions like drought and flooding could reduce the production of both winter and spring crops.

The price of corn has risen 20% at the start of 2023 and the country is ranked one of the poorest countries in the world.

Some experts say the country has hit its worst point since a 1990s famine known as the ""Arduous March"" which caused mass starvation and killed hundreds of thousands of people.

The Cordyceps brain infection, which turns humans into mushroom-headed zombies in HBO's The Last of Us, is based on a real-life fungus that takes over its victims' minds

The Last of Us' has been terrifying viewers - but the truly horrifying reality is that the show's deadly zombie fungi does actually exist.

Based on the much-loved video game of the same name, the HBO series transports us to a world where a parasitic fungi has turned most of the world's population into mushroom-headed zombies.

Game of Thrones stars Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey play Joel and Ellie, who are trying to avoid being infected as society collapses around them.

The popular series might be fiction, but the scary Cordyceps brain infection is very much real.

At the start of the very first episode of series 1, John Hannah's character (Dr Neuman) claims that mankind's biggest threat is from a fungal infection.

He's laughed at by the presenter and the audience, but the show then flashes forward to 2003, where a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus is spread to humans through infected crops.

The fungus grows while the human host is still alive and can be spread through biting or disgusting tendrils that emerge from the mouth.

In the video game, it's even bleaker as the infected can burst and release spores that can also get into humans, but this was cut from the TV show so the actors didn't have to wear face masks all the time.

In our real world, the same fungus does turn its victims into zombies, but thankfully it doesn't happen to humans...yet.

The Last of Us' was actually inspired by a clip from BBC's Planet Earth, in which David Attenborough explains how Cordyceps spores infiltrate the bodies and minds of ants.

The disorientated ants are driven upwards by their infected brains, then they grip hold of a steam with their mandibles before a gruesome tendril erupts from their head.

When finished growing, which can take up to three weeks, deadly spores burst out to infect any ants in the vicinity, and can wipe out whole colonies.

It's not just a killer for ants, as there are thousands of different types of Cordyceps fungi - with each specialising on just one species.

The attacks do have a positive effect on the jungle's diversity, as they stop any one group of animal gaining the upper hand.

""The more numerous a species becomes, the more likely it will be attacked by its nemesis, the Cordyceps fungus,"" says Attenborough.

It sounds like humans should be well overdue an attack, but the good news for us is that it's highly unlikely to make the leap from insects.

Dr Charissa de Bekker, a microbiologist at Utrecht University, has studied how Cordyceps creates zombified ants and doesn't think it will ever have the same impact on humans.

""Our body temperature is simply too high for most fungi to nicely settle and grow - and this is the same for this Cordyceps,"" she told the BBC.

""Their nervous system is simpler than ours, so it would definitely be easier to hijack the brain of an insect versus our brain, also their immune systems are very different from ours.

""For this fungus to be able to jump from an insect to us and cause an infection is a very big leap.""

However, it's not all good news, as the World Health Organization (WHO) issued its first list of life-threatening fungi in October last year.

Fungi kill around 1.7 million people a year, about three times as many as malaria, and the WHO has identified 19 types which they think are a significant worry.

Mucormycetes, also known as black fungus, causes the flesh-eating disease mucormycosis which can be fatal or leave humans severely disfigured.

It is rare in humans, but there was an explosion of black fungus in India during the Covid pandemic, with more than 4,000 people dying.

Candida auris is a a yeast-type fungus which has suddenly emerged and is estimated to kill half of the people who are invasively infected.

It's considered a superbug because it naturally shrugs off anti-fungal drugs and some strains are resistant to all of the medicines we have.

Fungal diseases are harder to treat than bacterial infections because they share the same basic cell structures of humans, making it difficult to find a treatment that targets the fungus and not us.

The fungal infection in The Last of Us happens because of global warming - and it is the reason why Candida auris can now be found in more than 30 countries.

""In a warming world, fungi also have to adapt to a warmer climate,"" de Bekker told CNN.

""And you can imagine then, if their optimal growth temperatures therefore become higher and closer to our body temperatures, it might be more likely that in the future, we have more fungal infections in humans than we see right now.""

A warmer future with more fungal infections would especially endanger people with weakened immune systems, Kontoyiannis added

Series showrunner, Craig Mazin, has spoken about how the fungus exists in the real world - and how he doubts it will ever have such a dramatic impact on the human races.

""It's real ""” it's real to the extent that everything he says that fungus do, they do,"" Mazin told The Hollywood Reporter.

""And they currently do it and have been doing it forever. There are some remarkable documentaries that you can watch that are quite terrifying.

""Now his warning ""” what if they evolve and get into us? ""” from a purely scientific point of view, would they do exactly to us what they do to ants? I don't think so. I doubt it.

""On the other hand, he's right ""” LSD and psilocybin do come from fungus. What I told John [Hannah] was, 'What we're doing in this scene is telling people this has always been here.'""

Thankfully, we don't have to worry about mushroom-headed zombies just yet - and fans of the new series will be excited to know it's already been renewed for a second season.

Hollywood has struggled to take games from our consoles and turn them into movies and TV shows, but The Last of Us has managed to buck the trend.

The Last of Us was watched by 4.7 million viewers on TV and HBO Max streaming on the night it premiered, with that number going up to 5.7 million for episode 2.

That 22 percent increase was the largest second-week growth in HBO's history, so it wasn't a tough decision for the network.

Another thing we don't need to be concerned about is the Game of Thrones-esque issues with ending the story.

Executive producer Neil Druckman explained that they already have the full storyline in place thanks to the games - and don't plan to deviate from the plot.

""We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games,"" Druckmann previously told The Hollywood Reporter.

""We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since Part II doesn't end on a cliffhanger.""

Little Nasro, two, is so dehydrated she cannot produce tears. For seven long days her devoted mother Samiro has kept a bedside vigil at a hospital in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital

Hungry and helpless ...this is Nasro, the baby who is unable to cry.

The two-year-old is so dehydrated she cannot produce tears. Nasro is among four million facing crisis levels of hunger in wartorn Somalia. Her mum Samiro tells us: ""She hasn't smiled in months.""

Helpless Nasro lays a hand across her head and lets out a plaintive cry... yet she physically can't shed a tear. The malnourished toddler is too gripped by dehydration. She hasn't smiled in months. Her gaunt frame tips the scales at barely more than a stone - just twice the weight of an average newborn.

For seven long days her devoted mother Samiro has kept a bedside vigil at the intensive care unit in Banadir Hospital's stabilisation centre in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital. Nasro is fed via a nasal tube. Samiro, 25, tells us: ""Every time when I was with my daughter day and night I was praying for her to recover""¦ I don't sleep. The last time I saw her smiling was June. Since then she was feeling dizzy, sick.""

Nasro's plight encapsulates the pain of an entire nation. The impoverished country in East Africa has been ravaged by decades of war and the Islamist terror group Al-Shabaab controls vast swathes of territory. But an old and equally deadly threat has returned: Drought... leading to crippling hunger.

A catastrophe is unfolding before the world's eyes. Crops have failed, livestock has perished. As countries around the globe grapple with the impact of the climate crisis, Somalia has endured its worst drought on record.

Research has found climate change has increased the severity of drought in the Horn of Africa. It is estimated such droughts have become 100 times more likely. After a summer of wildfires across Europe, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has controversially watered down key UK climate policies.

But wartorn Somalia - responsible for a tiny fraction of global emissions - appears to be bearing the brunt of climate change. And, as the world burns, this fragile nation's children are on the frontline. Somalia has battled three major droughts in the past 12 years. This year's wet season saw above average rain in March and April.

But it dried up in early May and it is the legacy of drought which continues to leave Somalia cruelly exposed. Some 1.5million kids under the age of five are estimated to be facing face acute malnutrition by next July - and some 330,630 could be severely malnourished.

The latest figures come from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a multi-partner initiative. And they make for grim reading. Some 4.3 million people, a fourth of the population, are expected to experience crisis levels of hunger, or worse, between now and December - up from 3.7 million in just one year.

The very worst effects of famine may have been averted but disaster, it seems, is still at Somalia's door. Perched on the hospital bed next to her daughter, mother-of-six Samiro tells how she left Buur Hakaba, in the country's southern bay region, last year. She tells us: ""One of the major reasons I fled was mainly because of lack of water and through hunger.""

Nasro previously had measles as well as acute diarrhoea and vomiting. For two days, she was unconscious. A sibling, aged three, is on another ward being treated for diarrhoea. Yards away, a mum named Yasmin, 23, cradles her critically ill daughter Filsan, aged two-and-a-half.

The poor mite softly cries as a medic checks her over. As well as severe malnutrition, she has sepsis, dehydration and gastroenteritis. Brought to the hospital days earlier, Filsan's health is improving with treatment but her situation remains desperate. Fortunately, the numbers are on her side. The hospital's stabilisation centre, which treats up to 300 kids a month, has a 95% recovery rate.

Yasmin travelled to Mogadishu from Jowhar - farming territory, north of the capital. Drought ruined their livelihood. Armed with just $12, Yasmin made the journey to the capital to seek treatment for her daughter. She has four children and left some of them behind to be cared for by her mother. And Yasmin is so grateful for the help Filsan has received.

She says: ""I feel a lot of stress, a lot of anxiety. I have that worry all the time that she's not feeling well. At the same time, I also think back [about] the children I left. When we came in here, Filsan was in an emergency situation but after a lot of support by the medical staff, she is recovering and her case is becoming now good.""

An estimated 43,000 people died in Somalia last year due to the drought. Half of them were children under the age of five, according to an Imperial College study published in March. The fragile nation has been here before. A famine in 2011 killed more than a quarter of a million people.

Mogadishu has more than 2,000 camps which are home to more than a million internally displaced people. At one camp we met Mulki, a 20-year-old who has endured enough sorrow for a lifetime. Holding her nine-month old close while her three-year-girl stands dutifully by her side, Mulki tells how she has lost two children. A daughter, aged two, had heart issues and died four months ago.

Too poor to afford a burial, the family relied on the generosity of others. Another child died shortly after being born. The family has been at the ramshackle camp for five months. Mulki's husband is with her and home is a dusty clearing with tents - one where they sleep and another with cooking equipment. The family fled from Balcad, north-east of the capital, seeking sanctuary from conflict - a familiar tale. Mulki says: ""[There were] serious conflict issues and also we lost animals because of the droughts.

""We had farms to cultivate... [but they] dried... we could not survive. We used to rent farms. But due to having no money to rent those farms we could not afford to survive and get food. As well, because of too much conflict going on and having nowhere to get food from, we had a lot of hunger.""

Save the Children is channelling funds to stricken countries via its Global Hunger Crisis campaign (inset, above). Mohamud Mohammed Hussain, the charity's Country Director for Somalia, said: ""Yes, rains brought some relief this year and because of sustained humanitarian assistance, the famine was averted last year. But failure of the rains in successive seasons, plus the ongoing conflict in Somalia, plus other things like conflict in Ukraine, this has really slowed down the community recovery.

""Usually when there is a severe drought, it takes not less than two years for the community to even partially recover."" Francesca Sangiori, Humanitarian Director at Save the Children Somalia, added: ""Although we have seen recent rain in Somalia, the crisis is far from over. In fact, the rains led to flooding earlier this year.

""People were killed, hundreds of thousands were made homeless and many more children were left vulnerable to malnutrition and disease outbreaks like cholera. It will take years for families to rebuild their lives. Whether they're fighting for survival now or being forced to miss school in order to work, many children in Somalia are suffering at pivotal moments in their lives.

""Our teams can only be there at those moments if humanitarian funding is sustained. And it's vital the international community, including the UK, work together to tackle the root causes of the climate crisis and child hunger and malnutrition."" Back at Banadir Hospital, Samiro continues to pray for her daughter Nasro's recovery. And soon, God willing, she may see her child smile once more.

Family names have been changed.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has been described as the current biggest threat to public health and has already killed people in Iraq, Pakistan and Namibia

An unpleasant rash - which can affect three different parts of the body - is a common symptom of the fatal virus Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF).

The bug is sweeping through Europe, having already killed people in Iraq, Pakistan and Namibia, and last week experts said it is ""highly likely"" there could soon be cases in the UK.

The Mirror highlighted nine symptoms on Monday, which include neck pain and stiffness, and fever. However, a painful rash is a further sign, and it can develop on skin, in the mouth, and in the throat. It is caused by bleeding in these areas, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.

WHO's website states: ""Clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin. The petechiae may give way to larger rashes called ecchymoses, and other haemorrhagic phenomena.""

Petechiae are red dots on the skin, caused by broken blood vessels under the skin.

Last week, James Wood, head of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University, said CCHF could find its way to the UK ""through our ticks, at some point"". Climate change is aiding the spread of the virus as creatures move to new territories, and away from the likes of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia.

In documented outbreaks of CCHF, fatality rates in hospitalised patients ranged from nine percent to as high as 50 percent. The long-term effects of CCHF infection have not been studied well enough in survivors to determine whether or not specific complications exist. However, recovery is slow.

Nine other symptoms of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever

Myalgia (muscle ache)

Dizziness

Neck pain and stiffness

Backache

Headache

Sore eyes

Photophobia (sensitivity to light)

Nausea

Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites.

WHO's website adds: ""It is difficult to prevent or control CCHF infection in animals and ticks as the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in domestic animals is usually not apparent.

""Furthermore, the tick vectors are numerous and widespread, so tick control with acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) is only a realistic option for well-managed livestock production facilities.""

From queues in Dover to rising food prices, Brexit has been blamed for a number of things impacting families. But it has given us Rishi Sunak's 'Brexit pub guarantee' - here we look at the good, the bad and the ugly consequences

It may be seven years since UK voters opted to leave the EU, but new consequences - with a lot more to come.

The Government is working out how to deliver its 'bonfire of EU rules' after angering Tory backbenchers with a screeching U-turn on the timescale. But changes to travel rules - which will see Brits travelling to Europe required to undergo biometric tests - are another headache on the horizon. Bosses in Dover have already warned the move could mean border checks take up to four times as long.

It's also been linked with labour shortages in some sectors, while academics have concluded that leaving the European Union led to average food bills rising by £210. But unsurprisingly this is hotly contested, and the Government has repeatedly said Britain is reaping the benefits of Brexit.

Plenty of economists have picked through the drop in trade with the EU and the impact that's had. In June The Mirror reported just one in five Leave voters thought Brexit had gone well, with two thirds saying politicians had failed to get a good deal.

Here we look at some of the good, bad and ugly impacts it's had on our day-to-day lives.

Delays at borders

One of the most obvious impacts - particularly at this time of year - can be seen at the UK's borders. Peak holiday times have seen long queues at Dover as Brits head over to mainland Europe. This week was no different, with gridlock causing misery for drivers.

The Government has maintained that a ""combination of factors"" is to blame, and said it's wrong to point the finger entirely at Brexit. But Keir Starmer hit back, saying in April it was ""obvious"" there would be problems with more border checks in place.

Meanwhile the Port of Dover's chief executive, Doug Bannister, has also admitted Brexit had led to longer processing times at the border. He told the Observer that he did expect this to improve with time, however, stating: ""People will get slicker at reading passports, get slicker at lodging paperwork and checking paperwork. But we are in a different trading regime.""

But there's another issue on the horizon, with new biometric checks expected to be brought in next year - more on that below.

Meanwhile at airports and international railway stations, British citizens can no longer use the border control lanes for EU citizens. They usually have to have their passport stamped when entering and leaving the EU.

EU biometric checks

Holidaymakers travelling through the Channel Tunnel could be forced to wait FOUR TIMES longer than they are now thanks to new EU border checks, officials warn. Next year the EU is expected to bring in its new Entry/Exit System (EES) system.

This is a requirement for all people entering the union from outside of Europe, but borders chiefs are frank about the fact they expect there to be teething problems. It's now expected to be introduced after the Olympic Games in Paris next summer.

People entering the EU will be required to have their fingerprints scanned and a photograph taken to register them on a database the first time they enter a member state. John Keefe, chief corporate and public affairs officer at Getlink, which operates the Channel Tunnel, told MPs last month: ""The time required to capture all of this data on top of the passport control at the border could add anything between a multiple of two to four times the time required to go through the border today.

""This unresolved could result in significant queues for passengers in cars in particular trying to get through the enrollment process.""

Brexit 'drove food bills up by average of £250'

As mentioned above, the impact of Brexit is the subject of intense debate. But one effect which experts believe it's had is a rise in food prices.

Earlier this year a study by the London School of Economics ruled that food bills had gone up by 6%, adding an extra £250 to household bills, researchers found. Over two years, the study concluded, UK households spent an extra £7billion which they wouldn't have done if the UK hadn't left the EU.

Researchers said that the price of food imported from the EU - including things like tomatoes and potatoes - shot up by around 6%. But on the other hand it could have given a boost to UK producers.

Since 2019 the cost of food has gone up by around 25% - but this would be 17% if post-Brexit trade restrictions weren't in place, LSE concluded. It highlighted trade barriers such as additional paperwork and increased testing on livestock.

...And incoming controls 'could make it even worse'

New post-Brexit controls set to come into effect in January could drive up food prices and the risk of disruption even further, industry chiefs warn.

New checks on food imports, which haven't been fully implemented, will see additional charges of between £20 and £43 on goods. Nichola Mallon, head of trade at Logistics UK, said this is ""very concerning"", adding: ""It is too high and, if introduced, will add to inflationary pressures and is likely to lead to market distortion in the movement of goods.""

LSE report author Nikhil Datta wrote: ""Not everything has been instituted at the border. For instance, not all veterinary checks are being carried out.

""It could be that there will be no adjustment in prices when they do take effect because businesses have already accounted for the extra costs. Or the extra barriers, when they come into effect, do increase prices and householders will face a further increase in their food costs.""

But there's always the 'Brexit pub guarantee'

Rishi Sunak was very enthusiastic this week as he outlined sweeping changes to alcohol duties. Leaving the EU has given the UK increased powers to overhaul the way alcohol is taxed, and the PM claimed his measures make it easier to protect pubs.

Under the new 'Brexit pub guarantee', the rate of duty on draught beer and cider has been reduced by 9.2% - while the standard rate on packaged beer and alcoholic drinks has gone up by 10.1%

However if he thought pub bosses would be jumping for joy, he was sadly mistaken. Firstly he was heckled by a landlord as he pulled a pint on Tuesday, and then Wetherspoons boss - and Brexit cheerleader - Tim Martin warned it would cost his business an extra £8million a year.

He told The Independent: ""The compounding factor is that pubs pay 20 per cent vat in respect of food sales, whereas supermarkets pay nothing,"" he said. Pubs also pay about 25 pence per pint in business rates, whereas supermarkets pay a fraction of this amount - perhaps two pence a pint or so. Supermarkets use this tax advantage to subsidise beer and wine prices. The combo of tax inequality and tax increases is bad news.""

Working or living abroad

As you'd expect with the end of free movement, Brits now have to secure appropriate visas in order to work, study or live in the EU. Although people can still buy homes in European countries, they cannot stay for more than 90 days of every 180 without permission.

British citizens still do not need to apply for a visa in advance of travel to the EU as a short-term visitor. The rules for short-term visits to most EU Member States are set out in the Schengen Borders Code. However their eligibility to live, work or study in an EU Member State depends on the host country's national immigration laws and visa requirements.

Labour shortages and impact of wages

There's been lots of talk about the impact of EU workers leaving the UK, and the supply of labour from Europe drying up. Transport and warehousing was heaviest hit, and in 2021 the shortage of HGV drivers became a real problem.

It did present some opportunities as well as challenges, with companies no longer as able to rely on workers from abroad, raising hopes that it could see packets rise for UK workers. This certainly seems to have happened for lorry drivers and hospitality staff. This has, however, also meant higher bills for customers.

In spite of pressure from the Tory right to bring down net migration, which was at a record high last year, Rishi Sunak was forced to add jobs to the shortage occupation list. This is a list of professions where shortages mean the need for workers is so intense that visa requirements can be relaxed. Builders and construction workers were added last month, while some occupations such as social care workers have long been in place.

Across the labour market there was a shortfall of 460,000 EU workers between January 2021 and June last year, including 103,000 in wholesale and retail, 67,000 in hospitality and food. Knock-on effects of this included businesses such as restaurants reducing their hours because they couldn't find staff.

'Bonfire' questions over workers' protections

The Government was forced into a humiliating U-turn when it announced it would no longer be striking over 4,000 EU laws by the end of the year. Under plans put forward in the Retained EU Law Bill, a 'bonfire' would have seen a massive legislation overhaul.

This might sound pretty abstract, but in order to do this ministers would have to make some serious decisions that could affect us all. As Unison pointed out, many core workplace protections - including holiday pay, maternity pay and equal pay for women and men - come from the European Union. Striking these from the statute books could have some pretty grim consequences unless similar protections were adopted in UK law.

With all these questions remaining, the Government slammed on the brakes, with Kemi Badenoch instead announcing around 600 pieces of EU law will be reviewed this year.

Roaming charges

Since the UK left the European Union, residents are no longer covered by a 2017 bloc-wide law that made roaming, text, and calls free in all Member States. Many people have been caught out by the new rules, returning from their holidays to face a huge bill.

One man recently revealed he wracked up a £200,000 bill during a four-day holiday in Turkey. Phone companies are now allowed to set their own rules, with vastly different approaches.

Cost of ordering goods and receiving gifts from the EU

Leaving the EU has had an impact on ordering goods from Europe - and as you'd expect, they can be pretty complex. Under the new rules import VAT and excise duties apply for all alcohol, tobacco and perfume products ordered from the EU.

For everything else new charges kick in if goods are worth more than £135. If this the case, customers have to pay import VAT and possibly customs duties - with costs varying according to factors including shipping costs.

Another pitfall HMRC has warned shoppers about is making sure sellers do not charge them VAT - as they could be charged twice.

There are also new costs attached to receiving gifts from the EU. If a gift is valued at over £39, the recipient must pay VAT, and if it's over £135 customs duty comes into play well. And there could be a 'handling fee' to pay as well.

For space-tight Brits, miniature breeds have been winning our hearts and they are rapidly starting to catch up on dogs'm status as 'man's best friend'

Dogs have hogged the ""man's best friend"" title for centuries, but a growing number of people now think that is just hogwash, insisting that miniature pigs make better pets. A study has found that little porkers are just as likely to shower humans with affection and - as the big bad wolf from the fairy tale knows - they are far more intelligent than dogs to boot.

One owner whose pig is definitely her best friend is Joanne Lefson, 50, who this week revealed that her sow Pigcasso is bringing home the bacon, having made £1million with her ""pork-traits"". The painting pig's clients include tennis ace Rafael Nadal, making her snout to sniff at, especially as she was rescued en route to the abattoir.

While globe-trotter Pigcasso now lives in South Africa and weighs 1,000lbs, for space-tight Brits, miniature breeds have been winning our hearts. Little piggies Smokey and Bandit live a life of luxury in Rainbow Lagdale Smith and John Beresford's Cheshire home, liking nothing better than cuddling up with them on the sofa.

John, a police officer who jokes he is a ""pig with a pig"", says: ""They have free range on the bottom floor of the house. They're in the lounge. The fires are on and the pigs will sleep in front of the fire. There are patio doors, so they'll get up or eat outdoors or use the toilet outside. Smokey's never tried to go upstairs, but Bandit enjoys going upstairs - but can't get down again.""

Rainbow and John have a pig walking licence from the Animal and Plant Health Agency, which allows them to walk them on a pre-approved route as it is still classed as transporting livestock. Rainbow says: ""We could never get Smokey into a harness. She just wasn't interested, but we're training Bandit so that we can take him on walks.""

The two pets have very different personalities. Bandit, a castrated male, is still very young compared to older female Smokey. Rainbow says: ""He's way more cuddly and soppy."" Victoria Wiseman, an actress from Colchester, Essex, has loved pigs since she was a child, and her decision to get Peanut and Noodle was five years in the making. She says: ""I did a lot of research.""

Before buying Peanut and Noodle, she built an enclosure with a water feature. She says: ""The main thing that I do with mine is teach them agility and tricks, so I've got a big course outside. They've got an agility bridge and they've got an agility seesaw. They've got jumps and hoop jumps as well.""

Victoria trains them every day if she can, for 20 minutes to half an hour. She says: ""Peanut will do almost anything when it comes to daredevil stuff. I've got crash mats next to the agility bridge. He went on it and jumped off the thing, just for fun. I knew it was for fun as he went on and did it again.""

Noodle is scared of heights, but has other talents. She says: ""He has a big amount of focus, but is calmer. I have started doing heel-to music with him like they do with dogs, so he will weave between my legs.""

David Sansom has two, 10-month-old micro pigs called Polly and Poppy. With a background in agriculture David, 63, from Ibstock, Leics, used to have a commercial pig herd, which inspired him to get his adorable pets. He says: ""I always loved having pigs. I got soft as I aged so couldn't ever send them to slaughter. That's why I got back into them with micro pigs.""

The two little porkers live in a big enclosure with David's two miniature Shetland ponies. He says: ""I've got a Labrador as well and the whole lot all get on brilliantly They all seem to respect each other."" Like his dog, David's pigs love being petted. He says: ""They are very similar in wanting attention. Of course, with a dog you should be going out and walking each day. For the lazy pet owner, a micro pig is probably ideal.""

David hangs out with his pigs as often as he can. ""I spend ages chatting with them, the locals must think I am mad. When I'm up there, sitting with the micro pigs, and just chatting, and rubbing them, it's very relaxing. It's quite therapeutic, really.""

Katie Mason fell in love with micro-pigs while working with them at a farm in Devon and it wasn't long before she had two of her own, Rupert and Penny. Rupert was once snouted, sorry, scouted, by a producer to audition on Britain's Got Talent. Katie, 41, who helped breed pigs at Pennywell Farm, Buckfastleigh, Devon, before turning to teaching, taught him the names of things using positive reinforcement, and in front of the judges Rupert played a keyboard, filed some paperwork, pulled levers, used a mobile phone, and went through tunnels.

Sadly he was given the chop before the live semi-finals. Rupert's pen pal Penny wasn't as easy to train. Katie says: ""Penny was really naughty. She opened all the cupboards, the fridge, the oven, the lot and took everything out. Rupert wouldn't do a thing wrong. He used to hate me telling Penny off, he took it personally and would go in the corner all upset.""

The pigs could go outside when they wanted, but preferred sitting on the sofa. They also got on well with Katie's Labrador and Border Collie. She says: ""They used to sleep on top of the old Lab when they were smaller. They're very intelligent, very clean, and very easy to train. You don't need to toilet train them as they are naturally toilet-trained.""

Sadly they've both gone to the big stye in the sky, but Katie would highly recommend pigs as pets. She says: ""They will probably be the most intelligent pet you could have. Studies have shown they understand consequences and they understand their own reflection, the only other animals that understand mirrors are dolphins, chimps... and humans.""

WARNING - UPSETTING IMAGE: The Cleveland Bay breed was saved from extinction by the late Queen and now one has been found lying dead in a field in Wales after someone fed the animal through the fence

One of the world's rarest horses from a breed loved by the late Queen has died after being given food by a well-meaning passerby.

The prized Cleveland Bay broodmare was found lying dead in a field and evidence at the scene appears to show she was fed over the gate by a stranger oblivious to the terrible consequences. Adding to the tragedy was the loss of an unborn foal being carried by the mare. Having previously lost another horse in similar circumstances, Gwynedd breeder William Medforth has now begged the public to be more aware of the perils of roadside feeding.

Since his father Charles's death in 2017, William has assumed his role as a guardian of the Cleveland Bay, one of Britain's oldest equine breeds. A renowned horse lover, Queen Elizabeth II played a key role in saving the breed which came close to dying out in the 1960s, with just four remaining. One of the stallions was spotted by the Queen, who purchased it and took it to Windsor. The horse was used for breeding and it was from him that they began to populate again. Cleveland Bays are still closely tied to the Royal Family and are one of just two breeds housed at the Royal Mews.

""This is a breed rarer than the giant panda,"" said William. ""So to lose one of our most prolific brood mares and her unborn foal is not just devastating for our breeding programme, it's damaging for the breed as a whole."" Nant Loyw Harmony, bought by Charles Medforth shortly before his death, was playing a crucial breeding role at the Penrhyn Stud in Llanrug, Caernarfon. The 16-year-old mare had already produced two foals for the stud and was due to foal again next May. Her value lay in the purity of her ""old breeding"" bloodlines in what is England's oldest breed of horse.

Last Sunday evening, Will checked up on her and all was well. He told the Daily Post Wales: ""At 8am the next morning I drove past the field on my way to work and saw her lying in the field. Evidence suggested someone had tossed food items over the gate and she had died of colic or perhaps choke. Patches of grass nearby had been extensively grazed, a sign she had been scouring food items from the ground. There also appeared to be remnants of peelings at the edges of these patches. Harmony loved her food, so it's likely she ate the majority of what she was given.""

Her death-by-feeding was the farm's second in three years. In 2020, an 18-month-old gelding collapsed in a different field and food items were discovered within 6ft of his body. Following that incident, notices were erected on all the farm's roadside boundaries imploring people not to feed its horses.

In the wake of Harmony's death, William took to social media to raise awareness of the dangers of roadside feeding. He told North Wales Live: ""Over winter, there's less grass on the ground and fields can be a little muddy, so some people might think horses and livestock aren't getting enough food. Others might just think it's a nice idea to feed a pretty horse. But our horses are well looked after, they're fed a balanced diet and they want for nothing. If anything, they're fed better than we are.

""Why do the general public think it's OK to feed livestock without permission? They wouldn't walk up to someone and feed their dog chocolate or grapes, which are poisonous to them. People might think carrots are OK for horses but, cut the wrong way, they can cause choke. So please don't interfere with their diets, you might be killing them with your ignorance.""

Clevelands remain highly regarded as hunters and jumpers, having featured as part-breds at several Olympics. Yet the breed is still regarded as critically endangered by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, with less than 300 breeding females registered worldwide. In contrast, around 1,860 giant pandas remain in the wild.

Due to the fires in Greece, several airlines, including easyJet and package operator Tui, sent planes to Rhodes to evacuate tourists forced out of hotels

An easyJet pilot urged a plane of passengers not to travel to Rhodes in a terrifying warning before taking off.

A week-old wildfire on the Greek resort island of Rhodes tore past defences on Monday, forcing more evacuations as strong winds and successive heat waves that left scrubland and forests tinder-dry fuelled three major fires raging elsewhere in Greece.

The latest evacuations were ordered in south Rhodes after 19,000 people, mostly tourists were moved in buses and boats over the weekend out of the path of the fire that reached several coastal areas from nearby mountains. It was the country's biggest evacuation effort in recent years.

This comes as an easyJet pilot issued a stern warning to Brits still flying out to the wildfire-ravaged island of Rhodes on Monday.

Thousands of exhausted holidaymakers are arriving back in the UK and have slammed the ""chaotic"" evacuation.

A total of 37 passengers, including a young boy, attempted to fly out of Gatwick to Rhodes on Monday despite terrifying fires scorching the Greek island, sparking the country's biggest evacuation in history.

But in the final moments before take-off, the pilot issued a warning, urging the passengers on board the 180-seat capacity aircraft not to travel to the resort island.

European heatwave

Why is it so hot in Europe at the moment?

Heatwaves are defined as uncharacteristically hot periods which last for three days or more. The Cerberus heatwave - named after a three-headed dog that guards the entrance to hell in Dante Allighieri's Inferno - brought temperatures approaching 40C.

The Charon heatwave - named after Greek mythology's ferryman for the dead - comes as almost half of Europe is placed under an amber drought warning. Charon won't reach the UK though, as the inferno is set to slowly shift southeast over the coming week.

What is causing the heatwave?

Cerberus is being driven by the combination of a high-pressure system sitting above the Mediterranean and unseasonably high sea surface temperatures. This means that, as air descends, light winds are created, whilst rising evaporation creates humidity. The hottest summers are now 30 times more likely to occur than before the Industrial Revolution, according to the Met Office, due to climate change.

The Charon anticyclone is thought to have been created by a southern shift of the jet stream - a ribbon of winds high up in the atmosphere that drives weather systems. This develops a high-pressure region across southern Europe and northern Africa, which may last for weeks.

What are the dangers of heatwaves?

Heatwaves are becoming more regular and intense in Europe, due to the climate crisis. Last summer's heat waves contributed to an estimated 61,000 deaths in Europe, compared to the 72,000 deaths recorded across the continent during the devastating 2003 European heat wave. Young children, those with serious health conditions, and the elderly are at a higher risk of heat-related illness.

If you are travelling to Europe, follow Foreign Office advice and speak to your travel operator before travelling, as you may not be offered a refund. As an extreme heat event seems set to hit the UK over the next few weeks, it is vital to stay hydrated and avoid caffeine and alcohol. It is also important to know the symptoms of heatstroke, which include: nausea, weakness, cramps, heat rash and tiredness.

Extreme temperatures can also trigger natural disasters such as the wildfires engulfing the Greek island of Rhodes, which has seen 19,000 people evacuated.

Reporting by Eleanor Luxton

Gwyn Loader, who was on the flight to Rhodes to report for BBC Wales' Welsh-language news programme Newyddion, said that eight passengers chose to listen to the advice and disembark, including the young boy who was in tears.

The pilot told passengers over the Tannoy before take-off: ""Travelling to Rhodes for a holiday at the moment is a terrible idea.""

They added: ""As far as I'm concerned, this flight is being operated on an emergency basis. Return flights are now being managed by the military. If you want to get off flight, you are welcome to do so.

""I don't know in what capacity you are travelling, but if you are travelling for leisure, my sincere recommendation is it's a bad idea.""

Temperatures reached the low 40Cs (above 104F) in parts of the Greek mainland Monday, a day after soaring as high as 45 degrees (113F).

Evacuations were also ordered overnight on the western island of Corfu, where more than 2,000 people were moved to safety by land and sea, as well as on the island of Evia and in a mountainous area in the southern Peloponnese region.

In Greece, an average of 50 new wildfires have broken out daily for the past 12 days, according to government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis. On Sunday, 64 new blazes were recorded.

The Rhodes fire roared down mountain slopes, burning homes and cars and leaving livestock dead on the roadside as they tried to escape.

Authorities said no serious injuries were reported, but hospitals and health volunteers provided first aid to tourists and others, mostly for the effects of heat and dehydration.

A yellow weather warning for rain is in place in Northern Ireland until 9pm. A similar warning for wind is in place today for Wales and South West England.

The UK is set to be battered by fierce winds of up to 50mph and showers as the Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for wind and rain.

Four yellow weather warnings are in place today, covering the south west of England and west of Wales for dangerous winds and rain warnings for Northern Ireland and parts of northern Scotland.

Then tomorrow, all of the south of England and Wales, stretching into the Midlands has a yellow wind warning, and Scotland's rain warnings remain in place.

It comes as Europe is sweating through a record heatwave that has seen temperatures reach 48C, meanwhile, the UK is set to have miserable weather.

The wet and windy weather today and into the weekend, is being caused by two rather menacing looking low pressure systems rushing in across the UK on Friday and lingering over the weekend.

The Met Office has warned that this could bring winds of up to 50mph and heavy downpours too - particularly for today and tomorrow.

Met Office Chief Meteorologist, Paul Gundersen, said: ""Strong winds will develop across the South West early on Friday, pushing further north across parts of Wales through the day. Gusts of 35 to 45 mph are likely quite widely for a time, with gusts over 50 mph affecting some coasts and hills, mainly across Cornwall and west Wales.

""This is an unusual time of year for such strong winds and, with many people on holiday or planning outdoor activities, they are likely to cause some disruption.

""In addition, heavy rain could lead to standing water and spray on roads and consequently difficult driving conditions. Winds are expected to ease through the evening.

""Temperatures are expected to stay near average or rather cool over the coming days especially in the rain and wind.""

The miserable weather conditions hitting the UK are part of a prolonged set of unsettled weather that isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

Nicola Maxey, a spokesperson for Met Office told the Mirror that we could see showers and cloudy skies until the end of the month, or even stretching into early August.

She said: ""In the UK we're looking at fairly unsettled conditions and cooler temperatures, to continue until the end of the month, due to the southerly position of the Jet Stream.

""I don't know if this weather is unusual for this time of the year, unsettled weather in the UK summer isn't particularly unusual.

""As for where the temperatures are likely to go when the unsettled weather ends, towards the end of the month it'll continue but towards the end of the month and into mid-august we're expecting temperatures closer to normal.""

This all comes as millions of people across Europe are set to roast in conditions as hot as 48C.

This is explained by the Jet Stream, the core of wind responsible for influencing much of the UK's weather, which has shifted southwards recently.

This has pushed high-pressure systems southwards into Europe and Africa and also led to low-pressure systems being directed into the UK.

Nicola Maxey, a spokesperson for the Met Office, told the Mirror that this was: ""bringing more unsettled and cooler weather here than we experienced in June when the Jet stream was at a more northerly latitude.""

With it, the UK will be battered by gusts of up to 50mph and heavy downpours.

So whilst Europe will be battling stifling heat, it might be worth bringing an umbrella and raincoat out if you're due to head out today and tomorrow.

The searing conditions will heighten the risk of heat-related illness and even death with livelihoods also at risk as entire fields of crops and livestock are set to be decimated as Europe turns into an oven.

Europe is already suffering under a heatwave called Cerberus - named after the three-headed hound who guarded the underworld in Greek mythology.

Cerberus is an anticyclone that originated over the Saharan desert but has pushed north in recent days from Italy, now affecting Croatia and causing life-threatening wildfires.

Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey have all been put under the grill in recent days with the heatwave expected to turn up its intensity before the end of next week.

But Cerberus is just the start of the apocalyptic round of heat pounding the continent.

Looming in the wings is Charon - a heatwave with a similarly infernal moniker that is named after the ferryman who carried condemned souls into the underworld.

This second heatwave may bring even hotter temperatures to the continent.

Marian Clode screamed and was thrown in the air like a ragdoll when the animal charged her and flipped her over a fence where she lay dying, before succumbing to her injuries two days later in hospital

A farm company must pay more than £100,000 after a teacher was killed by a stampeding cow which had broken free from its holding pen on the farm she was staying at with her family.

Marian Clode screamed and was thrown in the air like a ragdoll when the animal charged her, she was flipped over a fence where she lay dying, succumbing to her injuries two days later in hospital. The attack came as she walked along a path during a family holiday in Northumberland in 2016 with her young grandchildren, an inquest into her death heard.

Today, JM Nixon partnership, which runs the farm was fined £72,500 and was ordered to also pay £34,700 costs, plus a victim surcharge of several hundred pounds. Tom Gent, for the farm business, said assets would have to be sold to make the payment and the judge granted the firm 12 months to pay.

The 61-year-old primary school teacher, from Greater Manchester, had been staying at a holiday cottage at Swinhoe Farm, near Belford with her family. On April 3, 2016 they walked to St Cuthbert's Cave - a route they had done ""many times"", Newcastle Coroners' Court previously heard. The 61-year-old had been walking along a public bridleway with her husband, Christopher, daughter Lucy, son-in-law Kevin and two grandchildren, aged seven and eight when about 15 cows and their calves surged from a holding pen.

During the inquest into Mrs Clode's death Coroner Karen Dilks told the jury that on that day, Swinhoe Farm owner Alistair Nixon was moving cattle from their winter sheds into open fields, for the first time in months. As Mr Nixon prepared to make the move, some of the cows broke loose from the holding pen and ran past him onto the public bridleway.

At the time Mrs Clode and her family were about to arrive back at the farm from their walk when ""around 15"" cows appeared over the brow of a hill. Ms Dilks said the topography of the area meant neither the group of walkers nor Mr Nixon could see over the hill at the time. Reliving the incident, Mrs Clode's daughter Lucy said: ""My mum was leading the walk at that point. We were about two minutes away and I think she just wanted to get back and get settled.""

As the animals appeared over the hill, Lucy said: ""It was about 15 cows stampeding towards my mum, that's when I realised we were in trouble. There were hedges on either side and barbed wire. As the cattle came over the brow of the hill I could see Kevin literally throw the children over the barbed wire and I could see my mum, who was in the most danger, stand to the right hand side and tuck herself under the gate by the tree. She had no time to do anything.

""I got over the fence, I cut my knees on the barbed wire. They were running very very fast and we were trying to get out of danger. The lane dropped which naturally slowed [the cows] and they didn't know what to do. The lead cow, this big black cow, slowed down, so they all slowed down. It must have caught sight of my mum.

""It turned, backed up, hit her, backed up again, hit her again, backed up again and hit her, and flipped her over the fence like a ragdoll. Before the first charge my mum knew it had seen her and was going to attack her - she screamed. That was the last thing she ever said.""

Lucy said: ""It was a nightmare because the cows were all there, and separating me and Kevin from mum was this thicket hedge. Instinct took over, I pushed myself through the thicket hedge and managed to get to mum. Kevin was phoning the ambulance and my mum was dying, basically.""

The inquest heard Ms Clode was airlifted to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, where she died on April 5, 2016.

Lucy told the hearing the family had booked a holiday at Swinhoe Farm, which has a riding school and holiday cottages, for a third time after enjoying previous trips. She said: ""We particularly liked it because we booked the kids in to do horse riding. The farm advertises that it's plentiful for walks with direct access to St Cuthbert's Cave. We were on a road, my mum was exactly where she should have been, we were not in a field. She did what she could and what a lot of people would advise.""

A statement from Mrs Clode's family said the mother-of-three was a ""hardworking and dedicated teacher"" who ""lived for her family"" and ""adored and doted on her four grandchildren"". They said: ""It's heart-breaking she never got to see them grow up, or meet her fifth grandchild. The events of April 3, 2016 cut her life short in the cruellest possible way. Her life was over in an instant, and the lives of her family were changed forever.""

On Wednesday, Alistair Nixon, on behalf of the JM Nixon partnership, which runs the farm, admitted a health and safety breach during a hearing at Newcastle Crown Court. He admitted that the business failed to ensure the health and safety of persons other than employees by exposing them to risks to their safety from the movement of cattle.

Today, Judge Tim Gittin described what went wrong as a ""salutary lesson"" for herdsmen of the necessity to plan and then review that plan when moving livestock ""however usually docile"" they may be.

The farm had been in the Nixon family since 1939, the judge said, and there had been no previous safety concerns. The business has now changed its cattle movement practices and there have been no incidents since Mrs Clode's death, the court heard.

Afghanistan is facing its coldest winter in 15 years, with temperatures dropping as low as -34 degrees Celsius, as the death doubles in less than a week

Around 157 people have tragically died in freezing temperatures in Afghanistan in the past fortnight, Taliban officials say, with the toll doubling in less than a week.

The country is facing its coldest winter in 15 years, with temperatures dropping as low as -34 degrees Celsius.

The ability to firefight the situation has been seriously hampered by the limited amount of aid being distributed, following the Taliban's ban on female NGO workers.

Acting Minister of Disaster Management Mullah Mohammad Abbas Akhund told the BBC that many areas of Afghanistan were now completely cut off by snow.

Military helicopters had been sent to the rescue, but they couldn't land in the most mountainous regions.

He said: ""We're concerned about those who are still living in the mountain regions. Most of the roads which pass through the mountains have been closed due to snow. Cars have got stuck there and passengers have died in the freezing temperatures.""

The acting minister said he was very concerned about people's lives and their livestock which is their lifeline.

""Most of the people who lost their lives to the cold were shepherds or people living in rural areas. They didn't have access to healthcare,"" Mullah Akhund said.

Last month, NGOs working in Afghanistan halted their operations in protest of the new Taliban order banning women from working with humanitarian groups.

The 80-90,000 women working in the aid sector had to stop working overnight.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said on Twitter it was delivering aid such as blankets, heating and shelter to some 565,700 people.

""But much more is needed amid one of the coldest spells in years,"" it added.

The lack of a consistent electricity supply in the country forces families to choose between food and heat.

Left without power and freezing in their homes, Afghans often turn to burning wood, coal, and even plastic to heat their homes - leading air pollution to increase by up to 50 per cent during the winter months in Kabul, according to the New Humanitarian which says the extra smog also drives up respiratory ailments.

""This winter is by far the coldest in recent years,"" said Mohammad Nasim Muradi, the head of Afghanistan's meteorology office.

He said to Al Jazeera they expect the cold wave to continue for another week or more.

In a second snap, her ex husband Clive, 68, had swapped places with her and took his turn for a photo with their brood.

Alongside gifs of a digger and a sheep, Amanda wrote: ""The farm army. Many hands make light work.""

She posted the family photos on Mother's Day - her first one since splitting from Clive in July last year.

The couple were married for 22 years and went on to have nine children and star in the successful Channel 5 show together.

They went through a rocky patch in 2021 while Amanda, also know as the Yorkshire Shepardess, was promoting her book, but reconciled.

They ended their relationship for good last summer, with Amanda announcing the news on Instagram, writing: ""Although we are no longer a couple, we continue to work on the farm and co-parent together, with our number one priority the happiness and well-being of our children.""

Their split was followed by the cancellation of Our Yorkshire Farm, which chronicled their life at Ravenseat Farm.

After their separation, Amanda started to film a new More4 documentary, called Amanda Owen's Farming Lives which is her first series on her own without Clive.

The ex-couple are now supporting their brood, who range in age from 21 to five, and Amanda, 48, has been opened about the reality of co-parenting, after she moved to a separate farmhouse on their land, with some of the kids.

The mum has also previously insisted there is ""no problem"" between herself and Clive and shut down any suggestion a third party was involved in the split.

Reruns of Our Yorkshire Farm are shown on Channel 5. Amanda Owen's Farming Lives is available on More4.

Jeremy Clarkson told Clarkson's Farm viewers how he shared details to his co-star Kaleb Cooper of his latest grand scheme to become a pig farmer

Jeremy Clarkson has told how his Clarkson's Farm co-star Kaleb Cooper abandoned Diddly Squat for a week after hearing the Grand Tour host's ""˜stupidest idea yet'.

The 62-year-old TV presenter shared details of his latest scheme to become a pig farmer, prompting dissent from his 24-year-old farmhand.

Former Top Gear presenter Jeremy's latest project comes after the farm's Diddly Squat shop shut its doors for a month following the backlash for comments Clarkson made about Meghan Markle.

The Top Gear presenter, 62, wrote a column detailing his hatred of the Duchess of Sussex where he said he dreamed about her being 'paraded naked through the streets' while people 'throw lumps of excrement at her'.

Now Clarkson has taken to his column and explained that he has become a pig farmer, writing: ""Cheerful Charlie Ireland, my land agent, says this is the stupidest idea I've had yet and wants no part of it.""

He went on to note that an exasperated Kaleb had also decided to leave Chipping Norton after hearing the news.

""Kaleb was so unpleased that he got into his pick-up truck and went to Cornwall for a week,"" Jeremy continued.

Jeremy explained why he felt his ""˜logic was sound' as he laid out his plan for the pigs in his latest article for The Times, suggesting that pigs are ""˜much cheaper' than other livestock.

He also argued that the large broods the pigs would produce would be more financially beneficial.

Describing how pigs ""˜hosed out' piglets like ""˜machine gun bullets', he wrote: ""You buy ten pigs for a few quid and three months later you have ten million. That's profit, right there. Pure, naked profit.""

Jeremy added that he would also be saving money by feeding his un-harvestable potatoes to the pigs rather than letting them rot.

However, he confessed that, as well as Kaleb, his land agent wasn't impressed even after he explained his plans in full.

""Charlie responded to this argument by rolling his eyes and going home,"" he wrote, ""Which meant that Lisa and I had to spend a week or two learning an all-new language: pig.""

Prime Video has revealed that Clarkson's Farm will return to the streaming platform in February, when the Diddly Squat shop will also reopen.

The usually outspoken Clarkson has remained noticeably silent on his social media since admitting he had 'rather put his foot in it' with his Meghan Markle comments.

Breaking his silence on the backlash, Jeremy told his 7 million followers: ""Oh dear. I've rather put my foot in it. In a column I wrote about Meghan, I made a clumsy reference to a scene in Game of Thrones and this has gone down badly with a great many people.

""I'm horrified to have caused so much hurt and I shall be more careful in future.""

Hot on the heels of update 1.1.1, which was well received by Diablo 4 players, update 1.1.2 offers some further slight tweaks

The latest Diablo 4 patch notes address a long-gestating issue that has annoyed fans for months but also nerfs a wildly popular way to farm Nightmare Dungeons.

Just as much as Activision Blizzard giveth, so does it take away. The recent haphazardness seen with the many Diablo 4 hotfix rollouts only serves to prove this, with the latest one addressing the Malignant Heart grind players were feeling as part of the ongoing Season of the Malignant. The much-anticipated update 1.1.1 finally scaled back much of the Barbarian and Sorcerer class buffs introduced by the prior update 1.1.0a that caused community outrage, true, but now more fixes are on the way as outlined in the Diablo 4 update 1.1.2 patch notes.

As outlined in Blizzard's blog post, the headline takeaway from the Diablo 4 update 1.1.2 patch notes is that the Fury Against Fate bug, in which players weren't able to complete the lengthy questline and were forced to find workarounds, has finally been addressed. On the less positive side of things, however, the patch notes mention that ""an issue where Nightmare Dungeons could be repeated by promoting other party members to leader"" has been fixed, meaning no more fun for players who enjoyed exploiting this popular farming glitch.

Outside of the usual round of bug fixes we've come to expect from Diablo 4 patch notes, several tweaks have been provided to the Druid class which currently suffered from doing less than full damage with an Active Skill if a particular Aspect was equipped. In terms of Diablo 4 Season 1 itself, players running Malignant Tunnels also won't have to wait as long for a Malignant Monster to spawn, as it's been reduced from five seconds to two seconds - a small change, but a big difference for hardcore players.

It's worth mentioning that while the Diablo 4 update 1.1.2 patch notes have now been published, they won't actually take effect until Tuesday, August 15. This is in line with the new standard Activision Blizzard has put in place, whereby the patch notes are published a few days before the update is applied in the game. The full list of patch notes for Diablo 4 update 1.1.2 is below:

Bug Fixes

User Interface and User Experience

Miscellaneous

The patch notes for update 1.1.2 aren't as lengthy as prior ones, which is hopefully an indication that Diablo 4 is better balanced than it has been for a while. The community will swiftly make us aware otherwise, if not.

The early-morning twitter appeal came months after Jeremy Clarkson, 62, announced the tiny piglet he introduced just days before has died at his Diddly Squat Farm

Jeremy Clarkson launched an early morning appeal as he pleaded for some help with one of his newborn pigs.

The farmer says one of his animals gave birth very late last night - and then showed 'signs of distress'.

The 62-year-old host of hit show Clarkson's Farm took to twitter at 1.30am this morning in as he revealed how the farm's first piglet had been born hours before.

Jeremy, whose show about his Diddly Squat Farm in Chipping Norton has proved popular on Prime Video, asked: ""Pig farmers. Help. It's been nearly two hours since our first piglet was born. The sow is in some distress. What do we do?""

The platform didn't let him down as people rushed to offer their support.

There was plenty of advice on hand - and also some not-so-helpful tips as one person replied with a picture of a rasher of bacon.

Someone else told Jeremy: ""Likely it's going to involve lubing up an arm and reaching in to pull piglets out."" While @theorigpundit tried to inject a bit of humour by responding: ""Tell her if she doesn't cheer up quickly, she'll be forced to watch a Rishi Sunak speech on a never ending loop.""

Another said: ""Unfortunately, not much you can do. Could be a multitude of things, impossible to know without hands on/detailed description. Unless you can get a vet at 2:30 am on a Saturday. Try to keep her calm and comfortable until a vet is available and prey they make it till morning.""

A third posted: ""I used to have a pastured pork farm with over 100 sows in Australia and assisted in many births. Happy to help if you want.""

It's more struggles for the star who in January announced as announced the tiny piglet he introduced just two days before has died.

Proudly sharing a photo of the tiny creature in his arms in the New Year, Jeremy wrote: ""˜An piglet. Our first.'

But heartache was around the corner.

Alongside a picture of the creature looking poorly, its eyes half-closed while laying on a pile of hay who simply wrote: ""She's died"".

The second series of his Amazon Prime series about life on the farm kicked off last month.

But he has has been slammed by council bosses over his 'misleading' portrayal of a planning permission battle.

Clarkson is filmed storming out of the meeting when they refuse his request to open a new restaurant and farm track on the site.

Fans of the show took to social media to accuse the ""˜pen pushing' councillors of ""˜hating' Clarkson.

But the council have hit back, claiming the scenes were edited and did not accurately represent what really happened.

A spokesperson from West Oxfordshire District Council told Mirror Online: ""The planning meeting shown in Clarkson's Farm ran for well over an hour, but was covered in a matter of minutes in the show.

""That meant a lot of discussion from the meeting was missed, including a lot of very relevant legal planning advice and discussion that informed the decision taken by councillors.""

Although the summer was a bit of a washout with not many barbecues, the downpours and warmer weather experienced in June means shoppers can get expect 'plumpkins' for Halloween

Halloween pumpkins will be frighteningly large thanks to the scarily soggy summer.

Farmers say warm weather in June followed by July and August downpours helped provide a bumper crop. Steve Whitworth, commercial manager at Oakley Farms, near Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, which grows five million pumpkins a year, said: ""We had a pretty good growing season for pumpkins this summer with a really hot June, which helped the plants along.

""The rainy July and August may not have been great for sun lovers or barbecue fans but for pumpkins, it was perfect."" Tesco pumpkin buyer Lucy Moss said: ""The good news for Halloween coming from our main pumpkin growers is the fruit will be larger than normal in all size ­variations this year.

""This year we have six sizes and each category will be larger than usual so shoppers will definitely get value for money. ""We expect the carving variety to continue to be the most popular."" Last year there was a tenfold increase in people searching for pumpkin recipes in September and October, the supermarket said.

Ms Moss added: ""It's great from a food waste point of view.""

Ben Haldon was inspired to take on the challenge and to raise awareness and funds for those battling testicular cancer after having surgery to remove a non-malignant lump

Just a few months after undergoing surgery, a personal trainer has become a Guinness World Records holder.

Ben Haldon became the GWR holder for ""˜the furthest distance in 24 hours farmer's carry 100lb (male)' after he travelled 54km in an effort to help ""carry the weight"" for those battling testicular cancer. A farmer's carry involves participants holding heavy weights whilst walking for a certain amount of time or distance, and the record previously stood at a little over 50km. The 31-year-old decided to take on the challenge after he noticed a lump on his testicle in December 2022, which prompted him to get a check-up after experiencing some discomfort and pain.

During January 2023, Mr Haldon underwent surgery for the non-malignant lump. During his time in hospital, he explained that he started ""toying"" with the GWR idea. The Cheshire based personal trainer told the PA news agency: ""I felt that I wanted to do something for other people because I felt very lucky that my lump was not cancerous. I put my thinking cap on and wanted to do something to carry the weight for other men who are going through testicular cancer and find it hard to speak about, or struggle mentally, and that's where the idea behind carrying 100lb for 24 hours came from.""

Mr Haldon took part in the challenge on Saturday, July 22 at The Oval Leisure Centre in Bebington, Wirral, which was overseen by 14 witnesses. He experienced emotional and mental fatigue, with the sixth to seventh-hour mark being the ""toughest."" He explained: ""I had this niggling injury near my bicep and it was just playing up all the time. And it got to that six/seven hour marker and I thought, I'm not going to be able to do this - the pain was around a nine out of 10.

""I remember my wife (Lucy) came over to me and and knew just by the look on my face that I was in a bad place, but I said I'm going to carry on going until my bicep pings off the arm."" The pain subsided and Mr Haldon said the experience has taught him a valuable lesson about mental health. ""With mental health, in a tough moment, it won't always be that hard""¦ if you can push through that, it will get better,"" he said.

Money raised from the challenge is to go to mental health charity Movember, with Mr Haldon also becoming the UK's biggest fundraiser for Movember 2023. He said that being recognised with titles and accolades has been ""brilliant"", but he hopes that raising awareness for men's mental health is something that the campaign achieves as well.

""Obviously that's difficult to measure,"" he said. ""But I got to meet some great people and have amazing conversations along the way. I did a walk with someone who works with Movember who does crazy challenges, and two of the world's strongest men, who struggled with mental health. ""Having all these conversations and meeting all these people along this journey was just such a great thing that I didn't expect to happen as part of the fundraising.""

His training involved lots of walks with weights, often three to four times a week, and lots of strength work including pull-ups and barbell rows, as well as having a focus on protein when it came to nutrition. He added that the team at Myprotein has also been a ""great"" support and connected him with other men in the industry who have struggled with their mental health and want to raise awareness about it. He said training was mainly ""intuitive"" because there's ""no real blueprint"" for how to prepare your body for a feat like this and a big chunk was also mental.

He explained: ""You're going out and spending hours and hours with two handles, on my own, in my own head, with my own thoughts, no screen time, no conversation and in a world that is very fast paced, it is very rare that we spend a lot of time with ourselves. The training was actually harder than the actual day because on the day I had loads of people cheering for me, whereas when I was training I had no support, no claps, no instant gratification.""

For those who have testicular cancer or think they may have it, Mr Haldon said: ""Just never ever be embarrassed. I think that's the biggest thing - the embarrassment of it - because I think the only time guys really speak about their private parts is as a bit of banter and there's never really serious conversations to be had about it, which probably creates a bit of a stigma. When I put a post up on Instagram about the day I was going into surgery, I spoke to over 100 guys who messaged me about checking or having gone through testicular cancer and I think it's powerful how much a conversation can remove a weight from you.""

'I just burst into tears,' says Downton Abbey star Lesley Nicol when she learned of the plight of Asia's black bears who are held in cruel conditions and farmed for their bile

It was a heartbreaking scene that made Downton Abbey's Mrs Patmore boil with rage.

When actress Lesley Nicol, who played the drama's bustling cook, saw a video of the abuse of bears 6,000 miles away in Vietnam and China she knew instantly she had to do something about it.

It led to the star becoming a key ingredient in a campaign to save them - and, in typical Mrs Patmore fashion, Lesley rounded up fellow cast members to help out too. Now their efforts have helped save 130 Asiatic black bears caught and farmed for their bile, which is used in traditional Chinese medicine. And the power behind their success has been driven by the massive fanbase Downton Abbey has in Asia.

The scene was set back in 2012 when Lesley and late husband David Heald - Darbs - were relaxing at home one day and she saw a video tweeted by actor pal Peter Egan. ""It showed one of these bears being released from its cage, swimming around in a pool, and I just burst into tears,"" says Lesley.

""That bear hooked my heart. I told Darbs we just had to do something."" Lesley contacted Jill Robinson, the founder of Animals Asia which leads a campaign to end the farming trade for bear bile.

""Downton had a Chinese audience of 160 million, so Jill was delighted to have me on board,"" says Lesley, 70. ""I promised to rope in other actors from the series and they all jumped on board too, making videos. Saving these bears became everything to Darbs and me. They are snatched from the wild, trapped in tiny cages, unable to stand on all fours. They exist in unimaginable pain, their bodies abused and broken. And they are kept in a constant state of hunger and thirst, as it's said to make their bile more effective for traditional remedies.""

Animal Asia had persuaded a bear bile farm near Nanning in China to renounce the trade and become a sanctuary for its 130 black bears - also known as moon bears for the cream-coloured crescents on their chests. So the couple and their famous pals joined the charity's £3million fundraising effort to help make it a reality. Downton stars including Jim Carter ( Mr Carson), Brendan Coyle (John Bates), Joanne Froggatt (Anna Smith), Rob James-Collier (Thomas Barrow) and Sophie McShera (Daisy) filmed a video in costume in the servants' hall on the Downton Abbey set to promote the Nanning project.

""It was beautiful,"" says Lesley. ""And Raquel Cassidy, who plays Lady Grantham's maid Miss Baxter, asked wardrobe to make a banner saying ""˜We love bears' which we all held up. Lesley says pal Peter, who appeared in the 2012 Downton Christmas special, has ""infectious"" enthusiasm for the cause.

""He told me once you've seen them, the bears get into your heart,"" she says. The following year Lesley and Darbs visited a makeshift animal hospital on China's border with Vietnam - helping AA vets carry out health checks on the animals. She says: ""It was mind-blowing.""

Meanwhile, the ""˜Downton effect' has also helped AA's efforts in Vietnam to reduce thousands of bears tortured for bile to just 300. Bile farming has been illegal in Vietnam since 2005, but a legal loophole lets farmers keep the bears as ""pets"" - secretly continuing the trade. Now AA and the Vietnam government have made an agreement to stamp this out - again with the help of Downton Abbey.

""Because I played Mrs Patmore I had more gravitas in Asia than many much bigger stars,"" says Lesley. ""I was happy to do whatever it took."" Lesley and Darbs remained passionately involved with the charity until he died in May 2022 at 68 after posting on Facebook that he had caught Covid. A spiritual healer, he and Lesley married in 2007. She says: ""Losing Darbs ripped me to pieces.""

Last month Lesley flew to Bach Ma in Vietnam, where AA is building a 32 acre sanctuary for 400 rescued bears. She says: ""I am still grieving, but I want to carry on the work we started together."" While there she saw a rescued bear called King in quarantine that stood out for her. ""I said to Jill, ""˜My God, is it just me? Who does he remind you of?' Jill said, ""˜Darbs, he's the spitting image.'""

Now Lesley has adopted the bear and renamed him King Darbs. She says: ""King Darbs has this swagger about him. He's a bit of a charming poser like Darbs was."" Lesley is now back at work playing sub-postmaster Pam Stubbs in three-part ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office starting on January 1, based on the wrongly jailed postmasters scandal.

But she remains solidly committed to her cause. She says: ""It blows me away that bears abused for so many years let you go up close and give them something to eat. They're so stoic and forgiving.""

While the Vietnamese bile bear industry appears to be coming to an end, Lesley acknowledges there is still a lot of work to be done in China and other South East Asian countries, where around 10,000 moon bears are still being farmed.

Her latest visit to Vietnam coincides with the charity's new No Bear Left Behind campaign supported by video messages from celebrities including Dame Judi Dench, Ricky Gervais, Stephen Fry and Alan Cumming.

Tortured for the sake of 'tonics'

Tortured in the name of medicine, the bears have crude catheters stuck into their abdomens to extract bile from their gall bladders. It contains ursodeoxycholic acid that helps animals avoid problems with gallstones during hibernation.

The bile sells for around £10 a millilitre and is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat everything from haemorrhoids and sore throats to hangovers. It's taken in teas, tonics and wines, as well as in tablet form, face packs, toothpaste and shampoo.

Britain has one of the world's highest seizure rates of products with bear bile. Selling them can lead to five years' jail.

John William Britton was captured by the Nazis at the start of World War II in Norway. Later in those sturdy boots he was forced to march for miles across Germany and parts of Poland

Malcolm Britton remembers his father wearing his old leather and felt boots as they trudged through the heavy snow together when he was a little boy.

It was too deep for Malcolm but his dad Jack had suffered much worse in those very same boots as a Prisoner of War for five long years from 1940 to 1945.

John William Britton, always known as Jack Britton, was captured by the Nazis at the start of World War II in Norway. Later in those sturdy boots he was forced to march for miles across Germany and parts of Poland.

For this reason Malcolm, who lives in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, appears on tonight's episode of BBC One's The Repair Shop asking the expers to mend the German-made boots which were given to his dad some time during his captivity, and kept him striding forward amidst unimaginable adversity.

Malcolm explains what the footwear means to him: ""It's not only memories of the war but memories of my childhood as well and honouring what he'd gone through.""

Malcolm, 77 and a former lecturer at an agricultural college, is brought to tears in the Repair Shop barn as he reveals to cobbler Dean Westmoreland and host Jay Blades some of the journeys his father had to struggle through while wearing the thick boots.

Reading an extract written from a small daily diary his father kept, Malcolm says, ""The Germans put us 7,000 men to march by night towards south Germany. Marching by night, sleeping by day outside or in barns. Through exposure hands, lips, face badly chapped. I had dysentery most of the way same as ninety percent of the others.""

Another extract from the precious diary reads: ""Being without grub and cigs, weight dropped from 80 kilograms to 65 kilograms. Everyone walking skeletons. What a nightmare. Sole topic is grub. Never expected after five years in prison to again experience such a terrible time. Weather and winter have been particularly savage, and my toes are still frozen after five months.""

To Malcolm the boots embody the resilience of his father, who barely spoke about his wartime experience where he suffered long periods of starvation and horrific conditions. ""When I was about two years old he was in and out of hospital. I went to visit him in hospital with my mum and remember him saying he was ""˜proper poorly.' I'll always remember that expression. He rarely spoke about the war which I think is common for most people who've been through it.""

Shoe expert Dean restores the boots to their former glory by filling the moth holes, restitching the heel, and repairing their soles. Upon seeing the finished product a delighted Malcolm says: ""They are so important to me, the boots, because they are a tangible reminder of dad who died many years ago now, but also remembering what he went through in the war. By association we can not forget what went on before.""

Aside from being kept out of the way of the moths from here on out, the boots are now being enjoyed by Jack's six grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.

""Whenever any of his grandchildren or great grandchildren turn up here, they try them on and take photographs in the boots. They go through the diary and the stories and things like that so they have got a greater understanding of their heritage.""

411,"UK joins super-trade deal with countries including Mexico, Vietnam and Chile","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/uk-join-super-trade-deal-29593065","UK joins super-trade deal with countries including Mexico, Vietnam and Chile

The country will become the first in Europe to join the huge trade bloc in the Indo-Pacific, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership

The UK has joined a new super-trade deal with countries including Mexico, Vietnam and Chile after nearly two years of negotiations.

The country will become the first in Europe to join the huge trade bloc in the Indo-Pacific, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).

It is the UK's biggest trade deal since Brexit and is set to slash red tape for UK firms in growing Pacific markets.

The historic agreement, which will see the bloc's total GDP hit £11trillion, follows two years of intense negotiations by the Department for Business and Trade.

The UK will now join the 11 Pacific nations in the pact, which formed in 2018, including Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.

Ministers say joining the CPTPP could give UK businesses tariff-free access on more than 99% of goods that enter a market of around 500 million customers.

Likewise they say membership is a ""gateway"" to the wider Indo-Pacific region, which has 60% of the world's population and is set to account for the majority (54%) of global economic growth in the decades ahead.

A possible deal had already come under some criticism with farmers raising the alarm that Britain could be flooded with meat from countries with weaker welfare standards under the pact earlier this month.

No10 yesterday said the agreement will protect the UK's vital industries, including agriculture and the NHS, and will uphold high animal welfare and food safety standards.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: ""We are at our heart an open and free-trading nation, and this deal demonstrates the real economic benefits of our post-Brexit freedoms. As part of CPTPP, the UK is now in a prime position in the global economy to seize opportunities for new jobs, growth and innovation.

""Joining the CPTPP trade bloc puts the UK at the centre of a dynamic and growing group of Pacific economies, as the first new nation and first European country to join. British businesses will now enjoy unparalleled access to markets from Europe to the south Pacific.""

Business and Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch said: ""This is an important moment for the UK. Our accession to CPTPP sends a powerful signal that the UK is open for business and using our post-Brexit freedoms to reach out to new markets around the world and grow our economy.

""Joining CPTPP will support jobs and create opportunities for companies of all sizes and in all parts of the UK. It is about giving British businesses improved access to the countries that will be gateway to the wider Indo-Pacific region which is projected to make up the majority of global growth in the future.""

But Lib Dem trade spokeswoman Sarah Green said: ""This Conservative government is responsible for some shocking trade deals that fail to add economic benefit to the UK.

""We have seen in the UK our businesses tangled in red tape and farmers abandoned.

""The Conservatives have trashed the British economy with GDP stagnant and this announcement will not even repair a fraction of their damage.

""People need help with soaring energy bills not empty promises years down the line.""

Three North Korean nationals communicated in secret to reveal the post-Covid disaster inside what has become the most secretive and closed-off state in the world

A North Korean mother and her son starved to death after she was sentenced to hard labour for violating Covid rules, a new investigation has revealed.

People in the highly controlled state have risked their lives to tell the BBC how food is now so scarce that their neighbours have starved to death.

Three North Korean nationals communicated in secret to reveal the post-Covid disaster inside what has become the most secretive and closed-off state in the world.

A construction worker, using the fake name Chan Ho, who lives near the Chinese border said food supplies were so low that five people in his village had already died from starvation.

One mother was sentenced to hard labour for violating quarantine rules, and soon after she and her son starved to death.

Another mother and child died after she had become too sick to work.

""Her children kept her alive for as long as they could by begging for food, but in the end, all three died"", the BBC wrote.

Chan Ho said he used to be afraid of dying from Covid but now he has ""begun to worry about starving to death"" instead.

Under the guise of shielding themselves from Covid, the state's decision to close borders has enabled authorities to stop importing grain from China, as well as the fertilisers and machinery needed to grow food, leading to the starvation of many.

People fear history repeating itself and unsettling memories of the devastating famine that ravaged the country in the 1990s, killing around three million, are haunting.

One woman, Ji Yeon, said she is haunted by the week she had to eat puljuk - a mash of vegetables, plants and grass, ground into a porridge-like paste.

Lucas Rengifo-Keller, a research analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN in March that trade data, satellite images and assessments by the United Nations and South Korean authorities all suggest the food supply has now ""dipped below the amount needed to satisfy minimum human needs.""

Even before the Covid pandemic, nearly half of the North Korean population was undernourished, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.

Instead of spending money on bolstering the country's waning food supply, brute leader Kim Jong-Un has instead carried out a record number of missile tests.

Chan Ho said his friend's son had recently witnessed several closed-door executions. In each one, three to four people had been killed for attempting to escape the country.

He said: ""Every day it gets harder to live. One wrong move and you are facing execution.""

When the BBC put the accusations to the North Korean government, they claimed that their people's ""well-being is our foremost priority"".

They also said the information was ""not entirely factual"", claiming it had been ""derived from fabricated testimonies from anti-DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] forces.""

""The North Korean borders need to open and they need to restart trade and they need to bring these things in for agriculture to improve and they need food to feed the people.

But right now they are prioritising isolation, they are prioritising repression"", Lina Yoon, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch told CNN.

413,"Russia denies reports Vladimir Putin died from cancer today calling it 'absurd information'","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-denies-reports-putin-died-31291312","Russia denies reports Vladimir Putin died from cancer today calling it 'absurd information'

A spokesperson for Vladimir Putin said the report the world leader had died was an ""absurd information canard"" despite Telegram channel General SVR claiming for months Putin has been ill

The Kremlin tonight issued an extraordinary denial that Vladimir Putin had died today at his Valdai residence north of Moscow.

A report of his death was published by Telegram channel General SVR which has long claimed the Russian dictator has suffered from cancer and was terminally ill. The channel also alleged that a ""coup"" was underway in Russia as 71-year-old Putin's entourage sought to pass off his body double as the real president.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state media RIA Novosti that the report was an ""absurd information canard"". Earlier this week he had strongly denied Putin suffered a heart attack last weekend, and said reports the Russian president used a doppelgÃ¤nger were false.

One theory is that the channel is funded by figures once close to Putin who have lost ground, and that the false report is evidence of an intense power struggle as Russia struggles in its war in Ukraine. There are claims that elements of the GRU military intelligence may be involved.

The full report from General SVR read: ""Attention! There is currently an attempted coup in Russia! Russian President Vladimir Putin died this evening at his residence in Valdai. At 20.42 Moscow time, doctors stopped resuscitation and pronounced death.

""Now the doctors are blocked in the room with Putin's corpse, they are being held by members of the presidential security service on the personal orders of Dmitry Kochnev [director of the Federal Guard Service], who is in touch and receives instructions from the Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Nikolai Patrushev. Security for the president's double has been beefed up.""Œ Active negotiations are underway. Any attempt to pass off a double as the president after Putin's death is a coup.""

Patrushev, 72, is secretary of Russia's powerful Security Council, and Putin's top intelligence advisor. General SVR has claimed he is in pole position to succeed the president but may wish power for his son, agriculture minister Dmitry Patrushev, 46.

The channel has claimed for months that Putin was ill and replaced by actors trained by the security services who underwent plastic surgery to look like the dictator. The same theory has been espoused by Valery Solovey, a former professor at Moscow's prestigious Institute of International Relations [MGIMO], a training academy for spies and diplomats.

He said recently: ""The fact is that the current President Vladimir Putin is living out the last days of his earthly life."" The head of Ukrainian military intelligence Lt-Gen Kyrylo Budanov has alleged the real Putin has not been seen since June 2022.

""The one, who everyone used to know, was last seen around 26 June 2022,"" he said last month. A recent Japanese TV report used AI to analyse Putin's face, walk and voice in multiple appearances, and concluded that he does use one and perhaps two body doubles. I can tell you there are no doubles when it comes to work and so on,"" said spokesman Peskov earlier this week.

Specifically on the heart problems, Peskov said: ""He is well - this is no more than just another canard."" The spokesman said: ""These [kinds of stories] belong to the category of fake news, discussed with enviable tenacity by a number of media outlets. This brings nothing but a smile [in the Kremlin].""

In April, Peskov admitted that reports were rife about Putin's doppelgÃ¤ngers but claimed the warmonger was ""mega-active"".

""Perhaps you had heard that Putin has multiple doubles, who work instead of him while he is sitting inside a bunker,"" he said. ""This is yet more lies. This is one more lie. You see our president. He is just as he used to be - mega-active.""

The channel is supposedly run by a former Kremlin lieutenant-general, known by the alias Viktor Mikhailovich. It claims Putin's top apparatchiks and security henchmen control the activities of the doppelgÃ¤ngers.

Divers from the local police force revealed they are inspecting a lake next to a public swimming pool in the tiny hamlet for the second time, in the search for Emile Soleil

There is fresh hope for answers in the hunt for a little boy who vanished without a trace.

Divers from the local police force in France revealed they are inspecting a lake next to a public swimming pool in the tiny hamlet for the second time, going back to make sure they have investigated it properly. Emile Soleil, two, was staying with his grandparents in Haut-Vernet, an Alpine hamlet south of Grenoble when he vanished.

Some scenarios have already been ruled out, such as a bird of prey or wolf attack. A total of 20 houses have been searched, but nothing was found. Now the police are investigating the scenario in which Ã‰mile would have come into contact with an agricultural machine. A farmer from the village of Le Vernet, where the search is taking place, told BFMTV that it would not be an illogical scenario. Prosecutor Remy Avon said officers are looking to ""investigate causes of the worrying disappearance.""

He said the possibilities that Ã‰mile had been murdered, kidnapped, or got involved in an accident were all being looked at. ""All these theories are active,"" said Mr Avon. ""Nothing has been ruled out."" After an apparent lull in the investigation, detectives have now turned their attention to a house just a few hundred metres away from the family home, BFM DICI reports.

French media outlets are reporting that shortly after Emile went missing, a sonar device detected an anomaly on the slab. Searches of the area have since been made. After days of thorough searches over the summer, a spokesman said: ""Either the body was concealed after an accident, or it was removed.""

The police have released a photo and description of Emile, who is almost 3ft tall, with brown eyes, and blond hair. He was wearing a yellow top, white shorts with a green pattern, and hiking shoes at the time of his disappearance.

415,"Russia 'keen to end Ukraine war and rejoin international community' if Putin is dead","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-keen-end-ukraine-war-31295369","Russia 'keen to end Ukraine war and rejoin international community' if Putin is dead

World affairs expert Anthony Glees says a new leader in Russia would likely look to end the war in Ukraine, if the Kremlin has its choice - that's if rumours of Vladimir Putin's death are true

A new leader in Russia would likely be keen to end the war in Ukraine and allow the country to rejoin the international community - if Vladimir Putin has really died, according to a world affairs expert.

Prof Anthony Glees, security and intelligence expert at the University of Buckingham, says a power handover would potentially see a shift back towards the West in an effort to end damaging economical sanctions imposed.

Rumours have been rife for months about the Russian President's allegedly declining health, with Telegram channel General SVR - claiming he suffered a cardiac arrest at his Moscow home last weekend. The channel claims it has a source inside the 71-year-old dictator's entourage, though the Kremlin swiftly denied he had fallen ill, before further unconfirmed reports claimed Putin had died.

Prof Glees said there is a very good chance Putin is dead and may have been for some time. He told the Mirror: ""A Kremlin denial is not worth a row of beans. This is a world of whispers, this is a wilderness of mirrors, trying to pick up the reflection. So you then come onto the question of who would replace him if he really was dead?"" He has named the two likely candidates to take over from Putin if he has died. They are Ramzan Akhmadovich Kadyrov, Head of the Chechen Republic, and Dmitry Patrushev, Russia's Minister of Agriculture. He described them as the ""only two people who come into the picture"".

He said Patrushev is ""deeply embedded in Putin's system"". He continued: ""He is clearly trusted by Putin. He's quite young, he's 46 years old, he's got that look about him that suggests that he is a likely candidate. On the other hand, you've got that awful Chechen warlord Akhmadovich Kadyrov, who's 47, great big fat freak and killer. He is a thug, a thoroughly nasty piece of work.

""If there were a coup against Putin, against those people trying to pretend he's not dead or very ill. That would be the Chechen warlord, he's a man of action and has troops behind him. If, on the other hand, we are seeing a Soviet style transfer of power, the Kremlin are calling the shots, they are framing the narrative, they want to pace it, then I think it's Patrushev.""

Prof Glees said another problem with Kadyrov is there are rumours his health is poor and he has kidney problems, as well as being ""very overweight"". In terms of what is in the best interests of the West, he said Patrushev is ""more likely to be somebody you could do a deal with"".

""If Patrushev has any sense, and he looks to me like he's a smart cookie, he's doing the right things. He's the person the West would like. Kadyrov, on the other hand, he's basically a chaos merchant. He hasn't got the skills that propelled Putin to the top that were recognised early on by the KGB. He's a smart man, Putin, he knows how to manipulate people and to buy people off, bribe people. Patrushev knows all this, but Kadyrov is a thug, he only knows how to blow people up.""

He continued: ""There's that fear of don't let go of Putin for finding something worse but worse than Putin doesn't exist, he's as bad as you get. Putin is a coldblooded, calculated killer, I don't think Patrushev is and I don't think Kadyrov is coldblooded, I think he's hot blooded, and in the end hot blooded people don't do terribly well.""

Referring to the Ukraine war, he said there's a good chance a new leader brings it to an end. ""Putin is so bogged down in it, it either ends in his victory or his death. One way or another, and it's not going to be his victory, NATO is not going to let him win. It's not going to happen and he's not going to use nuclear weapons, because if he was, he would have done it already.""

Asked how an end to the war could come about and when, if indeed a new leader is brought in shortly, Prof Glees said: ""There's this phrase 'General Winter', the bitter cold in eastern Europe will freeze the fighting more or less where it is. We're not far off that point. It gets colder and colder, and once General Winter hits, that would be a good time to change over. The Russians have got territory, a new leader could barter.

""He wouldn't necessarily have to win, he could say give us a bit and we'll go away. People might lean on Zelensky and say there are one or two places, Crimea is one of them. A deal could be done with a new leader. That would make sense for the West, because if we've got this business in the Middle East to contend with it would be very much in our interests that the Ukraine war comes to an end.""

He added: ""These sanctions are hitting Russia and hitting Russians, the state controlled media says they've got their national identity back but in the end forgive the cliche but 'it's the economy, stupid'. And that applies to Russia as it does to anywhere else. It was the economy that brought the Soviets down, that was it. It was the fact that people couldn't buy stuff and they saw people in the West could buy stuff.

""It's terrible news from the battle front, Ukraine has punched a hole in Russia's three line defences, they are carrying out all these skirmishes on the other side of the river, Biden's giving them all the arms they want. With a new leader you've got a fresh start, we can offer Russia a way back into the community of nations again. You'd have to be stark stirring mad not to go for that. It cannot be done with Putin there, he is so deeply entrenched. But if there's a biological solution to the problem of Putin we should cheering.""

Rachel Elnaugh, who was one of the five investors in the first two seasons of the hit BBC show, intends to turn the land into an eco-farm and retreat for followers of her group who allegedly believe in a 'food apocalypse' and the 'great reset'

Officials have destroyed a former Dragon's Den star's controversial sanctuary in the Peak District.

Rachel Elnaugh was one of the original five investors and starred in the first two seasons of the hit BBC show, alongside Duncan Bannatyne, Simon Woodroffe, Peter Jones and Doug Richard.

But her business, Red Letter Days, went into administration in 2005 after suffering ""cash flow difficulties"" that could not be cured without further cash injections.

She purchased 70 acres of protected land including ancient trees and unimproved grassland in Cressbrook Dale, a limestone gorge near Bakewell, Derbyshire, which she refers to as an ""incredible vagina of land"".

Her declared intentions with the land have changed over time, and locals fear she intends to turn it into an eco-farm and retreat for followers of her group, the ""Inner Sanctum"", who allegedly believe in a ""food apocalypse"" and the ""great reset"".

But the supposed plan came undone when the Peak National Park Authority issued an official enforcement notice stating the group had to return the land to its original state.

On December 14, officials confirmed that it had removed a large tipi and a car parking area containing plastic material filled with stone from the site, reports the Derbyshire Times.

Patrick Brady, chair of the authority's planning committee, told the paper: ""These things take time to resolve, but I am grateful to Cressbrook residents for their determination to ensure that this precious area is looked after for the future and for highlighting the importance of an adequately resourced and effective planning enforcement service. We intend to build on this for the future.""

Rachel previously hit back at a local campaign group, Save Cressbrook Dale, claiming that the council's intervention is a result of a 'hate campaign' by the group.

Speaking to the Mirror previously, Rachel said: ""I am dismayed at the depths to which the Cressbrook local community have stopped in what is now clearly a hate campaign directed at me personally.

""I am currently compiling evidence for a private prosecution of those involved.

""I am not authorised to comment on behalf of the co-owners, some of whom are elderly with walking disabilities - however I do wonder whether their right - to freely and safely access the land which they own - have been considered by those attempting to deny those rights?""

The notice, seen by The Mirror, states that there has been a breach of planning protocol on the land, and a vehicle parking area, some steps, a path, and a tipi must be removed.

The notice went on to describe the land in question as a part of a 'natural zone', subject to specific restrictions.

A spokesperson for the Save Cressbrook Dale group previously told the Mirror: ""We see it as the right thing - the quote that is in the notice about the importance of the landscape and maintaining access is what our campaign has all been about, so it's validation of that really.

""She has the right of appeal and she could appeal the notice, it's hard to know what motivates her and how she works.

""The notice means she has to remove everything noted in the enforcement notice - the steps, the parking, the teepee, there are a few things that have been left out like the caravan and the pond that they put in - they have been left out of the enforcement notice, we are talking to peak park about that.""

Rachel Elnaugh became a celebrity of sorts when she appeared on the BBC game show where she competed to invest in new businesses alongside her fellow dragons.

The businesswoman, who starred in the first two series of the show and was initially the only female investor, founded Red Letter Days in 1989 which became a whopping success with a turnover of £18m.

But it eventually faltered and she left the show before her company finally went into administration leaving behind a series of unpaid suppliers and disappointed customers.

Since then she aired her controversial views on the Covid vaccination programme - and sparked outrage when she called for Chris Whitty to hang, calling jabs of 12-15-year-olds ""child abuse"".

She also snapped up the ancient and protected woodland in the Peak District, angering locals and the local authority in the process.

John Butler, chair of the Cressbrook community group and lead spokesperson for the Save Cressbrook Dale campaign, previously spoke to The Mirror.

He has lived in the area for the past 50 years and regularly enjoyed walking through the dale - which he described as a ""crown jewel of the Peak District National Park"" - but he fears for its future.

He said: ""It's not clear what she intends to do with the land, it seems to be changing.

""The original intention that was expressed was to establish a self-sufficient eco-community on the land.

""They had a million-pound business plan in order to bring that to fruition, which included quite a lot of infrastructure that they were going to install, including wind turbines, greenhouses and polytunnels, alongside £90,000 worth of movable structures.

""So at that point, it looked like they were building a settlement on the land. However, it was clear right from the outset that the land is simply not fit for that purpose.

""It's not fertile agricultural land, most of it is ancient woodland, there's 70 acres altogether and 50 are just woodland.

""Some is marginal grazing land, it's very poor soil and unimproved land, so it's never been cultivated in a serious way - so it's not remotely capable of producing viable crops for a self-sufficient community.""

In a letter, Rachel explained to local residents that she had bought the land and stated that she wanted to ""get as much as we can planted for this growing season.""

She stated that it was her intention to ""create a fully self-sustaining 'food-apocalypse-proof' site"", and invited them to ""be part of our growing community of open-hearted souls"".

Rachel's prospectus states that her aim is to ""build a better world"" away from ""polarization of rich and poor"" (sic) and ""ecological devastation"".

After obtaining the land, Rachel posted on Facebook: ""Given the predicted food apocalypse, one of our first priorities will be to create a food forest across the land to nourish the entire Cressbrook community.""

In a version of the prospectus, that has been seen by The Mirror, she encourages people to invest the project, stating that for anything from £20,000 up to £100,000 you could become a ""founding freeholder"".

This entitles the investor to ""access to Cressbrook Dale Estate for yourself and your immediate family"", alongside ""rights to any produce of the land"", including ""wood, vegetables, foraging, natural water"".

The prospectus states that these rights ""will continue, in perpetuity, for the heirs/descendants of the founding Freeholders.""

The document also hints at the structure of the organisation, with ""potentially thousands"" of micro freeholders on the outside of the sphere, or bottom of the pyramid, 15-55 elite ""founding freeholders"", and a group of six who make up the ""Core Mandala""

It states: ""The Core Mandala (aka Phoenix Rose) is the group of six women who both held the vision to manifest this land, as well as being committed to investing, plus having a future involvement in the ongoing management/enhancement of Cressbrook Dale Estate.

""Micro-Freeholders are by-invitation-only visitors over time who will enjoy limited rights to access, for example, a weekend's camping or a shamanic retreat - ensuring that Cressbrook Dale Estate may be enjoyed by many thousands of people over the years, in return for a reasonable amount of financial resources.""

The Core Mandala consists of Rachel Elnaugh, Janet Spence, Leila Rose, Mog Fry, Angela Harrison, and Davina Mackail.

On her website, Rachel writes about the ""Inner Sanctum"", which is on the quest to establish ""several eco-communities across the UK"" where people pool their resources to acquire land.

She wrote: ""I am delighted to let you know that on June 7, 2022, we acquired Cressbrook Dale Estate - a breathtaking c70 acre site near to Monsal Head in the Peak District National Park, Derbyshire UK.

""This opportunity came about quite by chance via one of our local Bakewell 'Stand in the Park' regulars who knew the estate management team at Stanton Estate.

""They had acquired the land when the Cressbrook Mill went bankrupt in the 1930's, had found it difficult to manage, but wanted it to go to a good home.

""The opportunity necessitated a complete shift in our initial vision - as although all c50 acres of forest and c20 acres of pastureland is agricultural there are no farm buildings on site.

""However it is rich in all the resources required for self-sustainability with natural springs plenty of wood and sheltered from the harsher elements of weather.

""We're managing it remotely for now and hope to rent or buy properties in the area as a closer base for those wishing to be on-site more regularly.""

The website also included the words to the 'prayer of the seven galactic directions', and went on to explain how she made a spiritual offering to the land.

Some locals claim the ""inner sanctum"" is a cult where people believe the UK is heading to a food apocalypse.

John has said previously: ""What you and I might think of as a cult, people within might think of it as a loving community, certainly she was talking to an audience who had feared apocalyptic change for sure, and were attracted by the thought of some kind of retreat from that.

""She's a very persuasive speaker. If you're susceptible to that kind of spin, she's very convincing.

""If you take a deep breath and think now hang on a minute, there will be many of us that have a bit of anxiety about that, but that leading you to an idea that the World Economic Forum is organising a program of extermination or a population cull is many steps too far for me.

""I think, I'm speculating and inferring from what she's saying and what she's not saying, her focus has now changed from agriculture towards an assertion to the land they've bought or in the process of buying is some sort of natural temple.

""She has very repeatedly referred to it as 'the great vagina', I think she's moving towards an esoteric healing community centre. She hasn't said that explicitly, let me make that clear.

""I think the plan would depend on the capacity for the land to become a campsite, and there are strict regulations about how much camping is permitted on this land, as well as requirements for sanitation, water supply, all that kind of thing.

Cressbrook Dale is a limestone valley and sits between Bakewell and Buxton, near Matlock, and the woodland in question is home to a rare species of moss and two types of butterfly, the Dark Green Fritillary and the White-letter Hairstreak.

It provides a unique habitat for local flora and fauna and as such, the area is subject to a Tree Preservation Order protecting the trees and woodland.

It is also designated as part of the Natural Zone, the highest level of conservation protection in the Peak District National Park.

Locals claim that all of the stated intentions of the Phoenix Rose community would require a change of use planning approval, and the Peak District National Park Authority has made it clear such approval would not be granted.

But since Rachel bought it in May 2022, she put in a hard-standing car park and installed a caravan and agricultural tools including a polytunnel and a teepee, according to residents.

The local authority warned Rachel that her activities must stop, and when she carried on they issued a Temporary Stop Notice on July 25.

A spokesperson said: ""Following concerns over the nature of activities recently undertaken on land owned in Cressbrook Dale, the Peak District National Park Authority has served a Temporary Stop Notice, issued a Tree Preservation Order and served a Planning Contravention Notice questionnaire to the landowner, who now has a statutory period to respond.

""Senior officers from both the authority's planning and ecology teams have also engaged with the landowner to discuss the works, and explain the importance of the sensitive habitats and the landscape value of the area.""

John claims: ""The Peak National Park Authority are monitoring the situation, they issued the temporary stop notice, I guess they were hoping that would be sufficient to deter the new owners and I'm pretty sure that they will at some point take some enforcement action because there is some stuff on the land that has been there for six months, which is illegal.

""The trouble is it's not just our back garden, the fact is that land is heavily protected by the national park, all those items shouldn't be there, there on a piece of open access land, which means that anyone can go through anywhere they want on that land.

""It's because it is one of the last wild spaces and it supports an amazing array of natural flora and fauna. The biodiversity is remarkable there, and that's because it's been unchanged, not dug, up, not cultivated, for a very long time.

""Everything they have done to the land so far, which is clearly the beginning of their plans, has been detrimental to the land because of its fragility.

""When you look into it and think why was this land given this level of protection, what makes it so special, you see that everything they've done is quite unacceptable.""

Annie Sanderson, 66, a resident in Cressbrook, described the project as a ""disaster"". She said: ""The dale is beautiful, it is why people moved here. We were given no consultation, we just started seeing videos being posted by this group about a food apocalypse"".

On Rachel's website, she also talks about ""PsyOps"" being used to ""manipulate the masses"" and win elections, describing it as the "" day democracy died "".

Lynn Crowe, a local resident and emeritus professor of environmental management at Sheffield Hallam University, said: ""These limestone dales are the closest thing that we have to true wilderness in the area.

""They are home to different species of orchid and rare butterflies including the Dark Green Fritillary and the White-letter Hairstreak.

""The area needs to be protected as a precious last refuge for wildlife, and so that the area remains accessible to walkers and nature lovers who come to enjoy the tranquillity and solitude of the area.""

Babycham was originally developed in the 1940s but really picked up in popularity in the 1960s, with the iconic coupe glasses often popping up at vintage fairs

Seventies fizzy favourite Babycham is set to make a comeback.

The brand of sparkling perry has been bought out by the brewing family which originally invented it in the late 1940s.

The alcoholic drink, aimed at women, was the first to be advertised on TV, coining the phrase: ""˜I'd love a Babycham.""

More than 140 million bottles with the baby deer logo were sold in 1977, but increased competition led to a steady decline to around 15 million a decade ago.

The Showering family now plan to inject new life into the sparkling tipple, which was the first alcoholic drink advertised on television.

Francis Showering, a trained chemist, invented the pear-based beverage and sold it at agricultural shows in Somerset in the late 1940s.

It won a string of prizes and after the Babycham trademark was registered in 1950, it was released nationally in 1953, with a huge newspaper advertising campaign.

Now it is set for a relaunch with a revamp of the famous green bottle and the Babycham glasses, the originals of which are collectors items.

Matthew Showering, a grandson of Francis, said: ""We will get closer to the original production method and recipe, as some things got chiselled away for speed with mass production.

""We are going towards the original look too.""

The Showering family, based in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, have been in the drinks industry for 14 generations.

They are now back in their original headquarters, featuring a decades-old 15ft statue of the Babycham fawn.

Matthew, who runs Brothers Drinks Co with his three siblings, said: ""The paint was peeling but we gave it a fantastic spray job and will get it up on the roof again.""

Thousands of residents of the Emilia Romagna region whose houses were flooded last week have lost everything and had to throw away their belongings rendered unusable by a huge quantity of mud

Huge piles of people's belongings will need to be disposed of after they were destroyed by mud during last week's devastating floods in Italy.

Roads in several cities and towns are lined up with clothes, beds, cupboards, sofas, TVs, books, and all sorts of personal items that residents lost during the weather emergency in the northeastern region of Emilia Romagna.

In Faenza, a city in the province of Ravenna, 30 tonnes of rubbish - usually produced in one year - are now amassed along roads and in the outskirts of the town following heavy floods between May 16 and May 17.

Volunteers from Protezione Civile (civil protection) and the army have brought in 50 vehicles in a bid to remove the piles of rubbish from the city.

Just a few kilometres away from the city, a huge dump of people's belongings appeared next to the motorway.

Overall, it is estimated that in the region there are around 100.000 tons of rubbish to be disposed of - the quantity that is normally collected in 10 months in the area, reports the local newspaper Il Resto del Carlino.

Six months' worth of rain fell in just 36 hours last week, causing almost two dozen rivers int he region around Ravenna, Cesena and ForlÃ¬ to burst their banks.

At the weekend, we reported the story of Mirella Berardinelli, a resident of ForlÃ¬, in the Emilia Romagna region, who published videos and photos on social media saying that she has lost everything, including her property and her pets.

Another resident of ForlÃ¬, 34-year-old student Yuri Galeotti, said he felt ""lucky"" as he lives on the third floor of his building and while the basement was flooded, water did not reach his flat.

He told The Local: ""All the neighbours who are on the ground or first floors had two metres of water, and everything has to be thrown away.""

After the floods, residents of areas badly hit and those from nearby towns joined in efforts to clear roads and people's homes with shovels and tractors.

Moving images from the area show people of all ages helping each other in an effort to assist those who lost everything during the tragic weather emergency.

Floods have also had a devastating impact on agriculture, with local officials saying that at least 10 million fruit trees, including peach, apricot and kiwi, will need to be wiped out as they were irremediably damaged.

Emilia Romagna is among the main producers of fruit and wheat in Europe and farmers are among the victims of floods, losing their income and livelihood.

It is estimated that at least 50,000 jobs in the agriculture sector are now at risk, reports the Italian news agency Ansa.

Residents have also been warned of the risk of infections and bacteria spreading through contaminated water.

Starting from tomorrow, those living in Conselice, in the Po River Valley, in the province of Ravenna, will be given anti-tetanus vaccinations.

Authorities have warned that due to contaminated water, there is also a risk of gastrointestinal infections whose most common symptoms are vomit and diarrhoea.

Officials warned: ""Remember not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth with muddy hands and whenever possible wash with soap and water.""

There is also a risk that mould and spores that are dangerous for people's health could emerge in properties that were hit by the floods.

An expert has warned a massive rock the size of the Isle of Man could fall into the Atlantic Ocean any day, sending a massive wall of deadly water speeding towards the UK

An expert has warned a mega tsunami could hit Britain ""at any time"", obliterating coastal towns and cities and sending millions to watery graves.

Sir David King, who once served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK government, says the wall of water could be triggered by a huge landslide in the Canary Islands.

The resulting devastation would send a rock the size of the Isle of Man into the Atlantic Ocean with a tsunami several metres high sent plummeting towards the UK.

Millions in towns and cities such as Brighton, Southampton, Bournemouth, Portsmouth and Exeter would be wiped out, with the flood reaching further inland to London.

Sir David told My London: ""After the landslide in the Canary Islands, it would take roughly six hours for the wave to reach the UK.

""That might sound like a long time to give people to escape, but there are other places where people had longer to flee yet many people still died.

""What would happen in London is that everyone would get into their cars all at once to escape the city and they'd block all the roads.

""People wouldn't be able to get out in time and they would essentially die in their cars.""

""In the case of tsunamis, the shallower the waters are, the larger the wave will get.

Once the tsunami passes through the English Channel and into the Thames Estuary, it will grow in size and cause all sorts of destruction in the city.

""It could happen in 10,000 years time, but it could also happen tomorrow.""

The former Professor of Chemistry at the University of East Anglia compares what would happen in London to what happened in Lisbon in 1755.

The Portuguese capital was hit by a wave up to 10 metres high following an earthquake estimated to have had a magnitude of between 8.5 and 9 on the Richter scale, killing up to 100,000 people.

As well as potentially killing a significant amount of people and making families homeless, the scientist also warns of the ecological consequences of a tsunami on Londoners.

He added: ""Salt water coming in from the sea could contaminate some fresh water reserves that Londoners use. There would be some ecological damage to wildlife too.

""On that note, the salt water would also saturate the soil around London.

""The change in salinity levels would mean farmers wouldn't be able to grow crops in the area for many years afterwards, as has been seen in other tsunami-affected regions.""

Water levels have fallen below a critical point for being able to supply cooling water to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, the operator of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine has said

The operator of the Ukrainian dam that was destroyed earlier this week has said water levels have fallen below a critical point for being able to supply cooling water to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station.

The Kakhovka dam on the Dnieper River was destroyed on Tuesday, forcing thousands of people to flee their homes after nearby towns and villages were flooded.

Nuclear power stations require large volumes of water from coasts or estuaries for cooling. If this cooling mechanism fails, the temperature in the nuclear reactor core can rise dangerous high.

Now, there are fears of disasters at Zaporizhzhia as water levels are low in the region.

It comes after the UN's atomic energy watchdog said on Wednesday that work was underway to ensure the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant had enough water in reserve to cool its shut-down reactors, in case supplies fell too much.

Ukrainian MP Kira Rudik said the risk of catastrophe at Zaporizhzhia plant increased after the dam collapse.

She told GB News: ""Radiation does not care which passport you're holding, and are you a member of NATO or you are not.

""So, if there is a tragedy, it will be everybody's problem and it will endanger people throughout Europe.

""And this is why we are calling for the UN forces or the international organisations to put the spectators there to control the nuclear station.

""But as of now, it did not happen. Russia does not allow that. And we are still living under this ticking-time bomb.""

The dam and reservoir, essential for fresh water and irrigation for southern Ukraine, lies in the Kherson region that Moscow illegally annexed in September and has occupied for the past year.

The reservoir is also critical for water supplies to the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.

Ukraine holds the Dnieper's western bank, while Russia controls the low-lying eastern side, which is more vulnerable to flooding.

Experts noted that the 1950s-era dam, about 70 kilometers (44 miles) to the east of the city of Kherson, was believed to be in disrepair and vulnerable to collapse because the water was already brimming over when the wall gave way. It hadn't been producing power since November, according to officials.

The UK Defense Ministry said the Kakhovka reservoir was at record high levels before the breach and that the dam ""is likely to deteriorate further over the next few days, causing additional flooding"".

Today, Russian forces shelled a southern Ukrainian city that was inundated by flooding, forcing a suspension of some rescue efforts hours after President Volodymyr Zelensky went to the area to assess the damage.

The fresh fighting returned security issues to the region, with officials on both sides saying least 14 people were killed in the flooding, thousands were left homeless and tens of thousands are now without drinking water after the collapse.

Kyiv accused Moscow of blowing up the dam and its associated hydropower plant, which the Kremlin's forces controlled, while Russia said Ukraine bombarded it.

The ensuing flooding has ruined crops, displaced land mines, wrought widespread environmental damage, and set the stage for long-term electricity shortages. Exclusive drone footage captured by The Associated Press showed the ruined dam falling into the river and hundreds of submerged homes, greenhouses and even a church.

Otis Walder-Robb, 12, was pulled from a pool by other children in Vietnam on Frida and tragically died, family friends say as they raise funds to bring him home to Thailand

Tributes have been paid to a ""vibrant"" British boy after he died tragically in Vietnam where his parents were volunteering at a summer camp.

Otis Walder-Robb, 12, died on Friday after what's understood to have been a tragic accident in a swimming pool.

The youngster from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, reportedly got into trouble in the pool and was pulled out by other children before being rushed to hospital, but tragically doctors were unable to save him.

The tragedy is the third for Otis' dad Stephen Walder, Yorkshire Live reports, after losing wife Cathy in 2017 and son Reuben, 10, to brain cancer in 2020.

Mr Walder had been in Vietnam teaching at the camp with partner Liz Robb, with the family's shock and grief furthered by being unable to leave the country to get back to Pai, Thailand, where they're currently living.

At present, the couple are unable to access the money to book flights and pay for transfers, as loved ones back home and in Thailand try to support them with a fundraising page set up.

The online appeal is to help pay for Otis' funeral, as well as other travel expenses as they face bringing him home.

The page, set up by Gemma Anjamanee Piya Tora Lewis, said Otis died suddenly ""from a tragic accident"", and his family were still in Vietnam awaiting financial support.

Family friend Rebecca Wegmann meanwhile said it was unclear what had happened to Otis, with police now investigating. She said four children had pulled Otis from a swimming pool with attempts made to revive him at the scene. He died later in hospital.

Writing on the fundraising page, Gemma said: ""Otis Walder-Robb was 12 years old when he took his last breath at 7.57pm on 7-7-2023. We regret to share that his passing was of sudden consequence from a tragic accident. There is grief and deep sorrow amidst the family's hearts, and a growing community is in mourning.

""We wish to use all funding towards the funeral expenses and memorial of Otis, and to cover all travel and health care costs in returning him, his sister Betty, and his parents Steven and Liz, to home soil, so the family and their community can celebrate and hold ceremony for his life.""

She added: ""The family were temporarily visiting Vietnam due to working away at a children's summer camp. We're all desperate to get their 6-year-old daughter back to our community so she can be in a familiar environment with friends who dearly miss her."" The funding page has reached nearly £13,000 and has a target of £20,000.

Friends have posted their own tributes in memory of Otis on the Go Fund Me page. One man called him an 'incredible lad' and other donor said Otis was ""such a vibrant young man.""

Another posted: ""Fly high you amazing boy! You was so loved and so caring by many! My thoughts are with all the family and all the extended family you have made while travelling with the best people Elizabeth Robb and Stephen Walder and little Betty.

""Sending lots of hugs and love! Now you can rest and be with your brother and your mum. You were such a bright caring happy lively boy!""

Prince Harry obviously speaks about wife Meghan Markle the most in his new book - but one of his kids barely gets a mention

Prince Harry has exposed many family secrets in new book Spare - but who does he mention the most?

In his highly-anticipated autobiography Spare, Harry makes allegations against a number of his relatives and speaks about his new life in California.

The Duke of Sussex is well-known for being a friend to the stars, so he obviously drops a lot of celebrity names in, as well as 15 mentions of his privates.

Unsurprisingly, wife Meghan Markle is spoken about more than anyone else, but there are some very surprising results.

Here is a look at who gets mentioned the most times by Harry in Spare.

Meghan Markle - 435

It's obviously Meghan who tops the list - and she's mostly affectionately referred to as 'Megs'.

We discover how they fell in love, their first few dates and the birth of their kids.

Harry speaks about introducing his wife to various royals for the first time, her rows with family members and how they struggled in the early days.

He also cheekily admits that watching his wife's Suits sex scenes was a 'mistake' and how he needed electric shock therapy to get the images out of his head.

Prince William - 358

One person who doesn't come out of Spare very well is Willy, known to us as Prince William.

The heir to the throne is actually only referred to as William on nine occasions, as opposed to the 349 times he is called Willy.

William allegedly pushed him to the floor during a row at his Kensington Palace home, leaving him with a ripped necklace and bruises.

Harry says William and Kate encouraged him to wear a Nazi costume to a fancy dress party, which sparked outrage in 2005.

The Duke discusses being told by William to pretend he didn't know him at Eton and his brother's 'alarming' thinning hair.

Princess Diana - 342

A lot of the book revolves around Harry's mother, who is referred to as 'mummy' 206 times, 'mother' 112 times, 'mum' 19 and Diana five times.

Harry felt like a politician as he greeted members of the public in the wake of her death and walked behind her coffin.

He asked a chauffeur to recreate the night his mum died and drive through the Pont de L'Alma tunnel in Paris.

On 20th anniversary of Diana's death, Meghan kneeled and put her palms on her gravestone to asks for 'clarity and guidance'.

Harry was told he can't be buried with his late mother at her childhood home Althorp House and a psychic with powers told him that his mother was watching over and he was 'living the life she couldn't'.

King Charles - 310

Harry doesn't refer to King Charles as father, dad or even daddy, but instead uses 'Pa' throughout.

King Charles obviously crops up a lot in the book, with Harry writing about the night his father told him that his mother had died and how he did not hug him.

Harry also speaks about Charles trying to keep peace between his sons and the night he first met Meghan.

Charles is said to have told his sons not to make his final years a misery and made a joke to Diana after Harry was born - saying his work was done now he had an heir and a spare.

The King also reportedly jokingly questioned whether he was Harry's father and made a joke in 'poor taste' about rumours James Hewitt is his real dad.

The Queen - 192

Harry has fond memories of his grandmother, particularly at Balmoral, and refers to her as 'Granny'.

There's a funny segment about how he asked the Queen for permission to marry Meghan - and he says she 'stayed silent' during the famous Sandringham Summit.

He also says he found out his grandmother had died by looking at the news online while he flew up to Balmoral.

The Duke was not with Meghan because she was told not to come by Charles - and she text him urging him to call her when the plane landed.

On arriving at her deathbed, he whispered to the Queen that he 'hoped she would be happy'.

Kate Middleton - 104

Harry's sister-in-law is mostly mentioned alongside his brother - and he discusses liking making her laugh.

But then relations started to sour and he details a number of rows between Meghan and the Princess of Wales.

Meghan upset Kate after she had given birth in 2018 by saying she must have 'baby brain' because of her hormones.

Harry claims Kate admitted she made Meghan cry during a row over bridesmaids dresses before her wedding - and Charlotte burst into tears.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were also jealous of the furnishing William and Kate had in their home and had to make do with shopping at IKEA.

Queen Consort Camilla - 62

Harry doesn't hold back on his dislike for 'the Other Woman' - aka his stepmother Camilla.

Towards the start of the book, Harry explains what life was like after his mother, Princess Diana, died and how his father, King Charles, began to move on.

Harry says he sensed the presence of 'the Other Woman', and that his brother, Prince William, long harboured suspicions about her which confused and tormented him.

After using the phrase four times in half a page, Harry finally reveals that 'the Other Woman' is in fact Queen Consort Camilla.

Harry once pondered if she would become his 'wicked stepmother' and says she would throw people under the bus to sit on the throne - and even turned his bedroom into her dressing room.

He claims he and William begged Charles not to marry Camilla but they said they would welcome her into the family.

Marko - 64

Mark Dyer, known in the book as Marko, was a royal aide and trusted protector of Prince Harry.

Seen by the young prince as a 'second dad', he regularly pops up in stories during Harry's teenage years.

Harry looked up to Marko as a mentor and respected him for being ""an extreme ginger and owning it"".

King Charles tasked the aide with looking after his youngest son - with Marko taking Harry to Botswana when he was a boy.

The royal household sent Marko to give Harry a telling off when he was drug-taking at Eton - and the prince hilariously revealed the story of how he lost his virginity to an older woman in a field to him.

The Queen Mother - 48

Harry's great-grandmother, the Queen Mother, is referred to as Gan-Gan.

The Duke remembers her growing weak and recalls the moment he discovered the Queen Mother had died in March 2002.

He goes into detail about the ""bright and warm"" weather at his school in Eton when he took the dreaded ""phone call"".

But reports from the time say that the prince, who was 17 at the time, wasn't even in the UK and was away skiing in snowy Switzerland with his father and brother.

A statement from the King at the time says he planned to return to the UK as soon as possible - and Harry was photographed returning back a day later.

Prince Philip - 37

Harry's beloved Grandpa is mentioned a lot in the opening chapters - with the book starting on the day of his funeral.

Charles pleaded with William and Harry to stop fighting at Windsor after the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral.

Harry looks back fondly on Prince Philip's 'icy sense of humour' and how he made a joke about his beard amid a family row.

Archie - 26

Prince Harry's son may be lower down on this list than you'd imagine - but most of the book is written about the time before he became a father.

While Meghan was in labour with Archie, Harry devoured a Nando's which had been brought to hospital by his bodyguards.

Harry took laughing gas beside the hospital bed to calm himself - and Meghan found it amusing while bouncing on an exercise ball.

Archie perfected his royal bow when he met the Queen, who was delighted at his attempt

Tiggy - 17

William and Harry's former nanny Alexandra Pettifer, is better known as Tiggy Legge-Bourke.

Tiggy was the boys' favourite nanny and Charles' personal assistant from 1993 to 1999, but Harry does admit that his mother was not a fan.

He believes Diana saw Tiggy as a rival and suspected she was being groomed to be her replacement.

Harry also reveals that Tiggy was one of the loved ones who chastised him for doing the bombshell Oprah Winfrey interview in 2021.

Prince Andrew - 5

Harry's disgraced uncle is only mentioned a handful of times.

In Spare, the Duke of Sussex comments about the Duke of York come when discussing his own security arrangements.

Last year, Andrew paid millions to settle a US civil case brought by his accuser Virginia Giuffre.

The 62-year-old stepped down from public duties following the fallout from his disastrous BBC interview with Emily Maitlis, where he was questioned about his friendship with paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.

He has always denied any allegations and has said he had no recollection of ever meeting Giuffre.

Reported by Daily Mail, Harry writes about his uncle: ""He was embroiled in a shameful scandal, accused of the sexual assault of a young woman, and no one had so much as suggested that he lose his security.

""Whatever grievances people had against us, sex crimes weren't on the list.""

Elsewhere, Harry also says Meghan believed Andrew was the late Queen's personal assistant during their first meeting because he was carrying her handbag.

Lilibet - 3

Lilibet barely gets much of a mention in the book - mainly due to the fact she was born so recently.

There is a dedication to the newest addition to his family, and Harry does go into detail about her birth.

He says that he was the one who delivered the newborn, who was born in June 2021, and he describes how she 'cuddled' people's shins.

Harry is claiming to have a lot more material for a second book, so we can expect to hear a lot more about Lili if that is released.

Spare: by Prince Harry - where to get your hands on a copy

423,"Dust storms are killing hundreds of people and climate change to lead to more deadly storms","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/dust-storms-killing-hundreds-people-29956347","Dust storms are killing hundreds of people and climate change to lead to more deadly storms

Deadly gusts that lift soil and sand up in the air can lead to massive tragedies, such as the one of last week in Illinois. Dust storms were believed to be rare, but scientists say they are becoming increasingly frequent and deadly

Up to 60 vehicles, including tractors piled up on an Illinois highway last Monday due to high spring winds resulting in seven people dying and 40 more getting injured.

The deadly winds stirred up a wall of dust from nearby farm fields, causing a visibility blackout which led to several collisions on a busy stretch of Interstate 55.

The ""horrific"" scene, as described by the state's Governor, J. B. Pritzker, was a rare occurrence in the area, Illinois State Police said at the time.

But across the country, dust storms are occurring more frequently than ever and are claiming hundreds of lives - far more than is currently being reported, scientists claim.

Dust storms are a natural phenomenon that occurs when strong winds lift up dry soil and sand particles into the air, creating a dense cloud that can stretch for miles.

These storms can have a profound impact on the environment and human health, and in recent years, they have become an increasingly common occurrence in certain parts of the US.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the frequency and intensity of dust storms in the region have increased in recent years due to a combination of factors, including drought, climate change, and land-use practices.

If you can't see the poll, click here

The phenomenon can also have a significant impact on transportation and infrastructure.

When a dust storm hits, visibility can be reduced to near zero, making driving and flying extremely hazardous.

A research paper from NOAA's Air Resources Laboratory has found that dust storms are contributing to more traffic fatalities in the US than are currently recorded.

The research found that dust events caused life losses comparable to hurricanes and wildfires in some years, and greater awareness could reduce crashes and save lives.

Specifically, the report found that dust storms caused an estimated 232 deaths between 2007 and 2017, compared to the 10 officially reported.

The report also calls for more consistent reporting methods and proposes modifications to current reporting classifications to more accurately capture the impact of dust storms, which have been previously assumed to be rare and isolated to specific regions.

One of the areas most affected by dust storms is the southwestern United States, particularly the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.

In these regions, dry and arid conditions, combined with strong winds, create the perfect conditions for dust storms to form.

The impact of dust storms on the environment can also be significant, as, when soil and sand are lifted into the air, they can cause damage to crops, vegetation, and wildlife habitats.

In addition, dust particles can contribute to air pollution, leading to respiratory problems and other health issues for people and animals.

The dust particles can also damage buildings, power lines, and other structures, causing disruptions to daily life.

In recent years, there have been several high-profile dust storms in the southwestern United States that have caused significant damage and disruption.

In 2011, a massive dust storm, known as a haboob, swept across the Phoenix metropolitan area, causing power outages and grounding flights.

In 2020, a similar storm hit Lubbock, Texas, causing widespread damage and prompting local officials to declare a state of emergency.

To combat the impact of dust storms, researchers and government agencies are working on several fronts.

Some are focused on improving land-use practices, such as reducing the amount of bare soil and planting vegetation to help stabilize the soil.

Others are exploring new technologies, such as dust suppression systems that can be used to reduce the amount of dust that is lifted into the air.

Despite these efforts, the frequency and intensity of dust storms are likely to continue to increase in the coming years.

What to do during a dust storm

The National Weather Service advises motorists to exercise caution and take appropriate safety measures when driving during a dust storm.

If dense dust is observed approaching or blowing across a roadway, motorists should pull off the pavement as far as possible, stop, turn off lights, set the emergency brake, take their foot off the brake pedal to be sure the tail lights are not illuminated, and wait until visibility improves before proceeding.

If a motorist cannot pull off the roadway, they should proceed at a speed suitable for visibility, turn on lights and sound the horn occasionally, use the painted centre line to help guide them and look for a safe place to pull off the roadway.

It is also advised that motorists should never stop on the travelled portion of the roadway and should ensure that all of their lights are off when parked off the roadway to avoid collisions with other vehicles.

Asda said it is ""experiencing sourcing challenges"" and has imposed three per person limits on certain fruit and vegetables as a result, while Morrisons has introduced a maximum cap of two per person on some items

Lidl, Aldi and Tesco have become the latest supermarket to impose a limit on the number of items customers can buy on certain fruits and vegetables.

It follows similar action from Asda and Morrisons - but why are some foods in short supply?

Shoppers in the UK have noticed a struggle to buy a number of fresh food items over the last few weeks, with shelves left empty in some shops.

Many customers have taken to social media to vent their frustration as a result of the supply issues - while some have questioned the explanation given as they noted other food shops in Europe didn't seem to be having the same issue.

Asda said it is ""experiencing sourcing challenges"" and has imposed three per person limits on certain foods as a result, while Morrisons has introduced a maximum cap of two per person on some items.

Aldi, Tesco and Lidl have now all said they are limiting purchases of some fruits and veg to three per person.

Here is everything you need to know about the current food shortages.

Have you noticed rationing or product limits in stores? Let us know: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk

Why are supermarkets rationing food?

There are several reasons for these industry-wide gaps on shelves.

Firstly, suppliers in Morocco and Spain have had to contend with cold temperatures, heavy rain, and flooding over the past three to four weeks.

These two countries are some of the UK's biggest importers of fruit and vegetables during the winter months.

If you can't see the poll above, click here

The cooler weather this winter in Morocco and Spain has meant tomatoes are taking longer to grow, with tomato volumes from Spain's Almeria region being 22% lower than in February last year.

Morrocan growers and suppliers have also seen ferries cancelled due to the bad weather.

The British Retail Consortium said Britain typically imports 95% of its tomatoes and 90% of lettuces from December to March.

Another reason for the reduced supplies has also been down to rising energy costs for British growers.

British farmers are struggling to power their greenhouses which are used to grow specific crops during the colder months.

Which supermarkets are rationing items?

Five UK supermarkets - Morrisons, Asda, Aldi, Tesco and Lidl - are limiting the number of items customers can buy.

Morrisons is putting limits of two per item and Asda said last Tuesday it was limiting shoppers to three items.

Aldi, Tesco and Lidl are also limiting customers to three items per customer.

An Asda spokesperson said: ""Like other supermarkets, we are experiencing sourcing challenges on some products that are grown in southern Spain and north Africa.

""We have introduced a temporary limit of three of each product on a very small number of fruit and vegetable lines, so customers can pick up the products they are looking for.""

An Aldi spokesperson said: ""We are limiting purchases of peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes to three units per person to ensure that as many customers as possible can buy what they need.""

As of writing, Sainsbury's, Waitrose, M&S and the Co-op have no restrictions in place.

Which products are being rationed?

Peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes are the most common item being rationed right now.

Morrisons and Asda are also imposing limits on lettuce, while Asda has a number of other items affected, including broccoli, cauliflower and raspberries.

Moscow's forces reportedly hit the building in the Ukrainian-held part of Kherson where people fleeing the Dnipro River's rising waters were gathered

Evacuation spots including a school where displaced Ukrainian flood victims were sheltering are said to have been bombed by Russia.

Moscow's forces reportedly shelled the building in the Ukrainian-held part of Kherson where people fleeing the Dnipro River's rising waters were gathered.

It came just after Ukraine 's president Volodymyr Zelensky visited a crossing point where people were being evacuated from flooded areas.

He called for ""a clear and quick global response"" to Tuesday's bombing of the Nova Kakhovka dam, which Kyiv and its allies say the Kremlin orchestrated.

At least five people have died, many are homeless and tens of thousands are without drinking water after the dam was destroyed.

Yevhen Rischuk, the Ukrainian mayor-in-exile of the occupied town of Oleshky, said of the evacuation point attacks: ""[Russian forces] have just fired at [a] school where people from flooded homes were gathering.""

Ukraine's Prosecutor General's Office reported that nine civilians have been wounded in the city of Kherson.

The shelling targeted major evacuation routes from the city, which Ukraine recaptured from Vladimir Putin 's invading forces last autumn. Bogdan Logvynenko, founder of the Ukrainer media project, said: ""They are shelling evacuation spots.""

Ukrainian journalist Kristina Berdynskykh said she fled as Russian bombs rained down near an evacuation point.

She added: ""So many boats, so many volunteers, medics, rescuers working when the shelling began.

""I don't know how far it was from us. We started running for shelter. We hid in a building and waited as shelling continued.""

As shells landed in floodwaters, rescue workers temporarily suspended efforts to retrieve stranded residents and pets in an area Mr Zelensky had visited hours earlier.

Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs said: ""The strikes began during evacuation of residents whose houses were flooded.

""Russia has abandoned people in calamity in the occupied part of the Kherson region.

""It continues to prevent Ukraine from saving lives."" The dam lay along the Dnipro River, which forms part of the front line between Russian and Ukrainian forces.

Russia controlled the dam, and blames Ukraine for it being destroyed. The ensuing floods have ruined crops, displaced land mines, wrought widespread environmental damage and set the stage for long-term electricity shortages. In recent weeks, Ukraine has intensified shelling of Russian positions, signalling that a long-expected counter-offensive could be under way.

There were further signs yesterday as Ukraine reportedly attacked three points in the Zaporizhzhia region with NATO-supplied Leopard 2 tanks.

According to military reports, Ukrainian forces advanced between 200 yards and half a mile in various areas around the city of Bakhmut in recent days and are now on the offensive.

Amid the fighting, both sides were coping with the fallout from the burst dam. Ukrainian rescue workers have stepped up efforts to get drinking water, medical care and other support to residents.

Five people in the Russian-occupied city of Nova Kakhovka have died, its Kremlin-appointed mayor said yesterday.

Rishi Sunak has called the destruction of the dam an ""appalling act"" affecting hundreds of thousands of people.

People have noticed an increase in ladybugs in their homes and gardens, which is unusual for this time of year, with some even saying the insect has 'invaded' their properties

The UK has been having an unusually warm October. And while it means we've been able to sit out and enjoy the sun, other species are also enjoying the warmth. People have been seeing an increase in ladybirds, with homeowners, in particular, saying their homes are being 'invaded' by the colourful insects.

Earlier this month, on October 7, a woman woke up to find 'thousands' of ladybirds had forced their way into her home in Ickleton, Cambridgeshire, leaving the woman with no choice, she said, but to flee. While the invasion was shocking, it's not out of the ordinary to see more ladybirds during this time of year.

According to NottinghamshireLive, the prolonged warm weather is a factor in the rise in ladybird populations. The insects often flee indoors as soon as it becomes colder in an effort to locate a warm place to hibernate over the winter.

By this time of year, the hibernation phase would typically be over but due to the persistently warm temperatures, ladybirds are still enjoying their extra time to find the right sleeping place for winter. ""They're not here to take over and it's likely that they'll be gone as quickly as they arrived,"" ecologist Dean Wilson from Horticulture.co.uk said. ""I wouldn't expect the 'swarms' to stay for longer than one week at the most.""

The ecologist continued by saying that ladybirds are an essential component of the ecosystem because they help to protect crops by consuming insects that feed on plants. Additionally, he clarified that neither humans nor their cherished pets are in any way endangered by the red and black insects. However, Mr Wilson advised people to leave the bug alone if they discover it inside their home.

Dean suggested that people appreciate the numerous benefits and aesthetic value that these insects bring to backyards across the country. That being said, lemongrass, amphor, and peppermint can be effective in preventing ladybird infestations if you think yours is serious.

This advice comes after two people have claimed they spotted bedbugs on public transport in London and Manchester, as Brits feel concerned about a potential infestation as has happened in France. While ladybirds are safe, bedbugs feed on blood, usually at night. Their bites can result in a number of health impacts including skin rashes, psychological effects, and allergic symptoms.

'I really can't handle it for some reason.'

A man has been praised for walking out on a woman mid-date because her eating habits were ""unbearable"" to watch. The 20-year-old, who struggles to put himself out there, agreed to go on a date with a woman, called Maria, from his friend's study group.

He made reservations at a ""somewhat fancy restaurant"" - and made sure he was dressed to impress, wanting to make a good first impression. While the initial hellos were a bit ""awkward"", he started to feel more comfortable in her company as time went on.

Taking to Reddit, he said: ""I got a new haircut, got some new clothes and was pretty excited. It started off awkward, then we both slowly let loose and became more comfortable. All in all, she seems like a nice girl to talk to.""

But his opinion on his date completely changed as soon as their server brought over their main course. ""Once the main course arrives, it all goes down hill,"" he added. ""I realised she chews with her mouth open. That's been my biggest pet peeve as a kid, I really can't handle it for some reason.""

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.

He went on to explain how his dad would chew with his mouth open, causing him to flee from the dining table to escape the sight and sound of it. With her, it wasn't just chewing with her mouth open. It was also loud smacking noises, she was eating like she hadn't eaten in three weeks, was slurping her food and making aggressive 'nom nom' sounds.

""I don't have any issues with a girl chowing down her food. I acknowledge that there is some sort of weird ick if a girl eats a lot or something. That wasn't it at all. I can eat a lot in one sitting, and I'm not going to judge anyone else for doing so. But, I had a problem with her absolute lack of manners. It was brutish.

""I politely asked her to chew with her mouth closed, and that she was making a lot of noise. She looked upset, but apologised. I told her it was fine, but that it was just a pet peeve of mind and I find it hard to ignore, and apologised back.

""Not 30 seconds later, she starts doing the same thing. I looked up at her, and told her 'you're doing it again', but she got more upset this time and told me to mind my own business, and let her enjoy her food."" With that, he got up from the table, paid for his share of the meal and left the restaurant.

""The day after, the friend who set me up blew up my phone saying that I was a horrible person, and how Maria was crying all night because of me. I told her what happened, but she started yelling so I just cut the call. Maria also naturally blocked me on Instagram.

""I still stand firm with my actions though. Perhaps I did a bit much by leaving so soon, but I also expect a date to have some sort of etiquette."" Wanting to know whether he was too harsh on his date, he has taken to social media to ask users for their thoughts.

In response, one user said: ""I once went on a blind date where she chewed with her mouth open. While I didn't bolt mid-date, there was no second date."" Another user added: ""Your date was eating with less manners than barn yard livestock. I don't blame you. People are going to see/hear that and look poorly at both of you.""

A third user said: ""I broke up with an otherwise lovely guy for exactly this reason. He liked to take me out to nice restaurants, but I could never enjoy them due to his horrible table manners. He told me he'd done it since he was a kid and that his grandma used to make him eat in the other room because he could or would not learn not to do it. It was a deal-breaker.""

On the final day of Parliament before recess - dubbed ""˜Take Out the Trash Day' - the Government rushed out a flurry of announcements. Here's what you might have missed...

Rishi Sunak will be breathing a sigh of relief today after MPs quit Parliament for the half-term recess and returned to their constituencies.

Bitter Tory divisions have burst into the open again this week after the ex-PM Boris Johnson was referred to the police over further allegations of lockdown-busting gatherings.

The Prime Minister also clung onto his Home Secretary Suella Braverman - despite facing demands to launch an investigation into whether she had broken the ministerial code.

And there was a major row between the official Covid inquiry chairwoman and the Cabinet Office over access to unredacted WhatsApp messages from Mr Johnson.

Amid the chaos, the Government dumped a huge batch of written statements, documents and announcements on the final day before the parliamentary recess.

The Mirror has trawled through the news that slipped out on the last day before recess. They wouldn't want you to miss anything would they?

Animal welfare bill ditched

Rishi Sunak was accused of an ""astonishing betrayal"" after scrapping a flagship animal welfare bill first unveiled by Boris Johnson.

The Conservatives' 2019 election manifesto promised to introduce new laws on animal welfare, including banning exports of livestock for slaughter and tackling puppy smuggling.

The Kept Animals Bill cleared its first parliamentary hurdle in 2021 - but has failed to progress since as ministers stalled on the legislation.

In an statement on Thursday, Environment Minister Mark Spencer, announced the Bill had been ditched.

Bizarrely, however, he insisted the key measures proposed in the legislation will still be brought forward ""individually"" before the next general election - expected in 2024.

The move led to outrage from animal welfare groups, including the RSPCA.

Asylum backlog hits new record

During the summer Tory leadership campaign Rishi Sunak pledged to ""bust"" the asylum backlog - but new figures yesterday showed it hit a record high.

Home Office statistics published on Thursday revealed the number waiting for an initial decision rose from 166,261 to 172,758.

No10 was also forced to slap down Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick after he told MPs speeding up asylum decisions could act as a pull factor for those seeking refuge.

Mr Jenrick told the Commons it was ""not correct"" that processing illegal migrants' claims faster would reduce arrivals and ""in all likelihood it'll lead to an increase"".

But the PM's spokesman said: ""What we are focusing on is reducing the numbers, tackling that backlog is the right approach.""

Legal aid changes spark inflation warning

Reforms to the legal aid system will mean an additional six million vulnerable people are eligible for assistance in criminal and civil cases.

But experts warned that the eligibility criteria had not been updated in line with inflation.

""Widening eligibility for civil and criminal legal aid is an important step in the right direction and something we have long been pushing for,"" said Law Society President Lubna Shuja.

""Increased eligibility is long overdue, but if thresholds are not regularly increased with inflation the cost-of-living crisis will mean more and more people are going to fall back through the justice gap.""

40 new hospitals pledge in doubt

The Tories have admitted that eight new hospitals promised by Boris Johnson will be delayed after a decision was taken to prioritise crumbling buildings.

Health Secretary Steve Barclay admitted that some of the original facilities will not be completed by the end of the decade as focus is shifting to five hospitals deemed ""not safe to operate beyond 2030"".

The addition of these hospitals and three new mental health facilities to the list means ""not all work will be completed by 2030"" on all the sites in Boris Johnson's manifesto pledge, Mr Barclay said.

He claimed the shake-up ""meets our manifesto commitment to build 40 hospitals by 2030"" - but with a different list of hospitals.

The flagship manifesto vow has already come under fire after it emerged that some of the schemes were refurbishments or simply additions of extra units.

One in ten childcare providers think they'll close

A report on childcare found many providers expect they will have to close because of rising costs.

The government conducted a survey of 1,857 providers, including childminders and school-based services. Just 2% said they planned to close in the next six months.

But one in 10 said it was ""likely"" would have to close.

Commissioners sent into debt-ridden council

The Government has ordered commissioners to effectively run Woking Borough Council which is mired in debt.

In a written statement, Local Government Minister Lee Rowley said it was the ""most indebted council in England"" with debt forecast to hit an eye-watering £2.4billion in 2024/25.

The Surrey council, which had been Conservative-led, got into hot water after a spending spree on commercial property.

Lib Dem leader Ann-Marie Baker, whose party took control last year, said: ""My administration is very clear about the huge challenges facing the council due to the legacy of both the extraordinarily high and disproportionate levels of debt that we have inherited from the previous administration.

""We are also very clear and focused on the significant risks that the council is now facing up to as a result of that debt.

""We also recognise that these challenges are so significant that the council and its officers cannot deal with these on its own.""

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has caused two reported deaths in Pakistan and there have been several cases reported in Spain, in addition to other nations

Neck pain is one of nine early symptoms of a killer virus spreading Europe.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), which has caused deaths in Iraq, Pakistan, Namibia and other countries, could reach the UK, experts have warned.

James Wood, head of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University, said CCHF is one of the biggest threats to public health at the moment.

The disease is caused by Nairovirus, a condition that is spread by ticks and according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and has a fatality rate of between 10 and 40 percent.

Early symptoms include neck pain and stiffness, and fever, but medics stress these are also common signs of less serious diseases and illnesses too. CCHF can be treated at the onset with antiviral drugs, such as ribavirin.

Nine symptoms of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever

Myalgia (muscle ache)

Dizziness

Neck pain and stiffness

Backache

Headache

Sore eyes

Photophobia (sensitivity to light)

Nausea

Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) website says: ""It is difficult to prevent or control CCHF infection in animals and ticks as the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in domestic animals is usually not apparent.

""Furthermore, the tick vectors are numerous and widespread, so tick control with acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) is only a realistic option for well-managed livestock production facilities.""

It also states preventative measures should be used to avoid human-to-human transmission, including avoiding close physical contact with CCHF-infected people, wearing gloves and protective equipment when taking care of ill people and washing hands regularly after caring for or visiting ill people.

""WHO is working with partners to support CCHF surveillance, diagnostic capacity and outbreak response activities in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa,"" the website adds.

""WHO also provides documentation to help disease investigation and control, and has created an aide-memoire on standard precautions in health care, which is intended to reduce the risk of transmission of bloodborne and other pathogens.""

Infamous Stott Hall Farm is located directly between junctions 22 and 23 on the M62, on a rather peculiar patch of land. But what is life really like for the family there?

Their house is surrounded by speeding cars and lorries, lots of noise and plenty of wind, but farmers Paul Thorp and Jill Falkingham-Thorp wouldn't have it any other way.

The married couple, who proudly live on an 18th-century farmhouse sandwiched between two busy motorway lanes, lead a life that's different from most people's.

Every day, they wake up to more than 100,000 motorists crossing the M62, which runs on either side of their family home - that's slap bang in the middle of junctions 22 and 23.

Though, it hasn't stopped Paul and Jill, and their six-year-old son, John-William, looking after hundreds of ewes and cows on the moorland beside the split roads.

Its history has long fascinated the nation, and people used to believe that the previous owner, Ken Wild, refused to budge when the road was built in the sixties.

So, the six lanes of traffic grew around him instead, and created the peculiar piece of land that drivers thunder past today.

Though, this myth was busted by Ken and his family in an ITV documentary, when they revealed the M62 had to be built around the farm because of a geological fault beneath.

The space forced the lanes of the motorway apart, and re-joined them further down, leaving a secluded and long patch of land for the farm to live on.

After Ken passed away, worker Paul moved in during 2008, and welcomed wife Jill one year later, to work together as sheep farmers on Stott Hall Farm.

Speaking previously about her first experience at the home, Jill admitted that it was a shock to the system and ""seriously dated"", but has since been transformed.

""When I first came, the house was horrendous. It was dated and there was no bathroom upstairs. We had to rip all the flags up as everything was damp,"" she told Yorkshire Live.

""I remember how cold the house was and there being a hole in one of the walls where you could see outside.""

According to Jill, living next to one of Britain's busiest motorways isn't much different to living near to any other road.

""Traffic is very close,"" she said. ""But it's always windy here, which takes the pollution away. Students from the University of Huddersfield took soil and air samples and actually pollution is surprisingly low.

""The noise does affect me as I am quite noise sensitive. Paul is fine with it but it does grate on me.

""It's the sort of thing that if you are having a bad day, the noise is the last straw. But it's not going away.""

Jill added: ""A lot of people say it's bleak and like Wuthering Heights but I don't see it like that. I think it's beautiful.""

The couple explained that the motorway is the least of their challenges, as working on an upland hill farm is incredibly hard work and cold.

Last year, Paul appeared on Channel 4's show 'The Pennines: Backbone of Britain' to give an incredibly insight into life on the farm.

""I came here as a 22-year-old lad who was mad about farming,"" Paul told the documentary.

""To get an opportunity to take on a farm this size were once in a lifetime, so it's my home now. It's just everything.""

He added: ""It's just like any other farm really. You've got to know your land, know your job and plan around it.

""The only thing is we've got six lanes of traffic through ours. It throws up its challenges, it's very unique.""

Referring to the traffic, he said: ""The mind boggles as to where everybody is going. I just cannot get me head around where everybody's going every day.""

The farmer is seen tackling a vital problem - how to ensure any of their four-legged friends never collide with four-wheeled vehicles.

If they do jump over the fence, Highways England staff have to call the couple and the motorway is shut until they recover their livestock.

On the show, Paul needs the help of dry stone wallers to help resolve this modern problem.

Paul explained: ""As my grandad said, the stone in Yorkshire were put underneath Yorkshire so it could be used on top of Yorkshire.

""There's nowt else that would last, if you put a concrete wall up here, it would just erode in no time.""

431,"Hajj essentials as record-breaking numbers expected in Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/hajj-essentials-record-breaking-numbers-30323148","Hajj essentials as record-breaking numbers expected in Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage

Around two million people will take part in the five-day experience in Saudi Arabia which brings Muslims closer to God and to the entire Muslim world

A record-breaking number of Muslims officially began the annual Hajj pilgrimage on Monday in Saudi Arabia and these are the essentials needed for the trek.

Straw hats, cross-body bags, and collapsible chairs are just some of the essentials people bring to the Hajj pilgrimage, which will see full capacity this year for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic three years ago.

Around two million people will take part in the five-day experience which brings Muslims closer to God and to the entire Muslim world.

Pilgrims will walk outdoors for hours around holy sites in Mecca and the surrounding desert. People will make their way out of Mecca after circling Islam's holiest site, the Kaaba, and then converge on a vast tent camp in the nearby desert for a day and night of prayer.

Umaima Hafez, from Egypt, has done the pilgrimage five times and tells Associated Press how to pack like a pro.

Sitting on her portable plastic stool, she reaches into her large pack and pulls out a blanket, homemade granola and crackers, a travel towel that she wets and places on her head when it gets hot, an extra-thick prayer mat - for her knees - and some medications.

""Everything is beautiful and easy with God. - And people give out a lot of water and food here"", she says everything is easier with God on the journey.

Hassan Hussain, a 24-year-old first-time pilgrim from the UK, also packed lots of essentials and his bag is rammed with his phone, charging cable, power bank, sunglasses, water bottle, British and Saudi currency, bank cards, shoe bag, a prayer mat and hydrating facial mist.

He said his sister, who did the Hajj last year, told him what to bring. His advice to other pilgrims is to overpack.

""You don't know when you're going to need things,"" he said. ""The person next to you might need things. Just take everything and work it out as you go along.""



Ali Ibn Mousa, a 30-year-old Russian and father of seven, goes for the lighter-packing method, with just a small drawstring bag that holds his phone and his pilgrim ID.

He said: ""If I had a heavy bag, I wouldn't be able to do some of the things I want to. That's why I take a small bag that is easy to carry, so I can run inside.""

Pilgrims begin by entering a state of spiritual purity known as ""ihram.""

Men wear simple, white terrycloth garments and women forgo make-up and cover their hair. The pilgrims circle the black, cube-shaped Kaaba seven times and walk between two hills, all of which are encompassed by Mecca's Grand Mosque, the world's largest.

The rituals during Hajj largely commemorate the Quran's accounts of Ibrahim, his son Ismail and Ismail's mother Hajar. The walk between the hills, for example, recreates Hajar's search for water in the desert for Ismail.

In Islamic tradition, Ibrahim was ordered by God to sacrifice his son, Ismail, only to have his hand stayed at the last moment. Muslims believe Ibrahim and Ismail later built the Kaaba, which Muslims face during their daily prayers no matter where they are in the world.

In the Christian and Jewish traditions, which refer to him as Abraham, the biblical patriarch is ordered to sacrifice his other son, Isaac.

The giant flows of pilgrims move back and forth between holy sites spread out over a length of more than 10 miles from the Grand Mosque to Mount Arafat, out in the desert.

Even within a single ritual site, it can take much of the day to walk from one end to another, like Mina, where pilgrims will stay in one of the world's largest tent camps and stone the pillars representing the devil.

Pilgrims have been doing the ritual circuit around the Kaaba since arriving in Mecca in recent days.

As the last ones performed it Monday, the pilgrims made their way by foot or by bus to Mina, where they will camp in one of the largest tent cities in the world.

They will pray throughout the day and night before travelling on Tuesday to Mount Arafat, where the Prophet Muhammad is said to have delivered his final sermon.

The pilgrims will then collect pebbles from a site known as Muzdalifa to be used in the symbolic stoning of pillars representing the devil back in Mina. The final three days of the Hajj coincide with the festive Eid al-Adha holiday when Muslims around the world slaughter livestock and distribute the meat to the poor.

Different countries around the world have different laws when it comes to what you can and can't bring into the nation, with some banning yellow clothes and others haggis

Brits could face a hefty fine when they arrive on their holidays if they don't leave the flip flops and chewing gum at home.

While you may think your biggest chance of landing in hot water when on holiday is by breaching Magaluf's new anti-lout rules there are other, less obvious laws which could cause you some bother on holiday.

You'll want to double-check your luggage before jetting abroad in case you've accidentally packed an item that is blacklisted. While everyone knows not to slip a weapon or explosives into your luggage, some entrants on the banned list are less obvious.

For example in Singapore it has been against the law to import and sell chewing gum since 1992, when the legislation was passed in an attempt to help improve the cleanliness of the island. At first many locals were outraged, heading to neighbouring Malaysia to get their packets despite the government's promise to name and shame those caught.

The law proved a big success in terms of cleanliness, but the threat of a S$10,000 (£6,000) fine for those caught importing it remains. It should be noted that first-time travellers are usually given a pass if they accidentally bring in a pack.

Christopher Nye, senior content editor at overseas property experts YourOverseasHome, said: ""Before travelling or moving to a new country, it's always a good idea to get to grips with their culture and customs - and that includes any weird and wonderful laws that are enforced. Staying on the right side of these laws is imperative not only to keep the peace, but failure to do so could land you a hefty fine, deportation, or even imprisonment in some cases!""

Below we've listed some of the most unusual items which are banned in various countries

Flip flops - Capri

You can wear flip flops around the majority of Italy, but you're not allowed to take them to the island of Capri. Here, it's illegal to wear 'excessively noisy' footwear - including flip flops - as locals value their 'peace and quiet', and the rhythmical thwack of rubber on stone is considered too annoying.

Baby walkers - Canada

Baby walkers have been banned in Canada since 2004. Why? It seems that babies are great at using them, just not always so good at steering them in a safe direction, which can cause the typically sanguine Canadians to become irate.

Chewing gum - Singapore

It's not illegal to chew gum in Singapore, but it is against the law to import it and sell it, and has been since 1992. Exceptions exist for dental and nicotine gum, but you can only purchase these from a doctor or registered pharmacist. Definitely don't get caught chucking a bit on the ground, as leniency is unlikely to be applied.

Haggis - USA

It's a bit of a shame for Burns fans, but in 1971 it became illegal to import authentic haggis into the US due to a ban on food containing sheep lung, which constitutes 10-15% of the traditional Scottish recipe. As per the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 1971 ruling, ""Livestock lungs shall not be saved for use as human food"". It may surprise some that a country that famously washes its chickens in chlorine draws the line at haggis.

Jasmine flowers - China

In May 2011, it was reported that Beijing police had banned the sale of jasmine flowers at various markets, which was causing wholesale prices to collapse. Both the flower and plant cannot be sold, purchased, worn, or talked about in China since anonymous calls for a Chinese ""jasmine revolution"" began circulating on the internet.

Kinder Eggs - USA

Kinder Surprise eggs are banned in the US, and it's illegal to import them too. This is because of a law that dictates that any food with a 'non-nutritive object embedded' is not allowed - including toys inside confectionery items. Though you can't get them in the States, you can still find them in neighbouring countries Canada and Mexico, if you are in real need of a chocolate egg treat.

Sudafed - Japan

Due to Japan's strict anti-stimulant drug laws, any narcotics containing pseudoephedrine - like Sudafed and Vicks inhalers - are banned. Medicines containing codeine are also banned in Japan, and foreign nationals have even been detained and deported for offences.

Yellow clothing - Malaysia

In 2016, the Malaysian government banned yellow clothing after thousands of protestors wearing yellow t-shirts flooded the streets of Kuala Lumpur and demanded the resignation of the Prime Minister. Since then, anyone wearing yellow can be arrested, under the assumption that they're also protesting, rather than having just slipped something cheerful on.

Vapes and electronic cigarettes - Thailand

Vape fans should similarly leave their e-cigarettes in the UK, as Thailand has had a ban on the import, export, sale and possession of vaping products since November 2014. ""The mods, juices and disposable vapes are categorically prohibited. There is no excuse. Even proving that you brought the vape for personal use isn't acceptable to authorities,"" the World Vapers Alliance has said, a lobbying body was alleged links to the tobacco industry.

Although importing vapes into Thailand is banned, in recent years the prohibition on sales in the country has been scrapped.

Camouflage print - the Caribbean

Some countries such as Barbados, Aruba and other Caribbean nations have laws prohibiting camouflage clothing from being worn by non-military personnel, including tourists. Having it in your luggage or as the pattern on bags or backpacks also falls within the ban's limits.

Wildfires on the Greek resort island of Rhodes forced more evacuations as strong winds and successive heat waves that left scrubland and forests tinder-dry fuelled three major fires raging elsewhere in Greece

Chilling satellite images show the horrifying devastation wreaked by wildfires on the Greek island of Rhodes.

Greece is using an EU satellite service to estimate the damage caused by the fire and to target resources.

Photographs published online by the service showed a brown hourglass-shaped burn scar across the middle of the island.

A week-old wildfire on the Greek resort island of Rhodes tore past defences Monday, forcing more evacuations as strong winds and successive heat waves that left scrubland and forests tinder-dry fueled three major fires raging elsewhere in Greece.

The latest evacuations were ordered in south Rhodes after 19,000 people, mostly tourists, were moved in buses and boats over the weekend out of the path of the fire that reached several coastal areas from nearby mountains. It was the country's biggest evacuation effort in recent years.

Follow live updates on the wildfires in Greece here and contact The Mirror with your stories on webnews@mirror.co.uk

""We are at war - completely focused on the fires,"" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said during a debate in parliament. ""Over the coming days and weeks, we must remain on constant alert.""

Help continued to arrive from the European Union and elsewhere, with firefighting planes from neighbouring Turkey joining the effort on Rhodes, where 10 water-dropping planes and 10 helicopters buzzed over flames up to 5 meters (16 feet) tall despite low visibility.

Temperatures reached the low 40s Celsius (above 104 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the Greek mainland Monday, a day after soaring as high as 45 degrees (113 degrees Fahrenheit).

Evacuations were also ordered overnight on the western island of Corfu, where more than 2,000 people were moved to safety by land and sea, as well as on the island of Evia and in a mountainous area in the southern Peloponnese region.

In Greece, an average of 50 new wildfires have broken out daily for the past 12 days, according to government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis. On Sunday, 64 new blazes were recorded.

The Rhodes fire roared down mountain slopes, burning homes and cars and leaving livestock dead on the roadside as they tried to escape.

Authorities said no serious injuries were reported, but hospitals and health volunteers provided first aid to tourists and others, mostly for the effects of heat and dehydration.

European heatwave

Why is it so hot in Europe at the moment?

Heatwaves are defined as uncharacteristically hot periods which last for three days or more. The Cerberus heatwave - named after a three-headed dog that guards the entrance to hell in Dante Allighieri's Inferno - brought temperatures approaching 40C.

The Charon heatwave - named after Greek mythology's ferryman for the dead - comes as almost half of Europe is placed under an amber drought warning. Charon won't reach the UK though, as the inferno is set to slowly shift southeast over the coming week.

What is causing the heatwave?

Cerberus is being driven by the combination of a high-pressure system sitting above the Mediterranean and unseasonably high sea surface temperatures. This means that, as air descends, light winds are created, whilst rising evaporation creates humidity. The hottest summers are now 30 times more likely to occur than before the Industrial Revolution, according to the Met Office, due to climate change.

The Charon anticyclone is thought to have been created by a southern shift of the jet stream - a ribbon of winds high up in the atmosphere that drives weather systems. This develops a high-pressure region across southern Europe and northern Africa, which may last for weeks.

What are the dangers of heatwaves?

Heatwaves are becoming more regular and intense in Europe, due to the climate crisis. Last summer's heat waves contributed to an estimated 61,000 deaths in Europe, compared to the 72,000 deaths recorded across the continent during the devastating 2003 European heat wave. Young children, those with serious health conditions, and the elderly are at a higher risk of heat-related illness.

If you are travelling to Europe, follow Foreign Office advice and speak to your travel operator before travelling, as you may not be offered a refund. As an extreme heat event seems set to hit the UK over the next few weeks, it is vital to stay hydrated and avoid caffeine and alcohol. It is also important to know the symptoms of heatstroke, which include: nausea, weakness, cramps, heat rash and tiredness.

Extreme temperatures can also trigger natural disasters such as the wildfires engulfing the Greek island of Rhodes, which has seen 19,000 people evacuated.

Reporting by Eleanor Luxton

Due to the fires in Greece, several airlines, including easyJet and package operator Tui, sent planes to Rhodes to evacuate tourists forced out of hotels.

The UK government said between 7,000 and 10,000 British nationals are on the island, a popular package holiday destination.

Some tourists said travel companies had failed to provide information or help. Officials from the Greek Foreign Ministry were working at the international airport with several embassies and diplomats who traveled from the UK to assist tourists who had lost their travel documents.

Rhodes is one of Greece's most popular holiday destinations, visited by about 2.5 million tourists each year.

As some visitors continued to flee the island Monday, others were arriving from multiple European destinations to start their holidays at resorts not affected by the wildfire - some 90% of the total according to Greek authorities.

Brits venturing into Europe are being warned about Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) which is spread through ticks after a 27-year-old patient died from the disease

British holidaymakers venturing into Europe this month are being warned after a woman died of an eye-bleeding disease.

The patient, aged 27, contracted Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in North Macadonia, which is spread by ticks. It kills up to 40% of those infected, according to the World Health Organisation. Authorities have worked to track down 67 of the victim's contacts already, with CCHF able to pass between humans via blood or bodily fluids.

It is suspected the unnamed woman caught the infection after being bitten on July 19 while visiting Å tip in the country's eastern regions. The Institute of Public Health of the Republic of North Macedonia said she was hospitalised four days later.

She had developed flu-like symptoms which then escalated. CCHF symptoms include fever, muscle aches, dizziness, light sensitivity and sickness. This can lead to organ failure and internal bleeding. The woman died on July 27. The disease was first identified in Crimea in 1944 and is now endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and some Asia nations.

Experts believe it could be spreading outside its usual territories and getting closer to the UK as a result of climate change. Seven cases have been reported in Spain, including three deaths, since 2016.

As of May, CCFC has been identified by the WHO as one of nine ""priority diseases"" in terms of its threat to the public. Scientists at a Science, Innovation and Technology Committee meeting last month said it is ""highly likely"" it could reach Britain in the near future.

During the hearing, James Wood, head of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University, said CCHF could find its way to the UK ""through our ticks, at some point"".

Symptoms of CCHF

Among the virus' symptoms include headaches , high fever, back and joint pain, stomach ache, and vomiting. Red eyes, a flushed face, a red throat, and petechiae (red spots) on the palate are also common.

In severe cases, WHO warns, jaundice, mood swings and sensory perception are encountered. As the illness progresses, large areas of severe bruising, severe nosebleeds, and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites can be seen, beginning on about the fourth day of illness and lasting for about two weeks.

In documented outbreaks of CCHF, fatality rates in hospitalised patients ranged from nine percent to as high as 50 percent. The long-term effects of CCHF infection have not been studied well enough in survivors to determine whether or not specific complications exist. However, recovery is slow.

How is it spread?

According to the WHO, human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from ""close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons"".

Concerningly, there is currently no vaccine available for either people or animals infected by the disease. CCHF is transmitted to people by either bites from ticks or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues immediately after slaughter.

Hosts of CCHF include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep and goats. According to the WHO, the majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.

Reported deaths

Iraq was reportedly in a major battle with the disease last year, with 212 incidents recorded between January 1 and May 22. Of those, 169 were reported between April and May alone. Agence France-Presse added in May that almost 100 additional cases - and 13 deaths - were so far in 2023 attributed to the toll in Iraq.

A woman has won her share of a fortune after complaining she was written out of her dad's will due to 'sexism'. Julie Mate' 62' watched as her brothers in West Yorkshire made huge profits off the land their father left them

A woman has won a share of £9million fortune after her dad favoured her brothers in his will.

Farmer's daughter Julie Mate, 62, went up against brother Andrew and Robert Mate in court when the pair were given the whole of their parent's West Yorkshire dairy farm.

She has now received a £652,000 payout from her brothers' fortune after the land that was left to them went from £300,000 to £9 million.

Julie was told by Robert ""you're not coming back"" after she left the home to go to university.

Growing up, she helped to run the farm, even sacrificing her school and social life to help out. She called the the farm work as a child ""forced labour"" in a letter to her mum in 2014.

Julie was left devastated and dumbfounded"" when her dad Donald Mate died in 1992 and left his share of the farm to his wife Shirley and sons, with Shirley, now 89, later also giving her share to the boys.

She believes she and her two sisters being left out of the farm fortune - they left £12,000 each - was down to sexism where the women in the family were left ""nowt.""

In a letter to her sister Virginia, Julie complained about a ""male-dominated farming tradition.""

She wrote: ""To be extremely blunt, given the value of the farm - when dad died, but particularly now - we three have been extremely badly done to.

""You can call it the outcome of a male-dominated farming tradition, bloody mindedness, or simply male chauvinism - whatever it was, and with no disrespect to dad, it really doesn't wash nowadays.""

Donald and Shirley Mate had been partners in a milk bottling and retail business, run from Fold Farm in Netherton, near Huddersfield, the court heard.

Julie worked to get the land removed from the Green Belt so that it could be built on. This dramatically increased the value of the land but Julie did not get a major share of the rewards.

The farm was struggling at the beginning of the 2000s and Julie began to look at ways it could make money.

She said she was encouraged by her mum from 2007 and looked at the potential for the development of 40 acres of farmland.

Julie said she worked on the project between 2008 and 2015 with a planning consultant and was under the impression that, if it was profitable, she would see an equal share of the rewards.

The local council approved it for housing in 2012, and Julie called Andrew to update him.

She told him she had done the work ""on behalf of the girls,"" to which Andrew is said to have asked angrily: ""What's it got to do with you?""

""She described it as 'his typical rant,' which she understood to mean 'push off, you silly woman',"" Judge Andrew Sutcliffe KC said.

The judge added the brothers had been ""unjustly enriched"" as a result.

Julie said the brothers made it clear to her that she should not return to the business after university, even though she wanted to.

She said she has not always had the best relationship with her brothers Robert, now 65, and Andrew, 60, and recalled an incident when a 17-year-old Andrew had driven a Land Rover at her in the farmyard.

Julie also claimed Robert once put his hand around her throat and told her ""you're not coming back.""

Both brothers deny the incidents occurred.

""Although Robert and Andrew denied or did not recall these incidents, I accept that they occurred,"" said the judge in his ruling on the case.

""I also accept that from at least this time, and probably before then, the relationship between Julie and her brothers was strained, caused in part by the interest which Julie had shown in the farm and the brothers' determination that she should not be involved.""

The judge added he thought the original will gave the daughters only ""token recognition"" for their work.

""In her view, it meant the sisters were subsidising their brothers so that they could have a life on the family farm, which was something she was not given the opportunity to pursue,"" he continued.

The land Julie had worked to get valued was included in the council's Local Plan in 2015, but her mum and brothers agreed a £9million sale to developers Persimmon Homes without telling her.

In response, she executed a deed of trust, giving her son's beneficial interest in the land and then brought forward a High Court appeal in 2020.

Mum Shirley did not contest.

The judge added: ""I accept Julie's evidence that at no time did she tell either of her brothers or Shirley that she would work on this project for nothing, without expectation of any reward.""

He continued: ""Shirley, Andrew and Robert obtained the benefit of Julie's services, at Julie's expense, in circumstances where they had notice of the services, they knew that Julie expected a reward for her services, and they could have rejected the benefit, but did not.""

Julie, who studied animal science at university, worked as an agricultural journalist and then as a senior executive in dairy companies and farming organisations.

She now lives in North Shropshire with her partner Tom Biggins.

A massive 96% of people in a Department for Environment survey were against killing animals for their coats, which further shows the support for The Mirror's Fur Free Britain campaign

Our campaign to curb the barbaric fur trade has won overwhelming support.

A massive 96% of people in a Department for Environment survey were against killing animals for their coats. Nearly 30,000 took part. Yet despite repeated Mirror requests, the Government sat on the results.

But now a Freedom of Information request has revealed a letter about the poll from ex-Environment Secretary George Eustice to Scottish counterpart Mairi Gougeon, Scotland 's Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs.

His letter in December 2021 confirmed this result of the Call for Evidence and stated: ""This received over 29,000 responses, of which over 96% strongly agreed that it is wrong for animals to be killed for the sake of their fur. The Government will therefore take forward a ban on the import and sale of fur.""

""ŒThe correspondence also reveals that a fur import ban has the backing of the Scottish Government. In February 2022, Mairi Gougeon confirmed in a reply that ""The Scottish Ministers support, in principle, the initiative to prohibit the import and sale in Great Britain of fur to address the public moral objection to any rearing or killing of animals purely for their fur"".

The Mirror launched the Fur Free Britain campaign with HSI/UK in 2021 and calls for a UK fur import and sales ban. It has gathered over 1.1 million petition signatures to date.""Œ Despite banning fur farming in 2003 on animal welfare grounds, the UK still imports and sells fur from other countries including Finland and China. HMRC records show that in 2022, the UK imported £41,970,308 of fur, which HSI/UK estimates to be equivalent to over one million animals.

Claire Bass, senior director of campaigns and public affairs at Humane Society International/UK, said: ""The Government ran a Call for Evidence on the UK fur trade in May 2021 and has been inexplicably sitting on the results ever since. Today it transpires that the evidence obtained is a slam-dunk in support of a ban, with 96% of respondents agreeing that it is wrong to kill animals for their fur. Based on this evidence the Government confirmed it would take forward a ban, and the Scottish Government confirmed its backing for one, and then - nothing.

""Nearly 30,000 people and organisations took the time to provide evidence, but over the last year Ministers haven't shown willing to let evidence lead progress on this policy. We urge the new Defra Secretary to release the results and then move forward with a ban. Fur is not only appalling for animals, top British virologists have warned that fur farms are a ticking time bomb for pandemic disease risk. The UK should have no part in this cruel, unnecessary and dangerous trade.""

""ŒA Defra spokesperson said: ""Fur farming has been banned in the UK for over 20 years. The UK has some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world and as set out in our Action Plan for Animal Welfare, we are committed to building a clear evidence base to inform future decisions on these issues. We are currently gathering information and speaking to a range of interested parties to help us do this.""

The 2003 NBA Draft saw LeBron James enter the league alongside Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh and Dwayne Wade - but the other top-five pick did not hit the same heights as that quartet

One-time NBA champion Darko Milicic went from playing for the Boston Celtics to working on a farm within five years.

Milicic, 38, was the No. 2 overall pick by the Detroit Pistons in the stacked 2003 NBA Draft. Only LeBron James was selected higher than the seven-footer from Serbia.

Immediately after the teenager went off the board, the three players picked were Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh and Dwayne Wade. While four of the top five are either already inducted or future Hall of Famers, Milicic is the massive expectation.

When Bosh and James joined Wade on the Miami Heat in the summer of 2010, the Serbian center was signing what would turn out to be his penultimate NBA contract. After seven seasons, Milicic had twice been traded and had already played for five teams.

Despite their differing careers, the No. 2 pick was the first to get a ring out of the top-five picks in that draft class. After playing sporadically on a strong Pistons as a rookie, Milicic made history in the NBA Finals by becoming the youngest player to feature in the championship series.

That record the 18-year-old set still stands to this day, as does being the youngest champion in league history. Milicic remains the youngest foreign player to take to the court and the fifth youngest overall.

Those championship-winning days in Detroit during that debut season remain the pinnacle of a career full of unfulfilled potential. After two more years of barely playing, the Pistons traded Milicic to the Orlando Magic.

Short stints on the Memphis Grizzlies, New York Knicks, Minnesota Timberwolves and Celtics followed. After making a single appearance in Boston, Milicic retired at the end of the 2012/13 season.

A professional kickboxing career followed in 2014 after returning to Serbia. However, it was not long before Milicic tried to restart playing basketball back home.

The center was to play for Metalac Farmakom in 2015, an established club still competing in the top-tier Basketball League of Serbia. But, after announcing that intention, the player made a U-turn. That was when the move into farming took place.

As revealed in a 2017 interview with ESPN, Milicic became the owner of around 125 acres of apple orchard and exported fruit around the world. At the time, the plans were to purchase more land and get into growing cherries.

The former player-turned-picker spoke about the pride felt from the new line of work. ""I was just really happy,"" Milicic said. ""You know, we were picking our apples. Ours.""

Despite finding a passion in agriculture, a return to basketball at an amateur level did follow in 2019, playing for Novi Sad-based I Came to Play alongside other recently retired players. That stint did not last long, though, and Milicic finally left the sport behind in 2020 after an on-off two decades love affair with the game.

Ludvig Aberg was chasing down his first PGA Tour win at the Sanderson Farms Championship but lost in a five-way playoff following the heroics from rival Luke List

European Ryder Cup star Ludvig Aberg was denied his first PGA Tour win in dramatic fashion, after Luke List prevailed at the Sanderson Farms Championship.

Aberg and List were part of a five-way playoff at the FedEx Cup fall event, alongside Henrik Norlander, Ben Griffin and Scott Stallings. All five players finished at 18-under-par across their four rounds, to ensure a 73rd hole of the week was needed to crown the winner.

On the extra hole, both Norlander and Stallings failed to hit the green in two after leaving their approach shots short. Griffin, Aberg and List meanwhile all found the putting surface, and it was the latter who would go on to roll in a remarkable putt.

From 45 feet, List hit a superb putt across the the green from right to left, before seeing it drop into the hole, piling the pressure on his opponents. Aberg and co were unable to follow the American in, ensuring it was List who came away with his second PGA Tour win.

Discussing his tournament-winning putt, List said: ""Just to have the opportunity to get in a playoff, I felt like, ""˜Wow, OK, this is a gift'. Then my mindset just switched into, ""˜OK, let's try to make a birdie any way I could.' Didn't hit the best (approach) shot but I told my caddie, ""˜I'm making this,' and somehow rolled it in.""

Whilst it may have been a missed opportunity for Aberg, his impressive showing in Mississippi continues his remarkable rise. The Swede only opted to turn professional in June but since then has not looked back, breaking onto the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and most impressively the European Ryder Cup team.



In a bid to make Luke Donald's team last month, the youngster headed to Europe where he won his maiden event as a pro at the Omega European Masters, just 24 hours before his call-up to Team Europe. Just four weeks later Aberg was a Ryder Cup winner in Rome, winning two points on debut including a record-breaking 9&7 win alongside Viktor Hovland against Scottie Scheffler and Brooks Koepka in the Saturday foursomes.

Just days after Aberg was back in PGA Tour action, and despite missing out on his maiden win, he is more than happy with where his game is just four months into his professional career. "" I feel like I'm playing well,"" Aberg said after his tied-second finish.

""I'm swinging it nice. For me to kind of come over here to play after Rome was something that I wanted to do, and obviously I think the round on Thursday kind of set the pace a little bit. It was nice to see a good score coming in, and then I just kept going. Luckily today I found myself quite close to the lead coming down the stretch.""

Reuben is the eldest son of Amanda and Clive - who share nine children in total together - but he is expected to make a huge name for himself in the reality world

One of the sons of Our Yorkshire Farm stars Amanda and Clive Owen is tipped to step out from the shadow of his parents to land a huge reality show career of his own.

Reuben Owen is the 19-year-old son of 48-year-old Amanda and 68-year-old Clive - who have eight other children; Raven, 21, Miles, 16, Edith, 14, Violet, 12, Sidney, 11, Annas, nine, Clemmy, seven, and Nancy, six.

The whole Owen family shot to fame thanks to their appearance on Channel 5 reality series Our Yorkshire Farm which followed the family as they raised their flocks of sheep and worked on their farm.

The series came to an unexpected end last year when Amanda and Clive announced their shock split - pathing the way for Clive and Reuben to feature in a spin-off titled Beyond the Yorkshire Farm: Reuben & Clive.

But now the teenager is tipped to go even further and build a reality show portfolio of his own - not least since Clive decided to step away from the spin-off.

Brand and culture expert, Nick Ede, told MailOnline: ""Reuben could have his own show as he navigates his life in his early 20s or we could see him popping up on a reality show like I'm a Celeb or Dancing on Ice.""

Mr Ede event went on to predict that Reuben could appear on dating shows if his current relationship with girlfriend Sarah Dow goes of the rails.

He added: ""He could possible do a dating show if he splits from his girlfriend like the hit US TV show Farmer Wants a Wife'.""

Amanda and Clive's marriage collapsed last year after 22 years of being husband and wife - with Clive recently opening up about the end of their romance during an appearance on ITV 's Lorraine last week.

He told stand-in host Christine Lampard that he had ""a massive part to play"" in the marital collapse.

He said his family signed up for Our Yorkshire Farm - which ran from 2018 to 2022 - as an ""opportunity."" After describing it as ""successful,"" he added: ""I handled it very badly.""

He continued: ""It was such a change in our lives and I sadly made a right mess of things basically. I had a massive part to play in our relationship ending. A massive part to play.""

""When all this was going on, here I am ranting and raving and drinking and carrying on. I don't know - jealousy,"" he further commented during the recent interview.

Clive suggested that he had felt the project was ""taking [Amanda] away,"" though he added: ""It wasn't. In that she was just doing ... she was committed [to the opportunity].

""But it seemed to eat away at me and I handled it badly and I behaved badly towards her. I should have been supportive and I was doing the absolute opposite.""

Yorkshire shepherdess Amanda Owen says she is 'making it happen' with her ex-husband Clive as they continue to run Ravenseat Farm together

Our Yorkshire Farm star Amanda Owen has revealed she still works with her ex-husband Clive and it's ""easier"" since their split.

The 48-year-old shepherdess and her husband, 68, announced their separatio n in June after 22 years of marriage.

Despite their differences, Amanda explained that they still work together on Ravenseat Farm in the Yorkshire Dales, and look after their nine children.

""People assume that because I'm separated from my husband, Clive, things are harder, but in fact it's the opposite,"" she says in a new interview.

The hardworking farmer went on to explain that they are ""making it happen"" despite their personal struggles.

""We have two farms that are basically next door to each other, so it's close enough for it to be useful, but far enough for us to have space,"" she told The Times.

""Whatever our personal situation, there's a farm to run and nine children to look after so we're just working together, making it happen.""

She also hinted at her growing fame revealed that interacting with her fans on social media, including 533k followers on Instagram, is a lucrative revenue stream.

""I'd like to do more social media posts but there's no mobile signal and I only have internet access from the farmhouse so I can't livestream,"" she said.

""It's pretty hard keeping all the balls in the air, but the reality is that talking about shovelling sh** pays more than shovelling sh**. It's ridiculous, but that's how it is.""

The Our Yorkshire Farm stars share nine children together ranging in age from 21 to 6 and they have been married since 2000, tying-the-knot five years after they met in 1995.

They announced their split in a post on her Instagram Story in June.

She wrote, in a joint statement: ""Clive and I have are sad to confirm that we have made the difficult decision to separate.

""This hasn't been easy, but we both believe it's the right choice for the future of our family.""

The statement continued: ""Although we are no longer a couple, we continue to work on the farm and co-parent together with our number one priority the happiness and well-being of our children.""

Amanda and Clive thanked everyone for their support and asked for privacy during this ""difficult time"".

There had been rumours that the couple were having a rocky time in their marriage for most of this year and Channel 5 star Amanda has appeared on ITV morning show Lorraine to address the speculation in December 2021.

At that time there had been reports for weeks which suggested that the couple were on the rocks and that Amanda has been living away from Ravenseat Farm in a separate rented property as they review their future together.

Talking to Lorraine last year, Amanda said: ""You have your difficult moments. But you have to take the rough with the smooth.

""We've just talked about how you weather a storm [as Amanda and Lorraine had earlier discussed battling Storm Arwen]. So we are pretty resilient in the hills.

""That's all you've got to do. You've got to remember, the bottom line is, if you are proud of what you're doing, you kind of sort of have to shoulder it.""

She added: ""In other words; ""˜Get on with it'. Ignore it""

Our Yorkshire Farm star Amanda Owen has been absent from Instagram for months following her split with husband, Clive, who also starred in the Channel 5 show

Amanda Owen has broken her silence on social media after not posting any content on Instagram for months.

Our Yorkshire Farm fans had expressed their concern for the mum-of-nine, 49, following the shepherdess' split from her husband, Clive, 68. Amanda also told her followers she had closed Ravenseat to the public, saying there would 'no more cream teas' until further notice. However, she's finally given her fans an update, posting four photos of her kids playing in the water.

She captioned the post in which three of her brood can be seen splashing around in the sea as the sun sets: ""The place to be. #Yorkshire #HomeSweetHome."" The post, which was liked by Jeremy Clarkson, went down a storm with the star's legion of loyal followers, who told Amanda they were delighted to hear from her since she last posted on Instagram in July. One said: ""We miss you Amanda hope you are well!"" Another wrote: ""Aww lovely great to see you back on here have missed you allxx."" While a third shared: ""Great to see you posting again, hope you and the family are all ok xx.""

It's been a tough year for the striking shepherdess after Amanda announced she and Clive had called time on their marriage. Making a joint statement, they said: ""Clive and I are sad to confirm that we have made the difficult decision to separate. This hasn't been easy, but we both believe it's the right choice for the future of our family. Although we are no longer a couple, we continue to work on the farm and co-parent together, with our number one priority being the happiness and well-being of our children.""

The farming sensation was reported to be dating businessman Robert Davies, 71 after she split from Clive. Amanda is said to have known Robert for five years and was seen with the septuagenarian in Folkstone, Kent during a fan event. However, after hearing the rumours of a romance, Robert's fourth wife Jan Coates, 72, issued a warning to the mum-of-nine, saying: ""He is very charming but he is also very ruthless in the way he treats people. I think he gets bored easily. I can see what's happened. He loves fame and fortune and he loves money,"" she said.

It was recently reported Clive has accepted Amanda's new relationship and is now focused on 'moving on'. ""People might have felt concerned about him because he had a tough time when they first split but he's moved on now,"" a pal claimed. Speaking to MailOnline, they continued: ""Clive has remained so loyal to her for so long but he's reached the end of the road and now wants to get on with his life. ""He isn't seeing anyone himself but he's a popular and very well-liked man in the Dales and life is full of possibilities again.""

Fans of the popular Our Yorkshire Farms show were stunned after Amanda Owen posted a family update from their farm as she gears up to make her TV comeback next year

Our Yorkshire Farm fans were left doing a double take at a snap posted by Amanda Owen.

The shepherdess, who is a mum-of-nine, took to her social media to share a rare snap of her daughters Edith and Raven ahead of her TV comeback. 14-year-old Edith has not been spotted with her farming clan for a while and shocked fans with her appearance. They were stunned at how ""grown up"" she looked next to her mum and older sister.

Amanda, 49, beamed as she took a selfie with Edith and Raven, 22. They all donned hard hats as they wrapped up for the cold weather on the farm. It appears the trio were overseeing renovations at their Ravenseat Farm, yet many fans were too focused on Edith as they compared the teen to her sister.

One fan wrote: ""Wow! How tall is Edith?! Beautiful pic of you all."" Another added: ""Omg how grown up is Edith?! A spit of you Raven!"" Someone else said: ""Your all so beautiful but little Edith has grown up such a beautiful young lady, so nice to see you guys."" A fourth commented: ""Edith has grown so much!!""

Our Yorkshire Farm was cancelled by Channel 5 in December 2022 following a shake-up to the TV schedule. It coincided with Amanda's split from husband and father of her children Clive, 69, following 21 years of marriage.

Taking to Instagram at the time, Amanda penned: ""Clive and I are sad to confirm that we have made the difficult decision to separate. This hasn't been easy, but we both believe it's the right choice for the future of our family. Although we are no longer a couple, we continue to work on the farm and co-parent together, with our number one priority the happiness and well-being of our children.""

Although the couple are no longer an item, they are set to make a TV comeback and appear alongside eldest son Reuben on new Channel 4 show Our Farm Next Door. It will follow the trio as they renovate the farmhouse they purchased during the last series of Our Yorkshire Farm. Filming has reportedly already started and it is set to air sometime next year.

It comes after Amanda reportedly feared the end of her successful TV career after it was unveiled she allegedly had an affair with 71-year-old web designer Robert Davies, who she is still thought to be involved with. Amanda's ex Clive had initally taken full responsibility for their split, saying: ""It was such a change in our lives [the TV show] and I sadly made a right mess of things basically. I had a massive part to play in the relationship ending. A massive part to play. I was ranting and raving and drinking and carrying on. I don't know - jealousy.""

It was reported that Mr Davies' wife, Yasumi, was heartbroken after she allegedly found a note from Amanda to Robert inside a bag in his car. She then said she confronted her husband, who has been married five times, and he confessed to the apparent affair. Yasumi said: ""Instead of acknowledging my pain, he was more concerned about protecting her TV career.

""I'd watched Our Yorkshire Farm and couldn't help but be impressed by her. She portrayed herself as a wife and a mother, devoted to family, and an inspiration to others. But she's been lying to the public and living a double life.""

The Falmouth Worm Charming Championships in Cornwall saw hundreds of worms lured out of the ground by mollusc fans deploying a wide variety of different techniques

Hundreds of worms were lured out of the ground by mollusc fans at the annual Falmouth Worm Charming Championships.

Records were smashed on Sunday when charmers used tried and tested techniques, old wives' tales and experimental form to encourage the wigglers out of the Cornish soil.

In total competitors managed to charm a staggering 260 worms out with musical instruments, garden tools, interpretive dance and utter madness, Cornwall Live reported.

The total number of worms coaxed up to the surface was well up from last year's championships which was held during a heatwave, and only saw a single worm appear.

Following the inaugural event in Penryn back in 2021, the worm-charming contest organised by artist Georgia Gendall moved to The Dracaena Centre in Falmouth last year.

It was back there again in 2023 featuring worm portraits, worm tattoos, worm charming merchandise and a brass band.

For the competition itself, teams were each given a two-metre square plot of grass and half an hour to get as many worms up as possible, without digging or using any mechanical tools.

Worm charming, worm grunting and worm fiddling are all terms to describe the act of enticing earthworms to the surface of the soil, generally to be harnessed in agriculture or used as bait.

As a skill and profession in 2023, worm charming is now very rare, although the art has been kept alive by earthworm enthusiasts who have passed it through generations to ensure that it survives.

Worms come to the surface naturally in response to rain tapping on the ground, feeling the vibrations through the soil and knowing travel across the ground surface will be easier in the damp.

Birds imitate this by pecking on the floor, or quickly stamping their feet.

At this year's competition, methods of enticing the worms out of the ground included playing various instruments, banging garden forks, dancing vigorously and asking the worms very politely to come up to the surface.

The winning team managed to charm a total of 20 worms within the 30 minutes, setting a new record for the Falmouth Worm Charming Championships, which this year had Arts Council and Feast funding.

They received a tall silver wormlike sculpture made by the French artist Nicolas Deshayes, while the longest worm (22cm) gets a bronze worm sculpture made by Naomi Frears.

A special prize - a shoe with a vibrator and a toothbrush, made by Flo Brooks - is given for the most inventive charming technique, which this year went to a group of women dressed as Titanic passengers who wrote poetry and wolf-whistled to the worms.

However, the overall winners have a long way to go to beat the current world record, which was established on June 29, 2009, by 10-year-old Sophie Smith of Willaston, England.

She managed to raise a staggering 567 worms during Britain's World Worm Charming Championship.

Imber, a ghost village located in Wiltshire, was once a bustling home to more than 150 people until the Second World War, when they were told to leave and never return

In November 1943, the residents of a picturesque village crowded into the school and told they were being temporarily evacuated - but no one ever returned.

The War Office began buying up land in Wiltshire from the 19th century as its isolated location made it a prime site for military operations. At the outbreak of the Second World War 152 people called the village of Imber home. However as floods of American troops arrived in preparation for D-Day it was decided the safety of villagers - previously allowed to remain as tenants - could no longer be guaranteed and were told to leave in 47 days. Some left items in cupboards, believing they would one day be allowed home.

However, to this day Imber still remains an active military training zone with no inhabitants, no postcode, and a maximum 50 days of public access a year. Danger signs warn would-be visitors that unexploded military debris awaits them if they dare venture off the public carriageway and into the village.

Not all villagers believed they would be allowed home. Alfred Nash, is said to have died of a broken heart within a month of being ordered to leave. After the war, a ""Forever Imber"" campaign was launched on behalf of betrayed residents even reached the House of Lords but failed to convince anyone to allow them home.

The first documented evidence of Imber's existence comes from Saxon times, where the village was mentioned in 967. It is also recorded in the Domesday Book, when it was believed the population was just 50.

By the 14th century the population of the village had risen to around 250, and eventually peaked at 440 as recorded in the census of 185, declining to around 150 by the time of Imber's abandonment.

Imber was always quite isolated, but not as devoid of people as it is today - when people lived there, most of them worked in agriculture, or work that directly depended on it.

The church is one of the only building s which has managed to stand the test of time and remain in a reasonable condition - most have become derelict or have been demolished by the Army. When speaking to the BBC , The Friends of Imber Church's John Syme said: ""It's a very important little church and has many memories for local people.""

In 1943, when Imber was evacuated, there was a Baptist chapel, a post office and a pub called the Bell Inn. The pub still stands, as does the manor house, Imber Court. Amazingly, in the derelict village, a farmhouse, cottages, a schoolroom and four ""˜council' house style blocks which were built in 1938 have survived relatively unscathed too.

Many of the buildings suffered major shell and explosion damage after the war, and the village was allowed to fall into disrepair. A public inquiry also found in favour of Imber's continued military use, but it was decided that the church would be maintained and would be open for worship on the Saturday closest to St Giles's day each year, which is a practice that continues to this day.

After the war, the village was still used extensively for training, particularly preparing soldiers for their duties in the urban environments of Northern Ireland. Although training continues at Imber, a purpose-built urban warfare complex has now been constructed at Copehill Down but the public are still warned against going in.

The man was fishing along the edge of a pond in Lowcountry, South Carolina, US, when the frightening reptile climbed out of the water and suddenly lunged at him

This is the terrifying moment a f isherman was charged at by an angry alligator - forcing him to run for safety.

The man, who has not been named, was fishing along the edge of a pond in Lowcountry, South Carolina, US, on Tuesday when the alligator began swimming towards his rod.

In the video, the fisherman is seen collecting his pole before gradually retreating from the pond.

However, it was too late as the reptile climbed out of the water and suddenly lunged at him.

Fortunately, the man was able to reach a safe distance away from the predator as the alligator stopped charging at him after a few seconds.

According to the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, alligators are able to run at speeds of 7.5-9.5mph for short distances.

The predators are normally found in Texas to North Carolina - with the reptile's population in South Carolina said to be around 100,000, according to the state's Department of National Resources.

After the terrifying encounter, the alligator quickly returned to the pond.

Department officials said feeding the alligators can lead to the animals losing their natural fear of humans.

It said: ""In many cases, fed alligators will begin to approach at the sight of people and may become aggressive in seeking a handout.""

It remains unclear if the alligator had been fed on Tuesday, which is also illegal in the state.

The alligator attack comes just weeks after a huge predator was spotted swimming in the sea off Dauphin Island - a holiday destination in Alabama, US.

A shocked beachgoer named Matt was stunned to see the enormous reptile casually swimming in the sea.

He posted the video online, writing: ""Tell me where you can go to the beach and the f***Ing zoo at the same time"".

The video and images were viewed over 75,000 times'.

Matt added: ""The things you never think you'll see. First time seeing a gator on Dauphin Island.

""It was just a very beautiful day and my girlfriend and I were just spending some time on the beach when someone mentioned it.

""So, we walked down to get a better look and snap some pictures. It's not every day something like that happens.

""We see them in Dog River and the Bird sanctuary, but almost never in the Gulf like that.""

He added: ""I knew if I didn't get pictures no one would ever believe it.""

One local resident commented: ""He's body surfing"", with another added"" ""I will freak out if I see this. New fear of the beach unlocked.""

Nicholas said: ""They go there in search of sea turtle eggs.""

Brad remarked: ""That's cool. Crazy, but cool! It's been too long since I've been to the Island.""

A dog who came down with a mysterious illness has made a miraculous recovery - after vets gave him Covid drugs.

The bulldog, named Cash, was struggling to breathe when he was taken to Lyman Vet Clinic in Cass County, Iowa. Veterinarian Doug Swain decided he had nothing to lose and gave him Paxlovid, the antiviral pills meant for humans.

The dog was within days of death, according to the vet, but remarkably was able to recover just days after being given the drugs. ""It's like, 'Why not, what do we have to lose?'"" owner Ryan Knowles told KCCI 8. ""From everything we've read or heard, it's kind of a death sentence if we don't.""

Dr Swain has continued to prescribe Paxlovid to other dogs battling severe cases of the mysterious illness. He told KCCI 8 he noticed owners of the pets had recently been ill with COVID-19 and their symptoms were similar to humans. ""I had COVID and spent nine days in the ICU myself,"" Dr. Swain told the local news outlet. ""When I see these dogs, I think about how I looked.""

According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, the mysterious illness among dogs has been reported in at least 14 states.

Currently, there is no treatment or cure available and the disease is resistant to antibiotics. Symptoms of respiratory illness in dogs include coughing that can last six weeks, sneezing, nasal or eye discharge, and tiredness. Some cases of pneumonia progress quickly, making dogs critically sick within 24 to 36 hours.

Dr. Lindsey Ganzer, veterinarian and CEO at North Springs Veterinary Referral Centre in Colorado Springs, Colorado told TODAY.com the illness happens ""very, very quickly"". She said: ""It seems to happen very, very quickly ""” to go from this cough that's just won't go away ... and then all of a sudden they develop this pneumonia.""

Vets across different states have admitted seeing ""a plethora of these infections and it's concerning. ... We are using our isolation ward heavily with all of these infections"", Dr Gina Kettig, veterinarian at VCA Alameda East Veterinary Hospital in Denver, said. She added over 30 dogs with the condition have been in her clinic since October. It also affects different types of breeds and ages but is most common in dogs who have spent time in kennels or day care centres.

The Oregon Department of Agriculture said the ""illness can progress in three ways such as a mild to moderate cough for six to eight weeks or longer that either doesn't respond to antibiotics or only responds a little. Chronic pneumonia that doesn't respond to antibiotics. And severe pneumonia that ""often leads to poor outcomes in as little as 24 to 36 hours.""

Tulare Lake in California reemerged this past winter due to intense storms and flooding and has submerged farmland and infrastructure, making it dangerous for swimming and other recreational activities

Authorities are urging people not to swim in a ""zombie"" lake that reappeared due to this winter's strong rainfall.

Tulare Lake, located in the San Joaquin Valley of California was once the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River. However, extensive agricultural development and water diversion projects caused it to gradually dry up.

The lake resurfaced this winter due to storms and flooding, but it remains private property and is not safe for recreational activities due to pollutants from farmland and submerged infrastructure.

Authorities are now warning people to ""stay out of the water"" as it is not accessible for swimming or other recreational use due to safety concerns.

This is because the lake, which reappeared due to intense storms and flooding that submerged farmland, roads, and power infrastructure, contains various hazards and pollutants.

The submerged farmland introduces chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers into the water. Additionally, there may be diesel fuel, oil, and manure floating around the lake.

These substances pose a risk to human health and make the water unsafe for swimming or any recreational activities, according to Nate Ferrier, a sergeant with Kings County Sheriff's Office.

Mr Ferrier told the Guardian: ""On the lake, you wouldn't know where you were if you [hadn't heard it] was going on. It's water as far as the eye can see.""

And added: ""It's farmland, underwater. You've got diesel fuel, oil, manure, chemicals used to kill bugs and stuff. You've got a whole lot of things floating around.""

""We're good with folks who want to drive out there and take pictures - I took my own family out there. But stay out of the water.""

Moreover, the lake is considered private property and closed to the public. People have been urged to respect this restriction to avoid legal issues and ensure the preservation of the area.

The presence of underwater power lines and electrical equipment further adds to the potential dangers in the lake.

Authorities have been working to retrieve equipment from the lake, and Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) has conducted testing, employed dive teams, and used airboats and helicopters in their recovery efforts.

The lake's depth is relatively shallow, ranging from 5 to 7 feet, and it is about 178 square miles in size. While the lake has started receding, it is expected to remain at its current size for at least another year.

Although the lake's reappearance has been an extraordinary sight and holds significance for residents who grew up hearing about it, it is crucial to prioritize safety and refrain from entering the water.

Visitors are welcome to take pictures and explore the shoreline, but swimming or any activities in the water are strongly discouraged.

North Korean experts believe the country's leader is ready to give the orders to detonate the nuke despite fears his underground site isn't safe

Experts fear North Korea leader Kim Jong-un is ready to detonate despite fears his underground test site isn't able to contain the radiation.

In 2018, North Korea blew up the Punggye-ri site as part of a charm offensive, having previously conducted six nuclear weapons tests there.

Jacob Bogle, an expert on the country, created a map of satellite photos showing which areas are ready for radiation should Kim Jong-un give the order.

He said: ""US and South Korean officials have assessed that Punggye-ri has been prepared to carry out another underground nuclear test since last year.

""Based on a review of recent satellite imagery of the site, there are no indications that a test is imminent.

""But the area is being maintained and remains ready as soon as Kim Jong-un gives the orders.

""A seventh nuclear test is likely necessary for North Korea to validate new warhead designs, so one is expected, but the timeframe for it is currently unknown.""

Olli Heinonen, former deputy director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), agreed that tunnel three had been restored and was ""likely"" test-ready.


""There is no simple way to predict when a test could take place,"" he said.

Dr Heinonen, who is now a distinguished fellow of the Stimson Center, added that there was a risk of radiation from the blast getting into the water supply.

He added: ""Water from melting snow and rain can enter in through cracks and wash out fission products and plutonium.

""It can transport it with the groundwater, into a small river passing the site, and on to agricultural sites and towns downstream.

""Such contamination could enter into food chains and accumulate in agricultural products, fish, meat and eventually in people.

""Cs-137, Sr-90, and Pu-239, which have long radioactive half-lives, are of concern.""

Dr Heinonen continued: ""The detonation in September 2017 was massive, more than 140 megatons, which has certainly caused cracking of the rock.

""Since the first test, there have been approximately 20 small earthquakes at Punggye-ri, which could have caused additional cracking.""

One woman, who lived just 17 miles from the site before she fled to South Korea in 2016, blamed it for the death of her son.

Using the pseudonym Lee Mi-young, she told Radio Free Asia (RFA): ""He had eight friends, but one or two started to get sick and were diagnosed with tuberculosis.

""All of them died within four years. My son was diagnosed the same way.

""The tuberculosis department doctor said that he didn't know why there were so many young people with tuberculosis in the hospital.

""They didn't know that it was because of the nuclear experiment.""

This year, South Korea is testing 881 defectors who escaped from close to the blast site.

Lee was tested in 2017 and had a dosage of 270 millisieverts - far above the minimum level indicating radiation exposure.

One of her fellow test subjects recorded a dangerous dosage of 1,386 millisieverts - compared to a natural annual radiation dose of two to three millisieverts.

Another local - who fled from Kilju County, downstream from the test site - blamed the tests for a range of maladies in the area.

Using the pseudonym Kim Hwa-young, she told RFA: ""Almost all the Kilju people who came here with me still have headaches.

""They don't get better even if I use all kinds of different medicines.

There is no diagnosis even if I go to the hospital.

""My next-door neighbour, his gums bled and he died. This poor four-year-old kid's body was bruised all over as if it was pinched.

""And later he was diagnosed with leukopenia and died. His gums wouldn't stop bleeding despite all kinds of medicine.""

Data crunched by Top of the Poops has shown how waterways across England and Wales were severely polluted in 2021 by water companies pumping out sewage for millions of hours

In just one year, England and Wales' waterways had sewage pumped into them for at least 3.4million hours, according to recent figures.

Data from 2021, analysed by Top of the Poops, has revealed the horrifying extent to which rivers, canals, the sea and other bodies have been polluted by water companies.

It has also highlighted the most polluted local rivers across England and Wales, where just one waterway had sewage pumped into it on over 2,500 separate occasions.

Numbers from the Environment Agency - crunched by Top of the Poops - has also revealed the water companies most guilty of spilling sewage into the country's water.

The figures were also likely an underestimate because the companies don't always reliably collect data, with some monitoring defective, or absent entirely, it said.

Such is the extent of the pollution, that 2021 saw sewage pumped out into water for the equivalent time of at least 388 years across countless different pollution hotspots.

The River Severn was the most polluted river, and had seen 28,741 hours of sewage pumped into it on 2,656 occasions by Severn Trent Water.

Other companies most responsible for pollution were Yorkshire Water, South West Water, Dwr Cymru and United Utilities.

The River Calder was the second most polluted waterway with 27,901 hours of sewage pumped into it on 4,055 occasions by Yorkshire Water.

The same company was responsible for polluting the River Aire, the third most polluted river, on 4,085 occasions for 21,140 minutes.

These shocking figures came as Tory government ministers were reportedly about to row back on massive multimillion fines for water companies spilling sewage.

Environment Secretary Therese Coffey reportedly thinks that fines of up to £250million for such polluters are ""disproportionate"".

But Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said, during a visit to Oldham, that he would ""welcome tougher fines for water companies"".

20 most polluted rivers in England and Wales and responsible water companies

But it's not just rivers that are being polluted by water companies.

Up and down England and Wales, coastal beauty spots are being spoiled as sewage is pumped out into the sea.

United Utilities is responsible for the majority of coastal pollution hotspots across England and Wales.

This may be to do with data reporting, if other water companies weren't recording or monitoring their own pollution on the coast.

But across the North West, the area has some of the worst pollution spots, stretching up and down the coast.

10 most polluted coastal spots in England and Wales and responsible water companies

This data paints a dire picture for beach-goers, but there are a number of factors that affect the numbers.

The water companies listed above generally are better at monitoring than others, for example, Yorkshire Water monitor 97 per cent of their overflows, meaning the company is more aware of where and when it is polluting.

Similarly, a fact pointed out by a number of water companies is that sewage discharge isn't the only factor in polluting waterways, and other sectors like agriculture and run off of chemicals used in fields can also impact the quality of water.

A Yorkshire Water spokesperson said: ""We completely understand the continued interest in the health of Yorkshire's rivers, and we are working hard to reduce the frequency and duration of storm overflows across our region

""Between 2020 and 2025 we're investing almost £1bn to improve the region's rivers, including the Calder, Aire and Ouse indicating our continued commitment to improving water quality in Yorkshire.""

A Severn Trent spokesperson said: ""We are moving faster than sector targets to improve the quality of the region's rivers. We have committed that our operations will not be the reason for any stretch of river in the whole Severn Trent region to be classified as unhealthy by 2030 and we're continuing to invest £100m a year to go even further in improving river quality.

""We're consistently recognised for our industry leading performance, receiving the highest four-star rating by the Environment Agency, and are committed to being open and transparent about our performance and our plans.

""Many sectors and activities impact on the quality of our rivers so whilst we continue to minimise our impact, we've committed to continue working with others - such as the agricultural sector - to help reduce theirs.""

A United Utilities spokesperson said: ""We care passionately about our customers, communities and the environment and are already reducing the frequency of storm overflow operation by one third and improving almost 200 kilometres of waterways.

""With the largest combined sewer network in the country and 28% more rainfall in our region than the UK average, our investment plans from 2025 onwards will see one of the biggest environmental improvement programmes in the country.

""This will deliver the step change in environmental performance that all our rivers need and which we all want to see.""

A spokesperson from Natural Resources Wales said: ""NRW is concerned about the impact of storm discharges on our water quality. We are taking action to address the issue via the Wales Better River Quality Taskforce.

""The taskforce brings together Welsh Government, NRW, Ofwat, DÅµr Cymru and Hafren Dyfrdwy, with independent advice from Afonydd Cymru and the Consumer Council for Water. Collaboratively, the Taskforce has published a series of action plans to gather greater evidence on the impact of storm overflows on our rivers and the sea to reduce the impacts they cause, to improve regulation and to educate the public on sewer misuse.

""Water companies have a responsibility to the environment, as well as their customers, and they must take this issue seriously. We will continue to challenge the water companies to make sure storm overflows are properly controlled. We will investigate any cases of non-compliance and where appropriate take the required enforcement action.""

The King's most valuable assets are Sandringham and Balmoral, but over the years he also become a major landlord, building sustainable housing developments around England

King Charles built a huge fortune from his own property assets and from building housing developments that made him become a major landlord over the years.

The monarch's most valuable assets are Sandringham with its 20,000 acres and Balmoral, which is surrounded by 50,000 acres.

Sandringham has belonged to the royals for more than 160 years, it has 300 buildings and a grade II listed mansion.

Last year, property firm McCarthy Stone valued the principal residence at £55million - and the whole estate could be worth around £245million, according to agricultural land values supplied by estate agent Strutt & Parker.

Prince Albert acquired Balmoral for Queen Victoria in 1852 and the Scottish castle is valued at £60million.

It is surrounded by mountains, forests, lochs and grouse moors totalling 50,000 acres - with each acre worth between £600 and £1,800.

It is also surrounded by 150 other buildings including Birkhall, a house that Charles used for more than 20 years.

In total, the castle and wider estate are estimated to be worth around £120million.

Meanwhile, Charles has doubled revenues he achieves through rentals on property owned by the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster.

While Charles built a sustainable development in Dorset and began a similar project in Cornwall in the 1990s, the duchy was pushing up its income from renting commercial properties in London, Milton Keynes and Cornwall - almost doubling to £17.6million over the past decade.

The duchy is valued at more than £1 billion and is one of the largest and oldest estates in Britain. Dating back to the 14th century, holdings include the Oval cricket ground, 67,000 acres of Dartmoor and 260 farms.

Analysis by the Sunday Times shows that between 2012 and 2022, King Charles received £212.7 million from the duchy, opting to pay income tax on the figure.

The monarch's personal net is £600million - much higher than the late Queen, whose fortune was calculated at £370million last year.

One of his former aides said Charles carefully rebuilt his finances after his £17million divorce settlement from Diana in the 1990s.

The King's former adviser also said Charles was ""tucking away some money"" from the Duchy - and despite not giving an exact sum, it was described as ""several tens of millions"".



The monarch is known to be meticulous about switching off lights and during an interview with Vogue, he once said he hates throwing anything away - especially clothing items - if he knows he can reuse them in the future.

Charles also earned millions from his Duchy Originals range, with his branded biscuits, beer, herbal medicine and garden tools helping him earn a fortune.

The King set up the company based at his Highgrove House estate, Tetbury, in 1990. It has since become established as a leading organic and natural food brand, and in 2010 went into partnership with Waitrose.

Dima Bushnak was shot dead near her home after shunning the traditional life of her Bedouin village in Galilee, northern Israel. She had been working at a local business to support her family while studying

A 19-year-old woman who shunned a traditional Bedouin lifestyle and opted to work at a local business, study and wear western clothes has been shot dead close to her home.

Dima Bushnak had wanted to support her family while she studied and did not want to follow the usual path for women in her village which mainly involved agricultural work with little interaction with men.

On Sunday just before midnight, CCTV footage showed Dima desperately trying to escape her killer as she reverses her car at speed.

But in her terror, she crashes the vehicle into wall and man with a handgun runs towards her.

As the gunman gets to the driver's window he fires once and runs away before turning back to fire a second shot into Dima.

Moments later a second car's headlights are seen fleeing the shooting, close to the Bedouin village of Sallama, in Galilee, northern Israel.

Dima was rushed to hospital in critical condition where she was later pronounced dead.

She and her family had previously received death threats and her over her choice of lifestyle, family members told local media.

Her mother's car had been set on fire but police had been unable to find out who had done it.

One unnamed family member told local media: ""Just because Dima wanted to get ahead in life, there are some people that decided to threaten her life and in the end killed her.""

The family member added: ""They did not want her to work or study.""

Police did not say if there were any suspects or what they believe might have been the motive.

Dima's murder has become the 78th violent killing in the Arab community this year, a significant increase from the 30 cases reported at this time last year, as reported by the Abraham Initiatives anti-violence watchdog.

Among the victims, she is the sixth Arab female to be killed and the fifteenth woman killed in Israel in 2023.

A dog show, organised by the UK branch of the American Bully Kennel Club, set to take place close to where a young girl was mauled to death has been called off over concerns

An American Bully dog show has been cancelled after concerns over animal welfare.

It was due to be held just five miles from where a six year old girl was mauled by a pack of XL Bully's last month. Police later seized 17 animals.

The breed has been involved in a string of fatal attacks, including the death of a dog walker Ian Symes, 34, who was killed by an 8st 3lb dog called Kong in Fareham, Hants, last August, and 17 month old Bella-Rae Birch, who died in St Helens in March last year.

The dog show, organised by the UK branch of the American Bully Kennel Club, was scheduled to open in Trafford Park, Greater Manchester, Manchester on Saturday.

But on Thursday a spokesman for the venue, Bowlers Exhibition Centre, said: ""After careful consideration and extensive consultation with local authorities, police and the RSPCA we have come to a mutual decision to cancel this weekend's ABKC dog show due to take place at the centre on Saturday.""

The RSPCA welcomed the decision to pull the plug on the event - the second time it has been scrapped this year.

A show in Coventry last February was cancelled in the wake of a BBC Panorama investigation which highlighted the issue of illegal ear cropping of American Bully dogs.

Ear-cropping is where skin at the tops of dogs' ears is cut off to reshape them.

Dr Samantha Gaines, from the RSPCA's charity's companion animals department, said: ""We raised our concerns with the centre and, after considering the impact of holding this event, they have listened and done the right thing. Cruel practices such as ear cropping should not be applauded.""

She added: ""The BBC's recent Panorama and Disclosure documentaries raised some really concerning questions about the welfare of many dogs being shown at these events - with the prominence of dogs with cropped ears a real worry for the RSPCA.""

The charity is calling on the government to close a loophole which allows dogs with cropped ears to be imported into the UK.

Vanessa Waddon, from the dog charity Hope Rescue said: ""The practice of ear cropping is barbaric and is unnecessary.""

She added: ""The only reason they do crop is purely aesthetic. It is to get the dog looking a certain way, make it look more intimidating, enhancing the muscular body tone of the dogs.""

Swimmers have been told not to go in the water off Camaes Bay in Anglesey, North Wales after a number of dead fish washed up in what is suspected to be slurry pollution

Bathers have been told not to get in the water at a popular beach after dead fished started washing up on the shore.

The bodies of the scaly aquatic creatures have started emerging from the sea at Camaes Bay in Anglesey, North Wales following a a suspect ""slurry incident"".

People have been urged to avoid bathing at the beach for 72 hours while Natural Resources Wales investigates the issue. Workers for the organisation are taking water samples in a bid to get to the route of the problem.

""A number of fish including trout and flounders have died and further fish surveys are being carried out today,"" a spokesperson for Natural Resources Wales said today.

""Once our investigation is complete, we will decide what further regulatory action needs to be taken.""

The warning was first issued on Monday, meaning beachgoers should avoid getting in the water until at least Friday.

A spokesperson for the Isle of Anglesey Council said: ""Natural Resources Wales is today responding to an incident at Afon Wygyr, Cemaes Bay, Anglesey. NRW staff are onsite investigating what we believe to be a slurry incident which could affect bathing water quality in the short term and has resulted in a number of dead fish.

""Isle of Anglesey County Council has been informed and is advising against bathing at Cemaes Beach for up to 72 hours. Signage is currently being erected.""

Slurry is a mixture of water and manure which can be a valuable source of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium and is used to grow crops. It also poses risks to human health and the wildlife when it enters rivers and waterways.

The pollution incident will be a blow from holidaymakers who've made the journey up to Camaes Bay, which is the northern most town in Wales and is known for its fishing and kayaking.

In Scotland a similar pollution health warning has been issued, but for dead birds rather than fish.

Some strains of bird flu can pass to humans but this is very rare. It usually requires very close contact between humans and infected birds, the Scottish Government says online.

In February 2021 H5N8 - the most recent avian flu of concern - was found to have infected a small number of people for the first time, in Russia.

An Aberdeenshire Council spokesperson said: ""Our teams have been closely monitoring the number of deaths in the bird population over recent days across the region.

""We have activated our strategy to begin removing carcasses from our shoreline, with around 330 birds having already been removed from Stonehaven beach today (Monday).

""The council has finite resources, but we will look to remove large concentrations of birds from popular areas of highest footfall. People should be aware, however, that there will inevitably be more birds washed ashore with each tide so beaches may not be cleared entirely.

Environment Secretary, Therese Coffey suggested that the root vegetable Turnips would be a suitable alternative while other fruit and vegetables such as tomatoes and peppers were in short supply

Supermarkets in the UK don't appear to be selling turnips after the Tory Government urged shoppers to buy them amid food shortages in stores.

Environment Secretary Therese Coffey suggested turnip would be a suitable alternative while others remain in short supply - seemingly sparking a run on the root veg.

Hours after the MP spoke in the House of Commons, photos emerged of shelves at Tesco saying turnips had been discontinued.

The supermarket told The Mirror turnips have been discontinued for some time.

Shoppers at Sainsbury's also reported a lack of turnips in their stores, with celeriac put in its place instead.

Customers instead were offered swede, a similar root vegetable from Sweden.

Other supermarkets such as Co-op, Asda and Morrisons did not list turnips at all when searched for on their websites.

As growers warned the fruit and veg crisis could last until May, photos emerged of empty turnip crates across the country. At Sainsbury's in Nine Elms, South London, celeriac was sold instead.

An empty crate was turned over at a Tesco store in Ely, Cambs, with a sign stating: ""Sorry out of stock.""

An image from the store's website also showed no turnips available.

And when searching for the veg on Ocado, a notice said: ""We apologise that some produce is currently out of stock.""

Although the shopping site later said it did not currently sell turnips, as did Tesco.

It comes as UK supermarkets impose rations on fresh fruit and veg products as it faces shortages due to bad weather in Morrocco and Spain and high energy costs.

These two countries are some of the UK's biggest importers of fruit and vegetables during the winter months.

British farmers are also struggling to power their greenhouses which are used to grow specific crops during the colder months.

Currently, four UK supermarkets have buying limits imposed on certain items.

Morrisons, Aldi and Tesco are putting limits of two per item and Asda limiting shoppers to three items.

Peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes are the most common item being rationed right now, with Asda adding limits to lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflower, and raspberries.

The Environment Secretary told MPs that the issue of shortages would last for another two to four weeks.

She then told MPs: ""It's important to make sure that we cherish the specialisms that we have in this country.

""A lot of people would be eating turnips right now rather than thinking necessarily about aspects of lettuce, and tomatoes and similar but I'm conscious that consumers want a year-round choice and that is what our supermarkets, food producers and growers around the world try to satisfy.""

Ms Coffey's patronising advice sparked accusations that she was out of touch with ordinary people's needs.

She also claimed the shortages would last two to four weeks.

However, the secretary of the Lea Valley Growers Association (LVGA), Lee Stiles, warned ""it's going to be longer than a few weeks"".

Speaking to the BBC he said: ""The majority of tomatoes, peppers and aubergines are not going to be around in big volumes until May, so it's going to be a longer than a few weeks.""

The Co-op today joined Tesco, Aldi, Asda and Morrisons in rationing certain fruit and veg.

Growers are warning of a shortage of UK leeks amid fears stocks will be exhausted by April. They may need to be imported.

The Government was accused of having ""no urgent plan"" to fix the current shortages by Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine saying people were ""rightly alarmed"" by the chronic shortages the UK is facing.

Hailey Bieber and Justin Bieber have been the subject of weeks of intense pregnancy speculation, with many suggesting the couple are expecting their first child together

Hailey Bieber has appeared to post a subtle hint at potential pregnancy news with a stunning selfie, fuelling speculation she's expecting her first child.

The 26-year-old wed Justin Bieber in September 2018, and according to reports, the model is pregnant with the couple's first baby, with some suggesting she's around 10 weeks pregnant. Hailey seemingly confirmed the news with a strawberry-themed post on Instagram, with her loyal followers convinced she was revealing how far along she was, as a 10-week old foetus would be the size of a strawberry.

She captioned the selfie: ""@maryphillips strawberry makeup,"" alongside a love heart and strawberry emoji. Hailey looked gorgeous in the snap on her Instagram Stories, standing in a dimly-lit room wearing a strapless black dress, and finished off her look with a glossy pink lip and peach blush. Her post comes just after she shared a slideshow of shots on social media but failed to include a photo of her body, prompting her diehard fans to suggest she was hiding a baby bump.

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.

""Are you pregnant?"" one person asked in the comments, as another added: ""She always crops her pics now. Hopefully for baby Bieber."" Hailey's strawberry theme has continued over the last few weeks, as she showed off her fruit-themed manicure, as well as pictures of strawberries on her Stories. ""The baby is the size of a strawberry since she's been on a strawberry kick for over a week,"" one fan suggested, however many are convinced her beauty line Rhode Skin is launching a strawberry-themed collection for summer.

Earlier this month, Hailey - who is the daughter of Hollywood actor Stephen Baldwin - shared a racy snap of her posing in a strawberry-themed two-piece as teased a new product in her debut beauty brand. ""(strawberry emoji) season. new treats are on the way,"" the caption read. And in another post on Instagram, she remained tight-lipped on what the ""treats"" could be. ""Yummy things are on the way,"" she wrote.

Hailey and Justin are preparing to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary, and fans have gone into overdrive speculating that the couple are having their first baby. The Sorry hitmaker wed model Hailey following a whirlwind romance, just weeks after he and on-off girlfriend Selena Gomez ended their relationship for good. However, the model has been subjected to cruel criticism from Selena fans, with thousands of negative comments posted on her social media pages.

""Can we cancel her already?"" one fired, as another added: ""Her entire page is just selfies and naked body parts. Wtf, no creativity."" While one follower alluded to Justin ending his relationship with Selena, writing: ""So Hailey is a BOYFRIEND SNATCHER + GOLD DIGGER,"" as another vicious troll commented: ""YOU CAN NEVER BE HER!!""

Whether you're sheltering from nuclear war or trying to avoid infection in a Last of Us-style or zombie apocalypse - this underground bunker has everything you need to stay safe and protected in Missouri

A self-sustaining apocalypse bunker has gone on the market, and it's perfect for anyone who feels the need to prepare for nuclear war or a Last of Us-style apocalypse.

Nestled in the rolling hills of Mountain Grove, Missouri, just an hour outside of Springfield, the custom-built underground property is the ideal place to hunker down and wait out whatever disaster is going on above. And it's a relatively reasonable price too, on the market with Special Finds for £235,000 ($299,900).

Boasting complete self-sustainability, the three-bedroom home includes two bathrooms, a fully-functional kitchen with a gas oven and stove top, dining area, laundry room and a pantry. There is also central heating and a fresh air intake.

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.

The bunker was designed to be inviting, comfortable and warm - rather than cold, concrete and military. It even has a full-size shower and bathtub as well as regular toilets, instead of composting toilets.

And it's not exactly a small space, spanning 1,250ft it should help with feelings of claustrophobia. The bunker includes a 500-gallon liquid propane gas tank, an 80-foot tall antenna tower and a 24/7 surveillance system with a gate - making it pretty self-sustainable.

The entire property is fenced in, meaning any unwelcome visitors would be faced with a barrier, which could easily be reinforced if we were in an apocalyptic setting. Surveillance cameras would also make it easy to keep an eye on your bunker, spotting intruders before they could invade your safe haven.

It lies on 2.4 acres of land with its own orchard trees ready to bare fruit, and a spring-fed creek for fresh water and plenty of gardening areas. It means there's plenty of room to plant your own crops to help make life in the bunker even more sustainable.

Two lawn and garden sheds allow ample outside storage space with an additional insulated garage and shop building with space for one and a half cars. Located in the Ozarks, the bunker is surrounded by natural beauty.

The area is home to fellow like-minded preppers. This would allow unlimited bartering opportunities if we were to face an apocalyptic event as there are dairy and cattle farms just a mile away.

Many people in the area also sell fresh milk and eggs, meaning if we were to face a zombie apocalypse, there would be limited need to leave the safety of the area to try and head to any stores.

Mountain Grove is a city straddling Wright county and Texas county in Missouri. It has a population of less than 5,000 with the 2019 population estimate sitting at 4,690 residents.

According to the Mountain Grove Chamber of Commerce it's: ""One of the friendliest, most picturesque small towns in the Ozarks"". The area has a rural feel and is surrounded by beautiful scenery.

Lisa Hogan of Clarkson's Farm has apologized to partner Jeremy Clarkson after failing to save the Top Gear presenter a special treat from his fruit garden in Oxfordshire

Lisa Hogan has apologised to partner Jeremy Clarkson after failing to share a special treat she found while exploring his farm in the Cotswolds.

The Irish native took to Instagram on Wednesday to post a disappointing update on the fruit growing at Diddy Squat's orchards, telling viewers that the cloudy weather has negatively impacted their growth. In the short clip, Lisa showcases a bush of raspberries but admits that most of them remain inedible.

""We haven't had enough sun to ripen them,"" Lisa adds, before happening across a lone berry that's ready to eat.

""That one's perfect,"" the 49-year-old noted, eagerly plucking it off the tree. ""Oh, look at that, that's mine. That's disappearing immediately."" Lisa is then heard munching into the sweet snack, before realizing there would be none to bring back for the Top Gear star.

""Sorry, Jeremy. It was going to be for you, oops,"" she quipped. In the comment section below, green-fingered enthusiasts shared their own experiences of growing fruit over the 2023 summer season.

""We've had plentiful this year,"" one person wrote. ""Just pick [sic] red currants and 10 jars of jelly made today."" ""Same here in Ireland,"" another person sympathized. ""Notting ripping [sic].""

Just a few days before sharing her raspberries update, Lisa revealed that the potato crops on the farm were harvesting 'nicely'. The starchy vegetable has been an important staple in the farm shop, with sales of spuds alone making the business around £1,000 a day when it first opened.

Lisa and Jeremy have been dating since 2017 after reportedly being introduced to each other by friends at a party. The public interest in their relationship became more intense after the premiere of Amazon's Clarkson's Farm, in which both parties star as the co-managers of the rural Oxfordshire estate. The couple first moved to the idyllic Chadlington in 2021 to escape the hustle and bustle of London and appear to have fallen in love with country life ever since.

Jeremy, 62, has gushed about Lisa's enthusiasm for agriculture in the past, revealing that the former model is not afraid to get her hands dirty with manual labour.

""Nobody would ever call Lisa down to earth but if you had seen her yesterday,"" he said. ""It was absolutely sluicing it down, and blowing such a gale and my tractor, which is not small, was being buffeted by the winds. The two of us were out, making this fence on the highest part of the bleakest, most wind-set part of the farm.""

Ronan Keating is now a grandad aged 46 after his son Jack had a baby girl - but he is far from the youngest celeb to welcome a grandchild

Ronan Keating has become a grandad at the age of 46 as his son Jack - star of Love Island 2022 - revealed the birth of his baby girl, whose mum hasn't been named.

The former Boyzone frontman proudly hailed his brand new granddaughter as a ""little cutie"" as his eldest son shared a black and white snap of himself cuddling the newborn.

But Ronan isn't nearly the youngest celebrity grandparent around.

From soap stars to Hollywood A-listers, some of the most recognisable faces on screen have welcomed the next generation into their lineages.

Here's a look at some of the surprisingly youthful nans and pops we know.

Danny Dyer

EastEnders star Danny became a grandpa at 44 when his daughter Dani - who also appeared on Love Island - gave birth to Santiago in January 2021, and is now pregnant with twins.

The Cockney ""˜ardman admitted his grandson made him grow up in a way having kids didn't, revealing on their dad-daughter podcast Sorted With The Dyers that it was an ""honour"" to call himself grandad.

""In my head I'm still 20 in a way,"" he said. ""I've just got to try and get my head around the fact that I could be a great-grandad by the time I'm 60.

""That's what freaks me out more than anything else. Then a great great-grandad by the time I'm 80. F**k me.""

Little Santiago, now two, often crops up on Danny's social media, and soon he'll be joined by two baby sisters when Dani Junior gives birth to her and footballer partner Jarrod Bowen's identical twins in June.

Dean Gaffney

Danny's fellow ""˜Enders star Dean also got a family title upgrade aged 43 when his daughter Chloe, then 24, welcomed little Mimi in July 2020.

Having become a dad at the age of 18 with ex-partner Sarah Burge, Dean joked people would mistake Mimi for his own baby when he was out and about with her.

""I'm so proud,"" he said at the time. ""Lots of my mates are becoming dads, but I'm a grandad at the same age.

""The only person I know who's in the same boat as me is Danny Dyer, who has a grandchild at 43. I'll be calling him for tips. We could do grandaddy daycare together!""

CeeLo Green

American singer CeeLo became a grandad at just 35 while his chart-topping 2010 single F*** You was dominating the UK airwaves.

His adopted daughter Sierra Johnson, who had appeared on MTV's hit reality show My Super Sweet 16, gave birth to a son when she was 20.

""I'm a grandfather. I'm 35,"" the Gnarls Barkley singer told Chelsea Handler on her talk show. ""She had a son so I have a grandson.""

He also revealed how Sierra, who is his stepdaughter from his marriage to Christina Johnson, got her TV break when she charmed MTV bosses into giving her an episode of the show before she'd even turned 16.

""She was actually turning 15 on that show,"" he laughed. ""MTV took a liking to her and they allowed her to be an exception for this show.""

Since welcoming more grandkids to the family, Cee Lo told fans on Twitter of their pet name for him. ""My children/grandchildren call me poppi. My lil one Izzy is my biggest fan,"" he revealed.

Kiefer Sutherland

Kiefer Sutherland took some time out of being 24's Jack Bauer to become grandad at 39, after stepdaughter Michelle Kath gave birth to son Hamish Sinclair in 2005.

Describing his grandson as ""a train wreck"", the Lost Boys actor told the Mirror:""He already looks like a failed boxer. He falls down a lot and he gets cut up and he's just beautiful.

""He's one of the great pleasures of my life.""

Kiefer has since welcomed a second grandson, Quinn, into the family, making his actor dad Donald Sutherland, now 87, a great-grandad twice over.

Jessie Wallace

Another EastEnders star joined the grandparent club when Jessie Wallace welcomed little SJ, thanks to her 17-year-old daughter Tallulah, to her clan.

""Welcome to the world, my grandson SJ. You are loved, cherished and adored,"" the 50-year-old Kat Slater star wrote on Instagram of his birth in March 2022.

Tallulah, who stays mostly out of the spotlight, hasn't publicly revealed the father of her baby boy, but a pal said Jessie was ""chuffed to bits"" about becoming a grandmother.

""Her close circle knew Tallulah was pregnant and how excited the family were. They're both looking forward to making a lifetime of memories,"" they added.

Pierce Brosnan

Pierce was already a grandfather by the time he was filming his last four James Bond movies, after his late daughter Charlotte gave birth to little Isabelle Sophie in 1998.

Aged 44 at the time, Pierce was delighted to be promoted to grandad, and has since welcomed three more little ones to the Brosnan crew: Lucas, son to Charlotte, then Marley May and Jaxxon Elijah to his son Sean and his wife Sanja Banic.

Charlotte tragically died in 2013 from ovarian cancer, the same illness that cruelly killed her mother, Pierce's first wife Cassandra Harris, in 1991 aged 43.

""There's still a lot of life in the old man and I'll keep going till I can go no more. Life is so precious,"" the Mamma Mia! Star said in 2015.

""It can be snatched away without any prior warning ""¦ so why waste it? That's why I enjoy my wonderful, beautiful family, my children and my grandchildren.""

Kym Marsh

Waterloo Road star Kym became a grandmother aged 42, but wanted a cooler title when she found out daughter Emilie was expecting baby Teddy.

""I was delighted to become a grandparent but I didn't want to be called ""˜Grandma' or ""˜Nanna',"" she confessed.

""So I started looking at other names. My husband Scott liked the idea of being called ""˜Pop'. Polly, Emilie's stepdaughter, has always called me ""˜Lolly' and I thought it would be nice to be called ""˜Lolly' and ""˜Pop'.""

But Teddy had other ideas. ""As Teddy started talking he began calling me ""˜Yaya', I think he was trying to say ""˜Lolly', and it just stuck from there,"" the former Hear'Say singer added, ""but I looked it up and Yaya is actually a name for grandmother in Greek!""

The WHO has listed nine pathogens they believe are the most 'urgent' threat to humanity. Concerned scientists are urgently researching them, but have excluded one key threat

Covid-19 may no longer be a threat but World Health Organisation bosses are keeping close tabs on infections that pose a risk of sparking another pandemic.

The WHO has listed nine pathogens they believe are the most 'urgent' threat to humanity.

Concerned scientists are urgently researching them, but have excluded one key threat.

Despite the biggest ever outbreak currently sweeping the world, bird flu is not listed.

Avian influenza is not know to transmit easily between humans currently, mutations to the virus that makes mammal-to-mammal transmission easier could change that, some experts fear.

British scientists have also modelled worst-case scenarios under which the virus kills up to one in 20 people it infects, if it ever manages to take off in humans.

Officials said the figure was for 'planning purposes' and not a prediction.

The list of 'priority diseases' on the WHO's website states: ""This is not an exhaustive list, nor does it indicate the most likely causes of the next epidemic.

""WHO reviews and updates this list as needs arise, and methodologies change.""

Professor Francois Balloux, an infectious disease expert based at University College London, told MailOnline : ""I don't know why they chose to exclude flu and bird flu from the list.

""However we look at it, the chance that the next pandemic will be caused by a lineage of influenza is high.""

He added: ""One possibility may be that they wanted to draw attention to some less well-known zoonotic threats, for which preparedness should be stepped up, whereas for flu contingency plans are in place.

""The problem with that explanation is that it doesn't fit with SARS-CoV-2 being on the list.""

Here is the full list of the nine infections that could cause the next pandemic.

Covid

Covid shut down the world in 2020, with lockdowns happening across the globe.

The key symptoms of the infection include breathlessness, a dry cough and a fever, as well as loss of taste or smell.

The virus attacks the lungs and as the body fights back to kill the infection, experts say it can destroy lung tissue and cause inflammation.

This can cause pneumonia, as well as limiting oxygen supply to the blood which causes a variety of life-threatening issues.

The virus is now considered an 'established and ongoing health issue', after the WHO downgraded the threat level earlier this month.

Lassa fever

Lassa fever is a rodent-borne disease thought to cause no symptoms in 80 per cent of patients and kill just one per cent of those it infects.

People usually become infected with Lassa fever after exposure to food or household items contaminated with urine or faeces of infected rats.

Last year, a person in Bedfordshire died after catching the disease.

The unidentified individual was the third member of a family who recently returned to the UK from West Africa to become infected with the virus.

A total of 11 cases of Lassa fever have ever been detected in the UK, and is instead endemic in Nigeria, as well as Liberia and Guinea.

Zika

A flavivirus, a type of RNA virus, Zika is transmitted through the bite of infected female mosquitos.

The NHS says it can also be very rarely transmitted through sex.

For most people, the infection is mild and not harmful but it can cause problems for pregnant women.

The first recorded outbreak was in 2007, from the Island of Yap - Federated States of Micronesia.

Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific have also seen outbreaks,

The mosquito-borne virus sparked global panic in 2016, after millions were infected, causing scores of babies to be born with birth defects such as microcephaly.

Yet since 2016 more than 80 countries have faced Zika outbreaks.

Common symptoms include a high temperature, headaches, sore, red eyes, swollen joints and joint and muscle pain.

'Disease X'

Disease X is the mysterious name given to the very serious threat that unknown viruses pose to human health. Disease X is on a short list of pathogens deemed a top priority for research by the WHO.

We have no idea what Disease X can do, because we don't know what Disease X is after it first appeared on the list in 2018.

Disease X, which first appeared on the WHO's list in 2018, represents a hypothetical, currently unknown pathogen.

The UN agency adopted the placeholder name to ensure that their planning was sufficiently flexible to adapt to a disease.

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne virus which can prove fatal in up to 40 per cent of cases.

People can also become infected after contact with blood or tissue of infected livestock.

It can spread between humans through bodily fluids or among hospital patients if medical equipment is not properly sterilised.

The disease shares similar symptoms to Ebola at the start of infection including muscle aches, abdominal pain, a sore throat and vomiting.

It can also trigger bleeds, usually from the nose or from broken capillaries on the eyes and skin.

Other symptoms of the virus, which come on suddenly, include fever, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and sensitivity to light.

The WHO warns that CCHP outbreaks are a 'threat to public health services' and 'potentially results in hospital and health facility outbreaks'.

Nipah and henipaviral diseases

The incurable virus can be caught from pigs or by people eating fruit or drinking palm wine contaminated by infected bats. It can also be transmitted between people.

Nipah has killed more than 260 people in Malaysia, Bangladesh and India in the past 20 years, according to the World Health Organization.

The first known outbreak, in Malaysia in 1998, killed more than 100 people after they contracted the disease from infected pigs.

Nipah symptoms - which can include fever, headache, drowsiness and confusion - usually appear between five and 14 days after contracting the virus and may last for two weeks.

However, in serious cases people can progress into a coma within 24 hours of symptoms starting, and some people have breathing problems.

There is no treatment for the virus so people receive supportive care to try to relieve their symptoms.

Rift Valley Fever

Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral disease most commonly seen in domesticated animals in sub-Saharan Africa, including cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels.

People can get RVF through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals, or through bites from infected mosquitoes.

Most who contract RVF either experience no symptoms or a mild cold-like illness with fever, weakness, back pain and dizziness.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, however, up to one in ten who contract RVF can develop severe symptoms which may include eye disease, excessive bleeding or even encephalitis ""” swelling of the brain.

It does not knowingly transmit between humans.

Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus disease

Ebola, which kills around half of those it infects, also made the list, alongside Marburg.

Both are haemorrhagic fevers ""” where organs and blood vessels are damaged, causing bleeding internally or from the eyes, mouth and ears.

These viruses can be spread by touching or handling body fluids of an infected person, contaminated objects or infected wild animals.

Ebola causes vomiting, diarrhoea, a rash, yellowing of the skin and eyes and bleeding from multiple orifices.

Marburg, one of the deadliest pathogens ever discovered, with a case-fatality ratio of 88 per cent, also causes similar symptoms to Ebola.

Infected patients become 'ghost-like', often developing deep-set eyes and expressionless faces. This is usually accompanied by bleeding from orifices.

Earlier this year, Equatorial Guinea and the United Republic of Tanzania were both hit by surges of the untreatable virus.

The outbreak saw 17 laboratory confirmed cases and 12 deaths in Equatorial Guinea as of May 1, with neighbouring countries Cameroon and Gabon restricting movement along their borders over concerns about contagion.

Nine cases and six deaths were recorded in Tanzania, as of April 30.

462,"Fuming Snowdonia visitors demand 'self-righteous' locals give a 'warmer' welcome","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/fuming-snowdonia-visitors-demand-self-30203642","Fuming Snowdonia visitors demand 'self-righteous' locals give a 'warmer' welcome

A row has broken out between locals and visitors to the Eryri National Park as some feel rules around parking are too stringent whereas others believe tourists think they are owed too much

Furious Snowdonia visitors have demanded that ""self-righteous"" locals give them a ""warmer"" welcome.

Some walkers and climbers to Eryri National Park have been left fuming after scenes emerged of cars being towed from the roads.

But it has sparked a debate as some seasoned visitors have admitted mixed feeling as the national park soars in popularity and locals have been left suffering, they claim.

The honeypot area tends to attract visitors from across the country, especially when the weather turns warmer, but some of whom park illegally or dangerously.

This has become such a problem the national park instituted a zero-tolerance policy.

But some have said this has gone too far.

A blogger accused rural communities of being too quick to condemn anyone who wants to visit the countryside.

He said: ""The root cause of the parking issues is not hundreds of insensitive louts being lazy or ignorant - the vast majority are decent people stuck with nowhere to park and poor alternative provision.

""It should not be beyond the national park and local authority capability to anticipate peak crowds and make appropriate provision that make's visitors welcome and well catered for.

""Instead we are presented with a self-righteous, insular, let's-tow-away-their-cars-and-that'll-show-em type attitude, which is counterproductive and, most of all, ungenerous. Let's see more constructive and generous proposals rather than this biting of the hand that feeds.""

The numbers of visitors to Eryri surged from 2017 to peak pre-Covid pandemic, and locals believe numbers have rocketed once again since.

But, North Wales Live reported how locals are left bearing the brunt of the problems including the indiscriminate parking, littering, off-lead dogs, and disposable barbecues left around the place posing a fire risk.

Tensions appear to be rising, the outlet said, but for regular visitors, there is some sympathy for locals. Writing on Facebook, one man said ""99% of the people.... are friendly and welcoming"".

But he added: ""I've been climbing and hiking in North Wales for nearly 20 years and whilst ascending the Llanberis path (on Yr Wyddfa) recently, I was told by a local in Llanberis to ""go back to where I belong"". Wherever that is!

""Inconsiderate parking and littering infuriates me as it does most other people. Unfortunately, the minority once again ruin it for the majority.""

Over Easter, almost 40 vehicles were towed from Pen-y-Pass on Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon) and the A5 in the Ogwen Valley.

Eryri National Park has a long-term goal of greater sustainability, and a key part of that is reducing reliance on cars.

The national park is now ringed with park-and-ride sites and an app has been launched to guide visitors to car parks with free spaces, and shuttle buses run continuously to places like Yr Wyddfa and Llyn Ogwen.

For locals blighted by inconsiderate parking it's a bitter pill to swallow. In April, the A5 was closed for several hours as police battled to clear double-parked vehicles.

Locals were stuck at home and farm livestock went untended.

Heading into the summer season, when visitor numbers traditionally peak, there are fears of more to come.

Snowdon Mountain Railway is this month resuming summit services and reopening its long-closed Hafod Eryri cafe - a move expected to bring more people to the already crowded peak of Wales' highest mountain.

Vehicles causing a hazard should be removed, insisted one local. ""I wouldn't expect anything else if I parked up on Manchester ring road and went shopping for the afternoon,"" he said. Another questioned: ""So people will risk being towed and putting others lives at risk for the sake of £20 per car? Unbelievable!""

A local woman accused some visitors of a lack of consideration for the communities into which they enter. ""There seems to be a post-Covid attitude of entitlement that they can do what they like, when they like and how they like,"" she said. ""Abuse by some visitors is on the increase - not all, but the numbers are rising.""

The preference by some visitors to park at the foot of mountains, rather than use park-and-ride facilities, is a challenge facing the park authorities. Walkers complain that, after a tiring day on the mountains, the last thing they want is to ""wait an hour for a bus"".

However, Eryri National Park believes its approach is bearing fruit. ""Only a small minority of visitors are not following the guidelines, said a spokesperson. ""We are very grateful for everyone's cooperation in this regard.""

Prince William will join stars announcing the winners at the Earthshot Prize ceremony during the environmental event in Singapore which hopes to find solutions to 'repair' the planet

Prince William is to be joined by the son of a late famous conservationist for the latest Earthshot Prize and is expected to fly in for the ceremony on the cheap.

The Prince of Wales will be joined by a host of stars as he announces the winners of his environmental initiative in Singapore and is expected to arrive on a commercial flight rather then a private jet. Robert Irwin, the son of the late Australian wildlife conservationist Steve Irwin, will also take part. Irwin is poised to join Oscar winner Cate Blanchett and actors Lana Condor and Nomzamo Mbatha, during the Prince of Wales's event on November 7, aimed at recognising solutions to ""repair"" the planet.

Blanchett, a member of the Earthshot judging panel, said: ""The Earthshot Prize is, again, highlighting and incentivising courageous, progressive, and inventive solutions that can be rapidly upscaled. We don't have time for inaction and despair, and the incredible climate solutions from around the globe are cause for genuine hope. The climate solutions showcased by the prize are wildly exciting - exciting because they are so simple, so possible, and so inevitable.""

Skincare fans praise Revolution's 12-day Pro Miracle advent packed with huge £45 saving

Steve Irwin, a zookeeper and television personality presented wildlife shows caught the imagination of audiences in his homeland and across the globe before he died in 2006 after being stabbed by a stingray. His children, Robert and Bindi, have continued his legacy - working in wildlife conservation and appearing on television. William held his first Earthshot Prize awards ceremony at London's Alexandra Palace in 2021, with Boston hosting the event last year. It is an ambitious project which each year presents five category winners with £1 million each to scale up their environmental ideas.

Among the 15 finalists are Enso, a British based company which has created a more efficient electric vehicle tyre that sheds less particles, while Sea Forest from Australia has developed a seaweed-based livestock feed to reduce the planet warming methane emissions from cattle and sheep. The night will be hosted by Hannah Waddingham, who performed similar duties when Liverpool staged the Eurovision Song Contest earlier this year.

William, along with celebrity supporters of Earthshot, is expected to fly to the Southeast Asian country by a commercial, not private flight. Other measures will be in place to make the event as sustainable as possible, organisers say. During his four-day trip which begins on November 5, the prince will take part in Earthshot Week.

The volcanic eruption at the SundhnjÃºka crater happened near Hagafell on the country's Reykjanes Peninsula on Monday night after thousands of small earthquakes in recent weeks

Fountains of lava shot hundreds of feet into the air from a fissure two and a half miles long as Iceland was rocked by a major volcanic eruption after suffering weeks of earthquakes.

The eruption took place at 10.20pm on Monday at the SundhnjÃºka crater happened near Hagafell on the country's Reykjanes Peninsula. Fishing town Grindavik had already been evacuated. The region - broadly known as Fagradalsfjall volcano - had been active for more than two years as thousands of small earthquakes rattled the area in recent weeks. Scientists were expecting it but its exact date couldn't be predicted.

Locals were warned to stay indoors and close windows to protect themselves from toxic volcanic gases. The wind has been blowing the gases out to sea but there is concern the capital Reykjavik could be hit if it changes. President of Iceland Gudni Thorlacius Johannesson had to declare a state of emergency for the second time in recent weeks.

Here is a look at what happened and what may be ahead:

How the eruption unfolded

It started at about 10.20pm local time on Monday north of Grindavik, a fishing town of 3,400 people on the Reykjanes Peninsula. The town is about 50 kilometers (31 miles) southwest of Iceland's capital, Reykjavik, in an area known broadly as Fagradalsfjall volcano.

First there was a series of small earthquakes. Then lava that's some 1,200 degrees Celsius (2,192 degrees Fahrenheit) began pouring out of a fissure about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) long. The Icelandic Meteorological Office estimated that hundreds of cubic meters of lava per second flowed out in the first two hours of the eruption, though the activity had significantly subsided by Tuesday afternoon.

Was it expected?

In short, no ""” scientists had expected the eruption for several weeks and in November, authorities evacuated Grindavik after thousands of small earthquakes shook the area for more than two weeks. Scientists said their monitors showed that a corridor of magma, or semi-molten rock, was spreading toward the town and could reach the surface imminently.

The nearby Blue Lagoon geothermal resort, one of Iceland's best-known tourist attractions, had to close temporarily as a precaution after a magnitude 4.8 earthquake hit the area last month. Fagradalsfjall had been dormant for some 6,000 years but it flared to life in March 2021, when hundreds of people flocked to the Reykjanes Peninsula to see spectacular lava flows that lasted for months. The red glow from the lava could be seen from the outskirts of the capital.

Will this eruption affect flights?

None of the recent eruptions on the Reykjanes Peninsula caused damage or disruptions to flights, despite the area's proximity to the country's main Keflavik Airport. And though Monday's eruption appears to be larger and more powerful than those in recent years, forecasters and scientists say it's unlikely to impact air travel.

Many still recall the huge disruptions to international aviation in 2010, when a different Icelandic volcano, the Eyjafjallajokull, spewed giant clouds of ash high into the atmosphere over Europe. Some 100,000 flights were grounded, millions of international travelers stranded and air travel was halted for days because of concerns the fine ash could damage jet engines.

Experts say the location and features of this eruption mean it isn't expected to produce much ash or cause a similar scale of disruption. AccuWeather, a US-based weather forecasting firm, said Tuesday that initial information shows no ash cloud has yet been observed. Sam Mitchell, a volcanologist at the University of Bristol, says Monday's eruption is very different to Eyjafjallajokull's in 2010, when ""a large explosive eruption under a glacier produced a very large cloud and very fine ash in the atmosphere when the wind direction was pointing towards mainland Europe.""

What other impacts could this eruption have?

Scientists say that there is no current threat that the lava will reach the town of Grindavik or key structures like nearby power plants. The residents from the area have been evacuated and most surrounding roads remain closed. But the scientists warn the situation could change and that it's too early to say how long the eruption will last or when local residents could move back into their homes.

""Even though the lava did not erupt into the town of Grindavik or at the nearby power plant and popular tourist destination, the Blue Lagoon, the lava flows are still only a few kilometers away and there is still concern of lavas reaching these key locations,"" Mitchell said.

The molten lava flowing above ground can also heighten the risk of poor air quality in the region because of the increased sulfur dioxide content in the air, AccuWeather said. Iceland's Met Office forecast that gas pollution may be detected in the area of Reykjavik later Tuesday or Wednesday. One volcanologist, Ãrmann HÃ¶skuldsson, told Iceland's state broadcaster RUV that he expected the eruption could last from a week to 10 days. ""If everything is normal, this will subside in the afternoon tomorrow,"" he said.

How common are volcanic eruptions in Iceland?

Iceland is one of Earth's most volcanically active areas, with 32 active volcanic sites. It averages an eruption every four to five years ""” though the frequency has increased closer to every 12 months since 2021. The country sits on top of a volcanic hotspot and what's called the mid-Atlantic ridge, a huge crack in the ocean floor caused by the separation of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates. As the plates pull apart, new magma rises up to fill the gaps, triggering earthquakes and volcanic activity.

One of the country's largest active volcanoes is Katla, which is closely watched because it lies under thick glacial ice, meaning that any eruption could melt the ice and trigger widespread flooding. Katla last erupted in 1918, and that eruption lasted almost a month, starving crops of sunlight and killing some livestock.

Major, an 11-year-old Anatolian Shepherd, suffers from osteoarthritis due to his monster-frame - and he's the biggest pooch the Dogs Trust in Loughborough have ever cared for

A huge 12.7st dog which stands almost 4ft tall and needs a ramp to get into a car is looking for his forever home.

Major, an 11-year-old Anatolian Shepherd, suffers from osteoarthritis due to his monster-frame. He is the biggest pooch the Dogs Trust in Loughborough have ever cared for - but volunteers say he's a ""gentle giant"", who just needs a loving home. Celine Di Crocco, rehoming centre manager at the trust, said: ""Major is the biggest dog we have ever cared for.

""Despite his size, he embodies the gentle giant spirit that has endeared him to everyone at the rehoming centre. Major's story serves as a powerful reminder of the responsibilities that come with pet ownership and the potential weight management challenges in dogs.

""While being a bigger dog might mean there's more of him to love, it's essential that owners understand the importance of supporting their dog to maintain a healthy weight to prevent some of the health issues that come as a result of obesity."" Major is on a weight-loss programme which includes regular exercise and a carefully-managed diet.

The charity says he enjoys human company and would love to live in a home where he can be surrounded by people. Despite his age, he loves playing chase and running around with other dogs. Major is now seeking a permanent and loving home to call his own. He can live with children aged 12 years and over, and the possibility of living with another calm dog exists, pending successful introductions at the centre.

However, households with cats or small animals may not be suitable for Major. On the other hand, he could potentially thrive in an environment with other large animals, such as livestock or horses. Anyone willing to give Major a forever home can visit www.dogstrust.org.uk/loughborough.

The grassy expanse at Balmer Lawn in the New Forest, which became a National Park in 2005, has become bumpy, which led to recent research by experts at Forestry England

The enigma surrounding a peculiar lunar-like landscape in a popular National Park has finally been solved by an ecology expert.

When a grassy expanse at Balmer Lawn in the New Forest became bumpy, mystery shrouded the change in appearance. Some speculated the involvement of a hyperactive colony of moles, while others wondered if yellow meadow ants were the culprits, as they're known for their penchant for crafting ant hills in grassland habitats.

But now Leanne Sargeant, a senior ecologist from Forestry England, said the agency believes the landscape has changed because an area of moor grasses has dried out, likely as a result of climate change.

She said: ""There has been some debate in the past about what caused the bumpy lawn but we believe that this is an area of old molinia tussocks that have dried out over the years causing the peat around the molinia to shrink, as the ground has lowered, the molinia tussocks have vegetated over with other species that can cope in the drying ground.""

The unusual topography was captured by photographer Matt Pinner, who himself took to social media to solicit theories about its cause. Forestry England, though, has studied the grassy expanse on land it manages near Brockenhurst, Hampshire, for some time.

Tourists in New Forest had been baffled by the hundreds of odd lumps recently. Photographs show the lumps peppering the vast stretch of grassland, which is heavily grazed by livestock including ponies, donkeys and cattle.

New Forest, designated a National Park in 2005, receives more than 13 million visits from tourists each year, figures show. Total spending associated with leisure visits to the New Forest is estimated at around £107.6 million. Approximately 30 per cent of jobs in the New Forest are provided by the tourism industry.

At this time of the year the River Baragoi is usually in full flow and the villagers have had no problem using water for drinking, cooking and washing - not any more

The children carefully scoop the precious water from the bottom of the holes they have dug deep in the scorched riverbed.

They meticulously tip the water into yellow and white containers ready for their mums to take home.

They need this water to survive.

Without it they will die.

The water may contain deadly cholera but it's their only chance and they just have to take the risk.

At this time of the year the River Baragoi in Kenya is usually in full flow and the villagers have had no problem using water for drinking, cooking and washing.

Not any more - East Africa is experiencing its worst drought since Live Aid in 1984, with 120 million people struggling to survive.

They have to dig to find it and it can be dangerous work.

In a nearby village four people stood on each other's shoulders to pass the water up.

But the hole collapsed, killing them.

Traditional waterholes used for centuries have either dried up or have become dangerous disease ridden oversized puddles.

Anna Leaburia, 82, is painfully thin, and she remembers the time when water was plentiful She said: ""I'm an old woman and in all my years I've never seen a situation like this.

""When we were young there was plenty of water and plenty of food.

""It's terrible. It's the worst ever.

""Now there is so little water and it's difficult to get. We used to be happy and we were healthy.

""Times have changed so much. I only eat one meal a day and never any meat.

""Our people are suffering because of the lack of rain.""

As the children, no older than eight or nine, scoop out the water in the three holes next to each other they start to play a water game spraying themselves.

One mum gently chides them, reminding them just how valuable the water is.

A girl, using a red coffee mug to scoop, has carefully placed her blue sandals with the words ""LoveLoveLove"" next to the container.

Another girl, using a green breakfast bowl, is wearing a pink Hello Kitty dress donated by a charity.

They dig for hours on end.

Joe Mbalu, of the Kenya Red Cross explained: ""This is the only way the families can get water.

""At this time of the year this river should be running fully with families able just to come to the banks and collect water easily.

""But the droughts have been so bad for so long that they are forced to do this.

""The women and children sit in the middle of barren river bed each day and dig down.

""At the moment they are perhaps one metre or one metre and a half down and it is not dangerous.

""They scoop the water into containers and it is used for drinking water.

""The water is not clean and would not pass safety standards but it's all they've got and it has been slightly purified by going through the sandy riverbed.

""But come August and September those children will be in holes that could get as deep as three or four metres.

""That's what they have to do to get water and stay alive.

""That's the way it is here now.""

There is deadly cholera present in the water but it is at low levels at the moment.

Cholera, which is contracted by drinking infected water, is one of the region's biggest killers.

""If the levels increase we would warn the locals immediately,"" said Joe. ""But obviously we cannot force them to stop digging.

""And they will continue because without water they will die. This water actually gives them a chance of life.""

The desperate search for water across the region can be extremely dangerous and can lead to tragedy.

Digging in dried up riverbeds has become very common and often can be a complex and dangerous operation.

Village Elder Mpatin Leerech, 63, said: ""We have serious problems getting water.

""In our village we dig deep into the riverbed to scoop out the water.

""But we shouldn't be doing it at this time of the year ""¦ ever.

""People have died digging for water and some-times there are four or five people standing on top of each other's shoulders.

""The one at the bottom scoops the water into a cup then he passes it to the next and so on until it reaches the surface.

""It takes so long and it is so dangerous.

""Even though we try to use tree branches as supports, sometimes the hole collapses and it kills the people inside it.

""On another occasion a cow was walking on the riverbed and fell into the water hole and crushed someone at the bottom and they died.""

Mpatin lost an eye as a child when he was chased by an elephant, fell and a branch speared through his eyeball.

He has seven wives and three children but is hungry and thirsty much of the time.

""I only survive on the generosity of family members,"" he said.

""The water shortages have killed all our livestock. We have to get water anyway we can.""

Africa food crisis - how to help

The British Red Cross has an appeal to raise money to help.

Because of the war in Ukraine and the earthquake in Turkey and Syria, the drought has dropped off the public's radar.

A ""famine"" has not yet officially been declared but the sheer numbers of people dying brings back terrible memories of 1984/85.

Richard Blewitt, executive director of international for the British Red Cross, said: ""The Africa food crisis is a catastrophic, deadly emergency on a scale we haven't seen in recent history. Right now, more than 140 million people are struggling without the food they need to survive.

""But there is hope, with the right support and more investment from governments we can get help to where it's desperately needed.

""We know that money is tight for many people here in the UK, but if you are able to give what you can, our Red Cross teams on the ground can reach communities with life-saving aid and help build long-term solutions.""

You can donate at https://donate.redcross.org.uk/appeal/africa-food-crisis-appeal or call 0300 023 0818

Every Wednesday he rises at 4am to walk from his village Lokeresire to the nearest market searching for cheap food.

It's a staggering 33 miles each way.

He will cover it all and back in around 17 hours and thinks nothing of it.

The water here is so short even most of the animals have moved on.

Locals said that there are far fewer animals in the area as they move south in search of food.

There used to be elephants, giraffe and zebra across the landscape as far as the eye can see.

Now they are far used to seeing camels who survive much more easily in desert like conditions.

And the children will keep missing school to keep digging for water in the riverbeds.

Marie has launched a petition asking for dog-on-dog attacks to be made a specific offence after her husky was mauled on the beach by dangerous dogs

It's not only humans at risk from dog attacks. Website GoFundMe has reported a surge in fundraisers by people struggling to pay vet bills for pets which have been mauled.

Marie Hay was hit with a £30,000 bill after an incident on a beach in Redcar, North Yorks, earlier this year left her husky Naevia with appalling injuries. The dog was hospitalised for two weeks and lost 83% of her blood - with insurance covering only £4,000.

Mum-of-four Marie says: ""It was horrific. When I got the quote from the vet, I sat with my head in my hands and cried. Getting her put to sleep would have been my absolute last resort.""

Donations worldwide raised £42,000, with the surplus after her costs helping nine other owners pay bills.. Marie has since launched a petition asking for dog-on-dog attacks to be made a specific offence, similar to worrying livestock.

British Veterinary Association (BVA) figures show almost one in four vets reported an increase in pets attacked by dogs. The BVA has joined animal welfare charities in calling for an overhaul of the Dangerous Dogs Act.

The Association of British Insurers said claims for dogs leapt by 35% last year with payouts up 23% to £800million. It added: ""Emergency treatment can be eye-wateringly expensive.""

King Charles today read out the Government's plans as Rishi Sunak desperately tries to cling to power, with a cigarette sale ban and a shake-up of renting rules among measures announced

Rishi Sunak's desperate attempt to stay in power has been set out by King Charles in Parliament today.

His flagship pledge to outlaw cigarette sales was among the measures read out in the King's Speech, as well as new sentencing rules and protections for renters (with a big catch, as outlined below). There were 21 bills put forward at the State Opening of Parliament, with the Government also laying out plans for self-driving vehicles, clamping down on pedicabs and policing Netflix.

Here we look at some of the key bits of legislation ministers hope to get through before the General Election, which is expected to happen at some point next year.

Banning cigarette sales and vaping crackdown

This is the flagship Rishi Sunak hopes to be remembered for - the ""first smokefree generation"". Under the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, those born on or after January 1 2009 will never be able to legally buy cigarettes. The Government is also planning measures to target vaping, particularly sales to children.

These include limiting flavours and descriptions and the type of packaging. Rogue retailers will face stronger enforcement. Age verification will be strengthened, the Government says.

New protections for renters - eventually

The long-awaited Renters (Reform) Bill, which ministers say will help 11 million private landlords, will finally see an end to ""no-fault"" evictions. But there's a catch, as the documents circulated today confirm that this won't happen until ""stronger possession grounds and a new court process"" is in place. You'll remember this caused a massive spat a few weeks ago.

There's good news for landlords, with new powers to evict anti-social tenants. And a blanket ban on pets will also be scrapped, with tenants given the right to request a pet - which landlords can't ""reasonably"" refuse.

Leasehold rules shake-up

The Government's long-awaited move to help homeowners struggling with the monster costs of extending their lease is finally seeing the light of day. The Leasehold and Freehold Reform Bill will make it ""cheaper and easier"" for those in houses and flats to extend their lease or buy the freehold. The standard lease extension will go up from 90 years to 990 years.

There will also be a ban on creating new leasehold houses - but not flats. The Government says it will consult on capping existing ground rents, although there is no solid commitment to do so.

New rules around self-driving vehicles

It's been a bit of a grey area where legal responsibility lies for cars that drive themselves. Now the Automated Vehicles Bill will ensure it's companies who carry the can if things go wrong.

It will give people immunity from prosecution when a vehicle is driving itself, as the Government says it ""doesn't make sense"" to hold the person at the wheel responsible. It says: ""While the vehicle is driving itself, a company rather than an individual will be responsible for the way it drives.""

This means companies that fail to meet safety requirements face signs and sanctions, with prosecutions in serious cases.

Stricter regulation for football clubs

The Government says it plans to bring in a new independent regulator for English football clubs to prevent another club collapsing like Bury FC. It claims that this new body will have teeth - requiring teams in the top five divisions to get a license.

Directors will have stricter tests, while there will be more requirement to engage with fans - with owners no longer to change badges, names or shirt colours without their backing. The Football Governance Bill will also prevent breakaway leagues and ensure TV money is shared more fairly.

Tackling rip-off subscriptions and shady online firms

According to the Government, a new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill will make it harder to trap you in subscription services you no longer want. It will also include measures to deal with fake reviews and drip pricing - where only part of a product's price is advertised upfront.

Although light on detail at this stage, ministers say there will be ""stronger powers"" to deal with anti-competitive practices. The bill will also ramp up the powers of the Competition and Markets Authority.

Policing Netflix and the BBC

There's a lot going on in the Government's proposed Media Bill - including new responsibilities for streaming services such as Netflix. A new video-on-demand code will ""ensure standards are upheld"", with Ofcom given powers to enforce it.

The Bill so includes a requirement to modernise the ""mission statement"" for public service TV such as the BBC, ITV, STV, Channel 4 and Channel 5. This will encourage them to ""focus on what makes them distinctive"", but documents circulated ahead of the King's Speech don't elaborate.

It will also require better access to subtitles, audio description and signed interpretation, and give Welsh-language broadcaster S4C more leeway to broaden its audience.

Rail shake-up

The Draft Rail Reform Bill sets out numerous ways of trying to improve Britain's broken rail system, such as a shake-up of ticketing. Under the plans fares will be simplified, and single leg pricing will ensure one-way tickets don't end up costing almost as much as returns.

It will also ensure the Transport Secretary won't be able to make decisions about franchises, instead setting up a new body called Great British Railways to do so. It will also include a requirement for accessibility to be improved, particularly for disabled passengers.

Forcing criminals to attend their sentencing hearings

This is a massive victory for campaigners, and something The Mirror has long been calling for. Under the Criminal Justice Bll defendants will be ""compelled"" to appear in court as they're sentenced, following a string of high-profile cases where they've hid in their cells.

There will also be a new ""aggravating factor"" in sentencing for those involved in grooming gangs A similar measure will be brought in for those who murder their partner when their relationship ends. Sharing intimate images will be criminalised, as will encouraging self harm.

People who work will children will be required by law to support any concerns about sex abuse under the Bill. Meanwhile probation services will be given more powers to use polygraph tests on terrorists or sex offenders and drug testing on arrest will be expanded.

There will be measures to tackle ""organised begging"" and an increase in the penalty for selling blades to under 18s.

Harsher - but also lighter - sentences

Under the Government's Sentencing Bill, courts will be required to impose Whole Life Orders for cases where this is the current legal starting point - such as murder with sexual or sadistic conduct. However it does say there could be ""exceptional circumstances"" which mean this doesn't happen.

Rapists and serious sex offenders will have to serve every day of their sentences. But on the flip-side, the well document prison places shortage means there will be a ""presumption"" of a suspended sentence in cases where prison sentences would normally be less than a year.

People in this situation will serve their sentence ""in the community on requirements imposed by the court"".

New terrorism laws for large events

Organisers of events that attract more than 800 people - such as concerts and sport fixtures - will be legally required to take steps to prevent terror attacks. This follows the sickening attack on the Manchester Arena in 2017.

Those that fail to comply could face fines of more than £18million, the documents say. The Terrorism (Protection of Premises) Bill follows campaigning by the family of Manchester victim Martyn Hett.

Rules on releasing dangerous prisoners and Jade's Law

The Government's Victims and Prisoners Bill is set to give ministers ""greater oversight"" on the release of dangerous prisoners such as murderers, rapists and terrorists. It will create a new 'top-tier' of convicts who will be subject to a ""second check"".

The Bill will see parents convicted of killing the other person they have a child with from having parental responsibility. Known as Jade's Law, this is a response to the murder of Jade Ward by her former partner in 2021.

Other measures in the Bill include a ban of serious offenders marrying partners in prison and creating a new Independent Public Advocate (IPA) to work alongside victims of major incidents such as Hillsborough, the Manchester Arena attack and Grenfell Tower.

Continuing to drill for oil in the North Sea

Under the Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill , a North Sea oil and gas licensing round will be held every year. The Government has claimed this is necessary to enhance the UK's energy security and will help to protect more than 200,000 jobs in the industry, although it will not help lower bills for consumers.

It looks like it is being done for political reasons after Labour said it will stop handing out new exploration licences. It will require the North Sea Transition Authority to run an annual process inviting companies to apply for licenses.

Loosening rules on protecting your data

The Government says it plans to remove ""unnecessary paperwork"" and cut red tape in the way businesses protect personal data. It claims that by allowing businesses to take a more ""proportionate and practical"" approach it will save the economy £4.7billion over 10 years.

The proposed Data Protection and Digital Information Bill will also establish a ""framework"" for digital verification and bolster the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), documents state.

Clamping down on rip-off rickshaws in London

People who commute or visit central London will be well aware of the growing number of pedicabs. A new licensing regime will be brought in, and fare controls will be introduced.

It follows complaints of drivers charging a fortune for short journeys in tourist hotspots in the capital. The Bill would be in force in England and Wales, but will only apply in Greater London.

New Holocaust Memorial to finally be built

The Tories have previously promised that a Holocaust Memorial and Learning Centre will be built close to Parliament. Now the Holocaust Memorial Bill will ensure it gets the go-ahead in VIctoria Tower Gardens.

Documents say the new centre will ""serve as a powerful reminder to the whole nation of the Holocaust and its victims"".

Ban on live animal exports for slaughter

Under the Animal Welfare (Livestock Exports) Bill, the live export of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and horses will be banned. It will ensure animals are slaughtered in the UK in ""high welfare UK slaughterhouses"".

However there will be exceptions for breeding and competitions.

The actor and his wife Liz moved their family to a 120-acre site near the Peak District in 2020, where they are responsible for 100 sheep, 30 pigs and 10 horses

Former Emmerdale star Kelvin Fletcher has opened up on the ""accident"" that led him to become a sheep farmer in the wake of his exit from the ITV soap. The 39-year old departed the Dales in 2016 following a 20-year stint as Andy Sugden before going on to win the Strictly Come Dancing glitterball trophy alongside Oti Mabuse three years later.

Since then, however, the star, who is married to Cold Feet actress, Liz Fletcher (nee Marsland), swapped the Dales set for a 120-acre farm on the edge of the Peak District in 2020. That wasn't part of the plan, however, as Kelvin admitted the family had hoped to move to Los Angeles in a bid to take his career stateside - only for the Covid-19 pandemic to hit and change the course of their lives dramatically.

As lockdown hit, Kelvin, who shares Marnie, six, Milo, four, and one-year-old twin boys, Maximus and Mateusz with Liz, spotted a for sale sign, resulting in that ""accidental"" turn of events. The family are now responsible for 100 sheep, 30 pigs, 10 horses, six chickens, a cat and a dog.

Liz explained: ""It was Kelvin's idea. We had two children, no real responsibilities, they weren't at school, we had no jobs""¦ then all visas got stopped, but we were in the mindset for change. Kelvin saw this farm on Rightmove and said, 'Liz, what about buying this?'""

Kelvin added: ""We didn't do it because we wanted to be farmers. We wanted something different. We looked at all sorts of places but the thought of this quiet, idyllic life got us. Then, lo and behold, it's not as quiet as you thought. There are sheep, so you think, 'I'll get some more sheep.' Then it snowballs.""

Kelvin said a chat with a TV producer in January 2021 over ideas for new programmes ultimately led to the BBC's Kelvin's Big Farming Adventure series - which aired last year after he mentioned farming in passing. Asked whether there is any prospect of a return to Emmerdale in the future, meanwhile, Kelvin told Metro in 2021: ""Never say never!

""It's an incredible show, it's got an unbelievable fanbase, since I left it's gone from strength to strength""¦maybe that's a sign I should stay away! I've just finished a drama [The Teacher - with Sheridan Smith], I left to go and explore other things artistically and not only that, have a bit of adventure!""

The local community of Geraldine in Alabama, US, were stunned to discover their retired neighbour Hody Childress, 80, had been paying their pharmacy bills for over a decade

A kind-hearted farmer secretly paid his neighbour's pharmacy bills for years after learning families couldn't afford their bills.

Hody Childress, from Geraldine in Alabama, US, went into his local pharmacy over a decade ago and gave its owner Brooke Walker a $100 (£80) bill.

The retired US air force veteran asked her not to tell customers where the money came from and would return each month to Geraldine Drugs after hearing patients couldn't afford their medication.

Brooke revealed to the Washington Post: ""He said, ""˜Don't tell a soul where the money came from - if they ask, just tell them it's a blessing from the Lord.""

For the next 10 years, Hody would give the pharmacy hundreds of dollars without his family ever knowing what he was up to.

And for some it was a lifesaver with one person unable to cover their prescriptions due to the cost of health insurance.

Remarkably, nobody in the community had any idea their neighbour was paying for their prescriptions.

It wasn't until late last year his generosity was revealed after the pensioner couldn't get to the pharmacy due to his health conditions.

He was fighting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and had to find someone to give the money to on his behalf.

The 80-year-old was forced to ask his daughter Tania Nix, 58, to give the pharmacy his $100 bill.

His daughter carried out his request, she told the Washington Post: ""I was shocked - I had no idea that he was helping people at the drug store.

""He told me he'd been carrying a $100 bill to the pharmacist in Geraldine on the first of each month, and he didn't want to know who she'd helped with it - he just wanted to bless people with it.""

According to his daughter, Hody wanted to give back after he lost his son, Butch, in 1973 and his first wife, Peggy in 1999.

Hody died on January 1 and left behind second wife Martha Jo, two children, three stepchildren and 15 grandchildren.

Tania spoke at her dad's funeral where she revealed his generosity.

After hearing the news, the local community started to club together money to allow the fund to continue.

Heather Walker, a pharmacist at Geraldine Drugs, said if it wasn't for Hody's generosity some of the local residents wouldn't have survived.

She told WVTM: ""There are so many people in Geraldine who have lived longer because of Hody.

""Hody was a true humble servant who will always be loved.""

Carly and Adam Taylor have been hit with fresh allegations by residents near Leicestershire who claim the couple 'destroyed' two former quarries which were viewed as a 'personal New Forest'

Residents who live near the owners of Britain's ""wonkiest pub"" claim the couple has wreaked havoc elsewhere as they ""ripped down 20ft tall trees and destroyed wildlife"" near their village.

It comes as Carly Taylor, who lives with her husband Adam, in Lutterworth, Leicestershire, was hit with bombshell allegations after her company ATE Farms Ltd was named as the buyer of the pub which burned down in flames.

The property, named Crooked House, was the subject of a suspected attack by arsonists. Carly and Adam are said to have purchased it just days before the blaze, which police are investigating as arson.

The couple recently faced backlash from locals after they claimed they ""gutted a once thriving village pub within days of buying it"" in Willey, Warwickshire. Now, residents have slammed the pair for carrying out work on two former quarries before they submitted planning applications.

One resident, who is based in Dunton Basset, described the former quarry land as a ""mini personal New Forest"" with 20ft trees and wild orchids, reports MailOnline.

However, the idyllic land was reportedly destroyed after the Taylors purchased it. It has been reported that complaints were lodged against proposals to construct a 35-acre solar farm and 33 holiday lodges at the Slip Inn quarry, Dunton Bassett.

A resident told Harborough district council they objected to the plans and said the ""attitude to managing the countryside is wilfully dangerous and chaotic."" They added: ""The village was lucky to survive his [Mr Taylor's] carelessness.""

Solar farm plans, which are still being considered by the council, were submitted through ATE Farms Ltd. Proposals to develop a second site into equestrian, angling and leisure facilities came under fire from residents who claimed the plans caused the ""unnecessary"" destruction of woodland.

In public documents on the council website, one resident said: ""They went in with heavy machinery and destroyed the whole woodland."" Another said: ""I see he says 'sorry' in his new application. Words are easy, the damage is forever. How can you trust this applicant and what he puts forward?""

The plans have since been approved. Letting and real estate firm ATE Farms is registered to the same address as Himley Environmental, which runs a quarry and landfill site next to where The Crooked House once stood. Mr Taylor, 44, is said to be a shareholder and former director of Himley Environmental and is also reportedly a former director of ATE Farms Ltd.

Officers have 'spoken to' and 'continue to engage with' owners of the fire-hit boozer as part of Staffordshire Police's investigation into the blaze. South Staffordshire Council is also said to be looking into possible planning breaches after the pub was bulldozed without it being ""agreed or deemed necessary."" The leader of South Staffordshire Council, Cllr Roger Lees, met with West Midlands Mayor Andy Street yesterday to discuss the ongoing situation regarding the site of the Crooked House.

He said: ""We'd like to thank Andy Street and his team for their time in meeting with us yesterday and their full support for the approach being taken by South Staffordshire Council. Our officers continue to work to explore all options in relation to the building and planning breaches at the Crooked House.

""I want to assure all interested parties that this case is absolutely a key priority for our officers and we are committed to working in partnership with all relevant parties on this important matter. We urge people to stay away from the side and to allow the council, the police, and other agencies the space to focus on the important tasks in hand.""

Love Island's Jessie Wynter met and fell for Will Young as she entered the South African villa earlier this year, after staying with the farmer in the UK Jessie now has to return home to Australia

Love Island's Jessie Wynter has revealed she is returning home to Australia after shacking up with Will Young on his farm.

Australian beauty Jessie, 26, met and fell for farmer Will, 24, while in the Love Island villa in South Africa this year.

The pair's romance was somewhat of a rollercoaster while in the villa but the pair appeared to adjust well to life on TikTok star Will's farm as they've shared videos on their social media pages.

However, the pair are set to see a big change in their romance as Jessie revealed she's made a big decision on their romance and her future in the UK.

Jessie explained how her visa to stay in the UK comes to an end in May, which means she will need to jet back to her home turf and she hopes her farmer beau will tag along.

She said: ""I am looking to go back to Australia at the end of May because I think that's when my visa is until.

""Will might be coming with me, which is really exciting, and then we're going to look at what other types of visas I can have when I get back over here,"" she told The Sun.

Jessie added how she sees herself living in the UK ""long-term"" but that is only if her farmer boyfriend ""doesn't enjoy Australia too much"".

She added: ""Everyone I know from the UK has been saying Will's going to love Australia, so I'm concerned.""

The trip Down Under will also mean the farmer, who recently broke his silence on rumours of a feud with Casey and Tom, will get to spend time with Jessie's family, who she revealed are already big fans of Will.

""My family absolutely love and adore Will. He's so lovely to my brothers. He's the one who's initiating the phone calls, so it's really nice,"" Jessie told OK! magazine in a chat earlier this month.

Despite narrowly missing out on the final of the ITV2 dating show, Jessie and Will's romance has been going from strength.

Earlier this month the couple even discussed their plans to have kids and tie the knot someday.

In the recent chat with the magazine, Jessie said Will has been ""dropping hints"" about them starting a family.

She said: ""Will jokes about marriage and kids all the time. I don't know if he's serious and dropping hints, but we definitely do see each other being in each other's life for the long term.""

Last week, the couple celebrated Will's 24th birthday with a night out and marked the occasion with a string of loved-up pictures as Will gushed over his girlfriend.

As the farmer posted the snaps, which saw the pair making a toast before sharing a sweet kiss, Will revealed he rarely celebrates his birthday but this year was different.

He wrote in the caption: ""So I turned 24 yesterday. This was the first birthday since I can remember I didn't spend on the farm working.

""My birthday falls during lambing which is always a busy time, so I never celebrate my birthday, which is probably why I hate it.

""But this special girl took me out and made the whole day amazing! She's even taking me to Paris, how lucky am I. Thank you Jessie and I love you"".

Love Island's Will Young appeared to regret kissing bombshell Layla Al-Momani as Jessie Wynter pines for him in Casa Amore, a body language expert has said

Love Island's Will Young was in a state of stress and regret over his kiss with new bombshell Layla, says a body language expert.

Farmer Will, 23, seemed to be in a stable couple with Aussie Jessie Wynter, 26, saying he could picture himself falling in love, but in last night's episode passionately kissed Layla Al-Momani, 28.

It comes after the cast were split into two villas, with new guys joining the girls in Casa Amor, and gorgeous singletons sent in to meet the boys as well.

Soon after the kiss, Will said it made him realise how much he likes Jessie, while Layla told the girls about the snog in make-up room, and seemed very excited.

Body language expert Darren Stanton thinks Will showed anxiety over his actions.

Speaking on behalf of Betfair, Darren said: ""Will and Layla's interaction was completely different to the other Islanders. We have Layla, who appeared ecstatic over her kiss with Will, jumping up and down with her arms and telling the rest of the group.

""Meanwhile, Will's body language was the total opposite, as he appeared in a state of stress, anxiety and regret.

""While I don't think the pair will go the distance, they did share a super passionate and heartfelt kiss.

He went on: ""It definitely appears that Layla is very much more into the relationship than Will.""

The kiss will no doubt be a blow to Jessie, who, unlike Will, has not kissed anyone else, or shared a flirtation yet, but did share that she was worried about what was happening in the other villa, as she's insecure.

Before getting into bed in last night's episode, Will told the boys he felt bad about what happened.

Love Island fans were outraged by Will's cheating and predicted history would repeat itself as one tweeted: ""Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if Will sticks with Jessie and we'll have another Millie and Liam situation where Lillie revealed all at the recoupling #LoveIsland.""

Another echoed: ""This will be a repeat of Millie and Liam, Will will stick with Jesse and she will come back all happy and then the truth will come out #loveisland,"" and a third added: ""This is Liam and Millie all over Will is gonna do a madness only to stay with Jessie #loveisland.""

It comes amid reports that nine islanders were axed during the most recent recoupling, not yet aired, which saw the two villas come back together.

The highest number of Islanders ever kicked out in one dumping has been six but the shocking Casa Amor antics has led to nine Islanders being given their plane tickets home.

It''s been reported the savage recoupling will take place in Wednesday evening.

A source told The Sun: ""Reuniting the two villas was explosive - the recoupling will be a real shock. The tension was off the scale - viewers will be really surprised as to who choses who.""

The robotic scarecrows, known in Japan as the Monster Wolf, were initially used to stop wild animals intruding on farmland, but authorities are now buying their own to prevent bear attacks on people

Terrifying robot wolves with gleaming red eyes and bared fangs are being unleashed in Japan after a spate of bear attacks against elderly residents.

The mechanical contraptions were originally designed to act like robotic scarecrows and keep wild animals away from farms. But due to a rise in the number of bears attacking people, authorities are using the wolves to scare them away. The first use of the Monster Wolf was recorded in autumn 2020, according to the president of its manufacturer, Wolf Kamuy.

In recent months, local governments across Japan have started ordering their own Monster Wolves amid an alarming rise in bear attacks.

Officials say this is due to the mass exodus of young people from rural farming villages, leaving elderly people unprotected and the towns largely unpopulated.

Shinsuke Koike, a professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, explained: ""More and more, rural farmlands in the foothills that once acted as buffer zones between the bears and humans are disappearing."" As the villages are emptied, the bears have begun encroaching closer and closer in to areas inhabited by humans, where they have become accustomed to bright lights and the noises, and therefore less frightened of people.

In the past 60 years, there have been more than 150 bear attacks in Japan's northern region of Hokkaido, which is home to the ferocious brown bear. In 2021, officials recorded one of the deadliest years as four were killed and at least 10 injured in the region.. The rest of Japan is populated by the Asian black bear, which is less aggressive but still dangerous, and can be identified by its cream crescent chest marking.

The majority of bear-related attacks, sightings and other incidents are recorded in April as the creatures are driven by hunger when they rouse from their hibernation. Incidents are also seen in September and October when they consume huge quantities of food so they are plump enough to live off their fat for the winter months. ""But statistically if the number of attacks and injuries go up, chances of people dying will probably increase as well,"" said Mr Koike.

The one in 2,500 anomaly led to a mutant calf being born to a struggling heifer. Farmer Leslie Hunewill said: 'As it was dark, windy, and snowy, it wasn't immediately apparent that the calf had two heads, though it was evident that something was different'

A farmer was given the shock of her life when she foudn out by one of her cows was struggling to give birth - as it had a two-headed mutant calf struggling to be delivered.

The one in 2,500 anomaly baffled Leslie Hunewill who was watching over the cows at the family ranch in the US state of Nevada.

She noticed a heifer about to deliver its first calf but it soon became clear the animal was struggling.

Ms Hinewill, 38, said: ""Examining her, a head and the front legs were in the birth canal and the calf did not feel too large for the heifer to birth on her own, so it was puzzling why she was having difficulty.

""A lump or swelling was felt behind the head on one side, but when you're not expecting two heads, it's not something you would think would be there.""

What came out was shocking.

The farmer said: ""As it was dark, windy, and snowy, it wasn't immediately apparent that the calf had two heads, though it was evident that something was different.

""The calf's body was small - what we would expect with the bull this heifer was bred to - but the head seemed unusually large.

""It's hard to comprehend what you're seeing when you're not expecting what's in front of you!

""Even then, it took a minute to process - were those""¦ two heads?

""It was a bit shocking when it finally sank in that there was a two-headed calf laying out there. I kept watching the short video clip of it over and over.""

An experienced cow farmer, Leslie helps run the family ranches in Nevada and California, but even for her this was a first-time experience.

She said it happened in 0.039% of cow births - equivalent to one in 2,500.

""We have never had a birth like this that we know of,"" she said.

""It happens when an embryo tries to split into two separate embryos which would create identical twins, but the split never completed.

""It isn't something that is genetic, so I understand it's a rare occurrence - from what I can find, conjoined twins occur in roughly 0.039% of bovine births.

""My agriculture science teacher in high school had a stuffed and mounted two headed calf in the classroom - it was very old and moth eaten at that point, but interesting to see.

""I never expected to see one in my lifetime.""

Delivery itself was difficult due to the mutation.

Obstetrical chains were attached to the calf's front legs and, at first, it was pulled by hand with each contraction.

But it wasn't enough - and a calf jack was soon brought in for a stronger pull.

""It took two men to get the calf out,"" said Leslie.

Sadly the calf itself did not survive, but the farmers found a way to protect the mother from the pain of loss.

Ms Hunewill said: ""We had an orphaned calf that was being fed on a bottle so we grafted the orphan on to the mother and they were both very happy to have one another.

""She is a very attentive mother.""

Farmer Lee Wilson, in Kansas, surprised his wife on their 50th wedding anniversary by planting 1.2million sunflowers across an 80-acre field in a romantic gift

A devoted farmer has orchestrated a stunning surprise for his beloved wife on their momentous 50th wedding anniversary.

Lee Wilson, from Kansas, US, decided to create an unforgettable celebration by planting 1.2million sunflowers across an expansive 80-acre field.

The idea sprouted from Lee's desire to show his affection for his wife Renee in an extraordinary way. Together with the help of their son, he meticulously sowed the seeds of the sunflowers in secrecy during the month of May.

When the day of their golden anniversary arrived, Lee presented his wife with the affectionate gift. Overwhelmed with joy, Renee said in an interview with ABC Kake: ""It made me feel very special. It couldn't have been a more perfect anniversary gift than a field of sunflowers.""

The couple met in high school when they were 16 and have been together since. Lee said: ""Well we're celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary August 10th and you know what's a guy get his gal for the 50th?. And I put a lot of thought into it and she always liked sunflowers.""

Visitors from near and far flocked to the picturesque location to capture the vibrant beauty of the state flower in full bloom. A video clip of the romantic gesture has been posted across social media. One person commented on the video of Lee and Reene: ""How beautiful. She must feel very loved.""

Another added: ""That's so lovely and congratulations to them both whenever their anniversary was."" Someone else said:""Such a beautiful gesture. Exceptional.""

Kansas is often referred to as the ""Sunflower State"" due to the abundance of wild sunflowers that grow across its landscape. The sunflower season typically occurs during the late summer months, usually from late July to early September, although the exact timing can vary depending on weather conditions and planting schedules.

Besides their aesthetic appeal, sunflowers also play an essential role in supporting biodiversity. Their large flower heads attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, making them beneficial to the ecosystem.

Anyone wishing to visit Lee's sunflower field will have to be quick though - as generally, sunflowers are known for their relatively short blooming period, typically lasting from two to three weeks.

Increasing light pollution worldwide means looking up at the stars in the night's sky is becoming increasingly difficult for people who live in populated areas, according to experts

It's thick fog, and thinly-veiled disappointment on the moors as we stand shivering and twiddling our thumbs.

The cloudiest night in a long time, people keep saying, which is typical when I have travelled all the way to Exmoor National Park to see the stars.

Then, when I think all hope is lost, the curtain of clouds begins to clear and I gasp.

As a Londoner my sky is usually filled with the glare of street lamps and office blocks, but now it's a black velvet ocean flecked with sparkling stars.

Light pollution is increasing around the world, with a recent study finding it has risen by 10% every year since 2011.

For people in Exmoor, North Devon, however, the jewels of the sky still shine brightly because the national park is a Dark Sky Reserve; a protected place with minimal light pollution.

Guides Liz Cwilewicz and Gary Wright, of Moor Wild Experience, point out the constellations and planets.

Looking through the telescope there's Jupiter and its moons; Orion; the cloudy Nebula M42; the Plough; the Andromeda galaxy, and more.

Gary, 59, got into stargazing as a boy because his father was an engineer on NASA's Saturn V rocket. He says nights on Exmoor, which includes the Valley of Rocks, are never the same.

""It changes as the season progresses,"" he says. Even with some clouds it's nothing short of breathtaking.

""We've had people cry because they can see such clear skies and see planets that are so far away,"" says Liz, 32.

""They say, ""˜I can't see this in London or the outskirts of Birmingham'. It changes their life."" Looking up at stars is becoming increasingly less accessible for people in more populated areas.

Christopher Kyba, who led the study at GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences into light pollution, says: ""If a kid was born in a town where you could see 250 stars, by the time they turned 18 you'd only be able to see 100.""

There are many issues with light pollution not least wasted energy, which given the climate and economic crises should not be overlooked.

""When we look up at the sky glow and can't see stars, the first thing that ought to come to mind is someone has been wasting money and wasting energy,"" says Mr Kyba.

He also runs the ""Globe at Night"" Citizen Science Project to track the result of light pollution.

It also impacts ecosystems because animals and humans are conditioned to a cycle of night and day.

Robert Massey, deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, explains: ""People living in very brightly lit environments don't sleep as well and there are health consequences to that.

""Also there are insects and other wildlife that depend on that darkness and that rhythm of night and day.""

He insists this is why it is vital to have dark reserves such as Exmoor, North York Moors National Park and Brecon Beacons National park.

Mr Massey says: ""I would argue all our national parks should be dark spaces.""

Dan James, 42, rural enterprise manager at Exmoor National Park, adds: ""We've maintained the darkness so it kind of shows that designation and protection is worth it.""

But there is a fear light from satellites could also jeopardise dark reserves.

Mr Massey says since 2019 the number of satellites has risen from 2,000 to nearly 6,000 in Low Earth Orbit, 2,000km from the surface of the planet.

""We're in a situation where we might, by the end of the decade, have as many as 300,000 or 400,000 satellites,"" he adds.

""If we have that kind of number, it would look as though the sky was crawling with moving dots and light. I would say it's a loss of a cultural asset.

""I don't think it should just be private companies installing these systems that have the right to choose that for us.

""If you look at myths and legends all over the world, they refer to the night sky, and they imagine that kind of mythology projected into the sky that I think is incredibly undervalued.""

Mr Kyba adds: ""For nearly all of human history, when people would go outside at night they would be really confronted with this sky full of stars, this whole universe, the cosmos, on any clear night without a moon.

""A regular confrontation with something that causes intense reflection and makes us think about our place in the universe a little.""

Standing on the windy moor, toes numb from the cold, worries seep away.

Feeling as small as the glow from a far-off star but with a sense of infinite possibilities unfurling before me, if you live among bright lights I recommend stepping into darkness once in a while.

Storm Debi has seen a 'possible danger to life' warning put in place for parts of Ireland, with gusts of up to 80mph expected on Monday as schools have been told to stay shut

Schools in parts of Ireland have been asked to delay opening, as the Irish meteorological agency warned of a ""possible danger to life"" from Storm Debi.

Status red wind warnings will come into effect for Clare, east Galway and south Roscommon, Offaly and Westmeath on Monday. The red warning for Clare and parts of Galway and Roscommon is in place between 3am and 5am. The separate red warning for Offaly and Westmeath is between 5am and 7am.

People in these areas are warned of a ""potential danger to life"" during the storm. Separate warnings were earlier issued for the island of Ireland as Debi is forecast to bring heavy rain and strong winds. It comes after parts of the island were devastated by floods during intense rain from Storms Babet and Ciaran.

While a yellow warning applies to every county in the country, the majority of people are also living in areas where an orange warning applies due to the risk of ""severe and damaging gusts"" from Sunday night. Met Eireann says it will be ""very windy or stormy"" due to Storm Debi across the country, with heavy and a chance of embedded thunderstorms and hail.

It warned there is a possibility of localised flooding, hazardous driving conditions and fallen trees. The yellow warning for the entire country comes into effect from midnight and expires at 3pm on Monday. The more severe orange wind warning applies to 19 counties for a more concentrated period of damaging gusts between 2am and midday on Monday.

Forecasters warned of damage to exposed and vulnerable structures, dangerous travelling conditions, damage to power lines and disruption of services. The warning applies to the entire counties under the red warnings, as well as Carlow, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Longford, Louth, Meath, Wicklow, Cavan, Monaghan, Kerry, Limerick and Tipperary.

Ireland's National Emergency Co-ordination Group (NECG) advised schools and pre-schools in these counties to remain closed until 10am on Monday. Speaking after a meeting of the group, director for emergency management Keith Leonard said schools have been asked to delay opening in parts of the country.

Mr Leonard said: ""On the balance of risk and to ensure public safety, all schools and pre-schools are asked to remain closed until 10 o'clock tomorrow morning in the orange and the red areas."" Mr Leonard, the national director for fire and emergency management, said local authorities and response agencies have been preparing for the storm over the weekend.

He advised people to stay away from coastal areas as conditions will be ""extremely hazardous"". He also warned: ""People are advised to keep track of the Met Eireann weather forecast because those counties in red, orange could change at short notice."" Mr Leonard said people should expect lengthy delays across public transport and delays at ports and airports.

He added: ""Employers are asked to have some flexibility in relation to employees who have to travel to work tomorrow and if working from home is an option, that will be the preferred option for people tomorrow in the counties affected."" Mr Leonard said road users should be aware of the ""very hazardous and difficult conditions"" on Monday.

He said there will be a substantial number of downed trees and other debris during the ""serious winter storm with some dangerous features"". ""A very important message in relation to keeping your phone charged. There's going to be extensive electricity outages tomorrow, and your mobile phone is your link to the emergency services.""

Met Eireann's head forecaster said gusts of up 130 kilometres per hour (80 miles per hour) are expected in the red areas. ""We can expect some disruption with travel, some infrastructural issues such as power cables coming down."" Asked about issuing red wind warnings 12 hours before they are due to come into effect, Eoin Sherlock said the current system is ""very chaotic"" and very difficult to predict.

""We did give people a heads up yesterday, there was an advisory."" Mr Sherlock said the agency could not rule out further counties being put under a red weather warning for Storm Debi. However, he said: ""We're hopefully confident enough now that we've reached what we will be issuing."" Various marine advisories also apply to coastal waters, including a red warning for westerly winds reaching violent storm force 11 between 2am and 5am from Valentia to Loop Head to Slyne Head.

The UK Met Office has issued a yellow wind and rain warning for all of Northern Ireland on Monday. It said heavy rain and strong winds may bring disruption and flooding to parts of the region. It advised people to be aware that homes and businesses could be flooded and there could be disruption to bus, rail and air travel.

The agency also warned that fast-flowing or deep floodwater and flying debris could cause a danger to life Power cuts are also possible. The warning comes into effect at 3am on Monday and applies until 2pm.

It's hard for many to imagine Christmas taking place any other day than December 25, where people all around the world gather with their families, but apparently it hasn't always been that way

For many, Christmas Day, or December 25, is the most exciting day of the festive period - but it hasn't always been that way.

In the UK, advent calendars count down to Christmas Day for a reason. It's the day where families come together to swap presents, eat turkey, and spend time together. With its roots in religion, Christmas is the holiday which commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ - but it hasn't always been celebrated on that particular day.

For the first three centuries of the existence of Christianity, Jesus' birth date wasn't celebrated at all. In fact, Jesus' date of birth isn't actually mentioned in the Bible - not even the time of year. Instead, the most signifiant religious holiday was Epiphany, which commemorated the arrival of the Magi after Jesus' birth, which falls on January 6.

It wasn't until early in the Roman calendar, in AD 336, that the first official mention of December 25 as a holiday honouring Jesus' birthday first appeared. However, there are conflicting accounts of why this date came about.

The church in Rome began formally celebrating the date during the reign of emperor Constantine, and some have speculated whether the date was a political move so as to weaken the established pegan celebrations. It's thought he wanted the date to coincide with the existing festival honouring Saturn, the Roman god of agriculture, and Mithra, the Persian god of light.

A Roman Christian historian called Sextus Julius Africanus believed that Jesus was conceived on March 25, the same date he believed the world was created. Nine months later would result in Jesus being born on December 25.

However, the date of December 25 wasn't widely accepted in the Eastern Empire, who celebrated January 6 for another half a century. Christmas as we know it didn't become a major Christian festival until the ninth century.

Some scholars actually believe Jesus' actual birthday was closer to early spring, near Easter time, the holiday which commemorates his Resurrection. For example, in the Nativity story, the fact that shepherds and their sheep were present suggests a spring birth.

Another point surrounding Jesus' birth was that his parents Mary and Joseph commuted to Bethlehem for census, which apparently wouldn't have occurred in winter, because the turnout would have been too low.

And it turns out not everyone was aware that this was the case. One person took to X, formerly Twitter, to shared: ""This really was the first year I stopped and realised Jesus was not born on December 25""¦ someone just picked that date.""

Another shared: ""Me when [friend's name] tells me Jesus wasn't born on December 25th,"" followed by a shocked face.

A family near Folkestone, Kent, has been ordered to tear down their eco-friendly home because the council feels it doesn't fit in with the local landscape after planning permission was refused

A council has ordered a self-sustainable family to tear down their eco-friendly shipping container home.

Dan and Stacey Bond own land on the Hoad Meadow Alpaca Retreat near Folkestone in Kent but could soon be thrown out after the council took objection to a lack of planning permission.

Dan, 37, built the two-story home that included which boasts two bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom and a living room.

Folkestone and Hythe District Councillors say the family had no planning permission for the makeshift eco house and they must now tear it down.

But furious Dan has labelled the council's decision as ""insane.""

He said: ""What do the council want? Do they want to give us a house? It's just insane. We're trying to be eco-friendly, we're trying to be sustainable.

""Even if we did go on the housing list, we're not going to get a house. So we've tried to do our best and we can't afford anywhere else, so we've done this and this is what we've got.

""Within two weeks of moving in we had the planning enforcement officer at the gate asking exactly what we were doing.

""This is the right thing for me and my family and the best life for my daughter to be brought up in.""

The home was built out of recycled material and shipping containers and also has a pond, hot tub and solar panels to power it.

Dan and Stacey, 31, live with their four-year-old daughter Eva in the country home.

Their previous home was a converted double-decker bus.

The shipping container home cost around £40,000 to build, but was branded ""detrimental"" to the ""character and appearance of the countryside"" and the North Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The family, who grows their own food and keeps chickens. Alpacas, pigs, and goats also roam in the surrounding fields and tourists are invited to hire a luxurious bell tent - at £125 per night - or pitch their own tent on the farm for £25 a night.

Dan said: ""We've got a 40ft shipping container and a 20ft one on top. We've got two bedrooms, a kitchen and bathroom downstairs, and then the living room upstairs.

""Everything is upcycled. We try to avoid buying anything new because it's just not in the ethos of the place.

""There aren't enough houses as it is - we're fortunate we could get the land in the first place.

""I think there should be more opportunities out there for youngsters to work a sustainable life.""

Dan said the family applied in 2018 to build a ""subterranean eco-home"" on the land, but this was refused and the family was told it would be an ""unsustainable development in the countryside.""

Last week, Folkestone and Hythe District Councillors voted unanimously to approve planning officers' recommendations that enforcement action be taken against the family.

This is despite the land being close to the A260 between Folkestone and Canterbury.

He has also had trouble putting forward his case to the council due to the costs involved and his dyslexia.

They were given permission for the driveway, but are still facing their home being torn down.

""We've got our vegetable plots, we've got our meat, we've got everything here we're growing and producing, just trying to be as self-sufficient as we can.

""It's just such a nice place to bring up a four-year-old. It's just trying to do everything for you and for your family and give them the best. Something like this is just very unobtainable.

""We're not in masses of open countryside. It is a quiet little cul-de-sac - it's not out in the middle of nowhere. We have never got a handout for anything. We've done everything off our own backs - we've paid our way.

""Just because it's a bit alternative doesn't mean it's not right.""

A planning report stated: ""The residential and tourism uses are considered to constitute unsustainable development in the countryside, result in the loss of best and most versatile agricultural land and be detrimental to the character and appearance of the countryside and the North Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and Special Landscape Area.

""It has not been demonstrated that the uses would not result in harm to occupants of the site from contamination or that the additional overnight accommodation would not result in harm to internationally designated sites.

""The tourism use is also considered to be detrimental to the amenity of nearby residents.""

An enforcement notice has now been issued requiring the family to return the land to how it was and vacate within 12 months.

In a nod to Jeremy Clarkson's similar challenges in getting planning permission for his farm in the Cotswolds, Dan added: ""It certainly does chime; especially with the number of people against you when all you're trying to do is bring in people to a nice place, to view it and see it and all the rest of it.""

Dan says the family have launched a GoFundMe page to raise the necessary money to appeal the council's decision and not have to move from their home.

On his family now facing the perilous prospect of being made homeless, Dan added: ""Where do I put my family? My daughter goes to the school just down the road... We wouldn't have anywhere else to live.

""So what can we do? Are the council going to give us a house?

""I very much doubt it. They're the ones who are basically making us homeless.

""I don't know what we'd do. It's an unbearable thought, to be honest. It's very worrying.

""To uproot everything that you've put into it, it's unbearable.

""We were working on submitting plans for the glamping site and one the back of that would be the home, because you need to be there on the site.

""But the council were very sneaky... We were corresponding with them all the time, and if they would have given us a timescale we would have got our planning applications in.

""But we are not planning to give up any time soon.""

A Folkestone & Hythe District Council spokesperson said Mr Bond had first applied for planning permission to erect a dwelling on the site back in 2018, which was refused.

He subsequently constructed a biodiversity pond and hardstanding ""without planning permission"", which was then granted in December 2021 after he applied retrospectively.

At this stage, the council said he communicated through his agent that he only intended to use the land for agricultural purposes.

But he then ""moved onto the site, without planning permission, in approximately March/April 2022"", according to the local authority, and told a visiting council officer shortly afterwards that he would submit a retrospective application for planning permission for the new living structure.

The officer informed him that while it was ""likely that enforcement action would be taken"", a period of ""abeyance"" could be in place, effectively suspending a decision, if he submitted a planning application.

The Folkestone & Hythe District Council spokesperson said he had still not submitted an application a year later.

Explaining the council's decision to take planning enforcement action, they said: ""The site lies in the countryside, where national and local planning policies seek to restrict new residential development.

""The site also lies in the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Government planning policy states that ""˜great weight should be given to conserving and enhancing landscape and scenic beauty in""¦ areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which have the highest status of protection in relation to these issues'.

The spokesperson added that the enforcement notice has not yet been served, and that Mr Bond and his family would have a year to comply once it has.

He currently has the opportunity to appeal to the Planning Inspectorate, they said, who would reach a decision on whether or not to grant planning permission for the development and whether a year is a ""sufficient amount of time"" for him to complyall do

The WasteShark has been deployed in busy Canary Wharf, in London, and can travel up to 5km before needing to be recharged

A plastic-eating robot shark is being deployed into London's Canary Wharf in a bid to reduce water pollution in the area.

Ahead of Global Recycling Day on March 18, the WasteShark can collect up to 500kg of plastic waste - the equivalent of 22,700 plastic bottles - a day.

It will also gather microplastics and other pollutants as it makes its way through 5km of waterway before needing a recharge.

Once the plastic is collected, the aim is to recycle it for further use.

The machine is London's first marine robot designed to remove floating waste in the capital, and it can also collect data on water quality as it swims.

This WasteShark was created by Britvic-owned infused sparkling water brand, Aqua Libra, whose spokesman, Steve Potts, said: ""Ensuring packaging never becomes waste is a core part of our vision.

""We are excited to be bringing the brilliantly innovative technology to London in partnership with the team at Canary Wharf Group, to help tackle plastic pollution in this revolutionary way.""

Canary Wharf is one of London's busiest districts, with 120,000 people working, visiting, or shopping in the area daily.

But the Canary Wharf Group claims that in 2019 alone, 3,576,293 million pieces of single-use plastic were eliminated or recycled there.

Currently, only 14% of English rivers meet good ecological status, with pollution from agriculture, sewage, roads, and single-use plastics.

And it is estimated that eight million tonnes of plastic enter our oceans every year, much of it coming from cities through rivers.

The launch of the marine robot is the brand's next step on its mission to tackle the issue of plastic waste in London, which will hopefully encourage consumers to make small changes in their everyday lives to recycle more.

Sophie Goddard, director of sustainability, Canary Wharf Group, added: ""We aim to transform urban spaces into extraordinary environments which work for nature as well as people.

""As part of this, we are so pleased to be launching the WasteShark in partnership with Aqua Libra.

""This innovative marine technology will help us to tackle waste and maintain the environment.""

483,"Inside corner shop frozen in time since the day it opened 100 years ago","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/shop-opened-1923-looks-totally-29241748","Inside corner shop frozen in time since the day it opened 100 years ago

Moore and Toop opened first opened in 1923 and still looks largely the same as it did back then. But as it his its 100 year anniversary the owner is shutting up shop

A time-warp corner shop virtually unchanged since opening in 1923 will soon be closed in a moved described as the end of an era.

Moore and Toop opened first opened in 1923 and still looks largely the same as it did back then.

But Ernest Clothier, who became owner in 1969, has decided it's finally time to shut up shop and has put the property in Frome, Somerset up for sale.

Ernest, 77, said: ""Everybody's been saying, 'What are we going to do without you?'. Even people that don't shop here. But I'm creeping towards 80 and I want to retire. Time is time, isn't it?""

Moore and Toop sold agricultural supplies to farmers when it opened 100 years ago - and has not been repainted since.

The original owner - referred to as ""Mr Moore"" by Ernest - then stepped down in the late 1960s.

So Ernest and his late wife Mary took the job on.

Despite growing up on a farm, Ernest had plenty to learn and had the extra pressure of being under the watchful eye of Mr Moore for the first six weeks.

And he gave Ernest two options: perform well and the original 'Moore and Toop' shop-front sign could stay up, if not, it had to come down.

Thankfully, Ernest passed the test and the sign remained firmly in place for another 54 years.

Original advertising board from brands of the past remained on the walls throughout Ernest's tenancy.

They have since been taken for auction in Chippenham, Wilts., where they are expected to fetch as much as £600 a piece.

But, after becoming a staple of the town, Ernest has decided now is the time to retire and shut up shop as he ""creeps towards 80"".

He said: ""The business had already been established since 1902 but has been on this site since 1923.

""So it's been 100 years and never had any work, we didn't even think about it as we're so busy.

""On a Saturday my wife and I used to be so busy that we wouldn't even speak to each other, not even time for a quick cup of tea.

""I bought it through a friend who asked if I was looking to do something and he said he had a lovely business that would suit me to the ground.""

Ernest and his wife spent five decades supplying the local farming trade with seeds and supplies - with business booming up until the mid 1990s.

He said: ""We were so busy throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s that we didn't even think about making any changes to the shop.

""We ran it more or less completely on our own and we were very very busy selling to local farmers and cottagers.

""The farming industry started to change and business slowed down a bit.""

Ernest also sold dog food, something he says was one of his bestsellers, often shifting over 400 bags.

He said: ""We would often have 400 bags of stock, originally from Entwistles in Liverpool, and they would always sell.

""But as time went by, the biscuits kept changing hands to different brands and declined rapidly.

""Fifteen or 20 years ago I discovered Spratts were still selling dog food on the game meat side.""

Historic brands like Entwhistles and Spratts are just some of the old companies that took up advertising space on Ernest's walls.

The advertisements date from before World War Two and add to the historic feeling of the shop.

The shop is also home to original Avery weighing scales - which Ernest claims are better than their modern electric counterparts.

Asked if he ever though about modernising the place, Ernest said: ""Not really, we were so busy we didn't even think about.""

Ernest will continue trading until the planned handover of the property on Friday, February 24 - marking the end of the Moore and Toop era.

And he said: ""I don't think anyone would want to carry the business on. We've got a warehouse as well so you'd need more space to store feed. The end of era really.

""The gentleman that has bought the space said he just wants to make it better because it's never had any work on it - I'm not sure what he plans to do after.""

After 54 years of trading, Ernest said: ""I will miss the people without a doubt but I'm sure I'll see most of them, if not all of them.""

A dog owner in South Korea went looking for their missing hound and stumbled on a massive dog slaughter farm where 1,000 pooches had been left to starve

A man has been arrested after more than 1,000 dogs were found starving in his home in grim conditions.

Police responded to reports from a local who had stumbled upon the house in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province, the most populated area of South Korea.

The residents found the site while searching for their own dog which had gotten lost.

The suspect, a man in his 60s, is said to have confessed to recovering abandoned dogs before starving them to death.

However, according to animal rights campaigners, dog farmers paid him around 10,000 South Korean won (£6.42) to dispose of the animals when they passed their breeding age, or if they were unattractive to potential buyers.

A spokesperson for Care, an animal rights group, said the man has been charged with violating animal protection laws for agreeing to ""take care"" of the dogs for the measly sum.

According to the Korea Herald, he would lock the animals up and starve them to death.

In South Korea, people found guilty of abusing animals face a minimum three-year sentence or a 30million won (£19,264).

In local media broadcasts, the lifeless bodies of dogs could be seen in cages, sacks and rubber boxes in the grounds.

Activists from Care, who visited the scene, said there were some many canine corpses that they made multiple layers on the ground, on top of which more dogs were laid.

Four dogs survived the ordeal and were rescued, and are undergoing treatment at a vet. Two of them were left in critical condition.

The surviving animals were severely malnourished with some having a skin disease.

In Yangpyeong, the local government said the bodies of the dead dogs would be removed later this week.

Animal abuse cases rose from 69 to 914 in a nine-year period between 2010 and 2019.

According to the agriculture ministry's Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, incidents of animal abandonment also rose by around 40,000.

South Koreans have around six million pet dogs and 2.6million cats.

Over the border in North Korea, a luxury dog meat restaurant has been built in an exclusive area of Pyongyang after being approved by Kim Jong-Un who is pushing ""healthier eating"".

Occupying a prime river bank location, the ""˜Dog Meat Delicacy House' will be near the well-known Okryugwan noodle restaurant in Pyonyang.

It is believed that the opening of the restaurant and others similar that offer dog meat as a delicacy is part of a drive by the state to improve people's diets.

But it comes as Kim opened a major political conference dedicated to agriculture this week with claims that the country is facing a famine.

South Korean experts estimate that North Korea is short around one million tonnes of grain, 20% of its annual demand, after the pandemic disrupted both farming and imports from China.

A council cleaner last week discovered a tiny headless corpse washed up on a beach in Spain and authorities have now confirmed the baby girl had died in an attempted migrant crossing

A tiny baby whose headless and decomposing body was found on a Spanish beach is believed to have died in a migrant boat tragedy which also killed her parents, police believe.

The tiny body was discovered at the beach in the Costa Dorada resort of Roda de Bera on July 11. Initial estimates put the infant's age at around two or three before tests confirmed she was much younger when she died.

Spanish police have today confirmed the child had been identified and she was an eight-month-old baby who died on a migrant boat which capsized near to the Balearic Islands on April 6.

Fifteen people died in the tragedy, including her parents.

The Civil Guard said the wooden boat, called a patera in Spanish, had left Cherchel in Algeria on March 21 and had been at sea for 17 days when disaster struck.

Roda de Bera mayor Pere Virgili said after last Tuesday morning's grim discovery the child could have been on a migrant boat that sank in the Mediterranean.

He said: ""The hypothesis this baby's body is another one from the Mare Mortum off our beaches is on the table.""

He said the clothes the baby had on, which included a jacket, didn't point to her drowning in a typical beach accident.

Forensic experts concluded her body was in the water for between a fortnight and two months.

Her body was said to be missing a number of parts along with her head, and is understood to have been found in an advanced state of decomposition.

DNA tests had showed a match to her mum.

A council cleaner had made the grim find a week ago and alerted his bosses who called the police.

Civil Guard officers cordoned off the area and moved locals and holidaymakers to other areas of the sand before an investigating judge authorised the removal of the body.

It subsequently emerged the decomposed body had washed up on the beach the previous day, but had been ignored by passers-by who mistook it for a doll.

Roda de Bera is a 25-minute drive north of the Spanish east coast city of Tarragona.

The town, well-known thanks to its Roman arch, was mainly dedicated exclusively to agriculture until the second half of the 20th century when it became an important tourist spot on the Costa Dorada.

A spokesman for the Civil Guard said after the horrifying find: ""All we can confirm at the moment is that the body of a baby has been found at Roda de Bera beach in the province of Tarragona.

""The alarm was raised at 8.50am this morning. The matter is still under investigation.""

Info on the students' diagnoses has not been revealed, however many parents blame the in-school use of Ouija boards, also known as spirit or talking board which spells out messages in a mysterious way

A group of nearly 30 girls were rushed to hospital after playing with an Ouija board at a school in Colombia.

The 28 youngsters passed out while using the seance set at Galeras Educational Institution, in Pasto in the South of the country.

""There were 28 possible cases of anxiety in school students,"" said Hugo Torres, head of the Galeras Educational Institution in Galeras.

Info on the students' diagnoses has not been revealed, however many parents blame the in-school use of Ouija boards, also known as spirit or talking board which spells out messages in a mysterious way.

Created in the US in 1886, Ouija boards have become a fixture in occult lore due to their alleged ability to communicate with the dead and give paranormal activities to those who use them.

The girls reportedly suffered signs of fainting, anxiety and other symptoms at school before being admitted to hospital.

Mr Torres continued: ""Given the reported cases, a series of comments were unleashed on the community that, rather than helping to resolve the situation, led to confusion and an adverse environment for our work.

""The students were referred to the local municipal hospital according to protocols in place.

""Directors and teachers accompanied the students during the evaluation process.

""The respective parents and/or guardians were informed of the situation at the time.""

The school is waiting for the medical reports before providing an update on the incident.

Many parents believe the children have been using Ouija boards in class.

One mother who works in the hospital said she saw three or four children arrive after fainting.

She said: ""Parents, you have to move, investigate what's happening at school because our children cannot continue in this situation.

""Our children always have a good breakfast and it cannot be said that what's happening is due to lack of food.""

In November, another group of teenagers in Colombia also collapsed after reportedly using an Ouija board, with five taken to hospital, according to reports.

Teachers at the Agricultural Technical Institute in Hato are said to have found 11 students, aged 13 to 17, passed out in a corridor.

The teenagers were suffering from violent vomiting, abdominal pain and muscle spasms. While most were treated at a health centre nearby, five were taken to the Manuela BeltrÃ¡n Hospital.

Jose Pablo Toloza RondÃ³n, the mayor of Hato said: ""The children were passed out, at the time they were found they were short of breath and thick drool was coming out of their mouths.

""Others say that they consumed water from a container, others that they came from a pool and had been given something to eat.""

Nicola's Bulley's disappearance has been in headlines across the UK, and the case has brought back memories for the brother of a student who died in the area back in 1978

The family of a boy who died in a brook near where Nicola Bulley has gone missing have said they ""know her family's pain"".

Student Roger Jones was thrown into a fast-flowing brook that fed into the River Wyre in St Michael's on Wyre, Lancashire, back in 1978 following a motorcycle crash.

It was near the River Wyre that Nicola, 45, was last seen walking her beloved springer spaniel Willow on January 27.

Police launched an extensive search of the area and said their ""main working hypothesis"" was that she fell in a river but a body has not yet been found.

Nicola's disappearance has been in headlines across the UK since late January, and the case has brought back harrowing memories of the loss of the Jones family's youngest son.

Roger's brother Don Jones, who now lives in Caton, Lancashire, said: ""We feel so much for Nicola's family and friends. We know just what they must be going through"".

Roger was a pupil at the former Fulwood High School, where he was working to go to Myerscough College to study agriculture and follow his dream of becoming a farmer.

The 16-year-old had been returning home one night as a passenger on a friend's motorbike when they crashed into a car on a narrow bridge in Woodplumpton, near Preston.

The bike rider was badly injured and unconscious when emergency services arrived, and was unable to tell them he had a passenger.

It was 3am before police were alerted that someone was missing and returned to the bridge.

While a massive police search was launched, that included dog patrols, divers, and mounted police , Roger's body was not discovered until two months later, when it washed up on a sandbank at low tide seven miles from St Michael's, the town where Nicola was last seen.

Don, a journalist for Granada TV, said that his family were ""exhausted"" by the time his younger brother's body was found, adding: ""It was just a case of waiting for what seemed inevitable"".

He said that the river conditions when Roger went missing 45 years ago were ""pretty similar"" to the conditions Nicola may have faced in the River Wyre, adding: ""He was obviously swept over the weir and into the tidal part of the river.""

Don said that he and his family didn't have to deal with social media trolls and conspiracy theorists chiming in, adding that it ""must be a nightmare for [Nicola's family] to deal with"".

He added that he and his family also had to deal with ""clairvoyants and spiritualists"", which he said ""proved very upsetting, especially for our mum"".

Lancashire Police renewed their appeal for dashcam footage of St Michael's on the morning of Friday January 27 when Nicola was last seen at around 9.20am.

Sixty officers are working to locate the 45-year-old mortgage advisor, with the National Crime Agency on hand to review Lancashire Police's investigation to see if any clues slipped through the net.

Yesterday the county force again rejected suggestions that Nicola could have been a victim of crime, with detectives believing she has ""most likely"" fallen into the river.

488,"Bristol City star Abi Harrison sends return warning to WSL after ""best day of her life""","https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/bristol-city-abi-harrison-wsl-30861756","Bristol City star Abi Harrison sends return warning to WSL after ""best day of her life""

The Bristol City and Scotland striker sits down with the Mirror to discuss her return to the Women's Super League with the Vixens ahead of the 2023-24 season

The temptation is to label this a redemption story.

But let's be clear: Abi Harrison has not returned to the Women's Super League to redeem anything. The 25-year-old Bristol City striker isn't concerning herself with lost time and its recoupment. Neither is this about validation for a team bidding to confound football's status quo as one of two top-flight women's side without respective Premier League backing (Leicester City is the other).

Harrison has returned to the WSL with Bristol City Women after two seasons grafting outside the top-flight for nothing more than simple enjoyment.

""If that's your clichÃ© answer, then it is,"" the Scotland international tells the Mirror. ""We need to know our place, know our worth. We're not there to make up numbers. But if people think we need to redeem ourselves, if people think we're a write off from the start, that's on them. I've experienced the highs and lows of Bristol City in four and a half years. So first and foremost, I want to enjoy this.""

You can be forgiven for feeling that Harrison not wanting to tie anything grander to her hard-fought return to the top-flight can risk feeling underwhelming, or maybe even a tactical ruse.

City are the league's fresh underdogs. The squad -- a plucky medley of academy talent, hungry loanees and various experience -- is significantly less extravagant and well-known than those of rivals.

But speaking after another ""enjoyably hard"" pre-season training session under manager Lauren Smith, Harrison is in a particularly philosophical mood. The word legacy crops up more than once, prompting an ever-important reminder that Harrison, at 25 years old, is still technically young, a fact belied by her CV and the responsibility that has long sat upon her shoulders.

In Harrison's four and a half years in BS3, she has ""seen it all."" The short of it reads like a post-Covid women's football Bingo card: A move to the WSL. An ACL injury. A global pandemic. Relegation. Promotion.

The long of it is more complex. Harrison is one of only a few players to survive from the 2020-21 relegation season. It was a demotion that not only left the team and its history in the upper echelon of women's football in a precarious balance but also Harrison's WSL account blighted by what ifs.

Since relegation, Harrison has become the club's all-time top goalscorer and a centurion. She has seen the transition from ""not great facilities and home stadium"" to the sharing of the Robins High Performance Centre with the men's senior team and home matches at Ashton Gate.

Harrison's ambitions for this season, then, are necessarily heady, including a return to the Scotland national team ahead of the Nations League clash against England. She is more than conscious of the need to score goals, particularly more than her last WSL return of two during that onerous relegation season.

But where the former Celtic and Hibernian player vowed defiantly two years ago to reinstate Bristol City to the top-flight, upon doing so, the striker is less hung up on past or future promises now.

""There's an element of looking back on my career and not enjoying the moments enough,"" Harrison says. ""And don't get me wrong, I enjoyed that promotion. You can see the smile on my face now as I talk about it.

""But before I came here, I was watching a clip of Leah Williamson speaking about winning the (2022) Euros, and how you will constantly chase that feeling again, probably without ever being able to achieve it.

""So it's nice to look back, but I don't allow myself to get caught up in the moment because it's such a precious moment. And I think as a footballer, until you hang up your boots, you just go onto the next.""

Harrison's more placid character is in stark contrast to the iteration in April who, after City roared four goals past Charlton Athletic, was a cavorting image of catharsis in front of an adoring Ashton Gate fanbase.

Gleefully draped in a Scotland flag, the striker bellowed hoarsely into reporters' microphones that the day was in fact the best of her life.

That iteration of Harrison will return upon stepping out onto the Ashton Gate pitch against Leicester City later this month, a prospect that rouses a wild smile on her face. The return will be welcomed. Harrison's passion, while intense, is often critical to City's success.

""She gets the game, she's great to work with and she cares, so her emotions are sometimes on the top but I like that,"" head coach Smith said of Harrison earlier this season.

Harrison's vigour and versatility, along with the mutual respect between Smith and Harrison, has seen the latter deployed all over the pitch.

""I'm the sorest loser you will ever meet,"" Harrison says when asked about Smith's multi-use of her. ""Even if I'm playing as a striker, I'll do a last-man challenge, I'll keep the ball off the line. If she tells me to go into goal, I'll tell her she'll get the best out of me up top, but I won't argue. It's win or lose for me. If you don't win, there's no point in doing it.""

You can also watch the biggest clashes in boxing, UFC, WWE and the get exclusive action from MLB all for one payment every month. You can watch TNT Sports through BT, EE, Sky, and Virgin Media.

That mentality is paramount this season. Harrison and City are under no illusions of what awaits. The competitive landscape in the top-flight has changed dramatically since City's last season in it, but City too differ to the side relegated in 2020-21.

They are now a more cohesive unit, bolstered by a rough tenacity of youth, Smith's cleverness on the touchline and a mentality centred on the present, best embodied by their emotional bellwether up top.

""For us, the bare minimum is staying up,"" Harrison says.

""How we do that is how we do that. We can't control what other people are doing other than what we do in those 90 minutes, and that's our goal, being true to who we are.

""The size of club that Bristol City is, the history that we have as a women's side, we need to be ambitious. We need to stake our claim.

""We can't be ridiculous. It's going to be a challenge. But where we might lack in some things and finances, we make up for in other aspects.""

As another victim is mauled to death by an XL Bully, The Mirror takes a look at the sinister world in which innocent animals are turned into brutal killing machines in the name of making money

The UK has been plagued by a terrifying spate of XL Bully attacks in recent months, with a man in his 50s killed by an ""out of control"" XL Bully in Sunderland. A murder probe has been launched after neighbours told how paramedics fought to save the life of the man following the traumatic attack in Shiney Row at around 6.55pm yesterday. A woman found him on a field near Maple Terrace and shouted at the first police officer to arrive: ""Please help me! His throat is hanging out.""

Police have since arrested a 44-year-old man on suspicion of murder, while the dog was ""destroyed at the scene to ensure the safety of the public"". In recent years, extreme dog breeding has become big business and profit-driven breeders are continuing to put their wealth over animal welfare in order to cash in - with dealers earning up to £250k salaries. Devastatingly, this often means mating and selling untrained crossbreeds that have the power to kill. They are trained on treadmills and left alone in dark rooms in a bid to turn them into violent status symbols.

When not looked after properly, these poorly bred yet powerful dogs can attack other pets and people, as we've increasingly seen in recent times. Of the 10 fatal dog attacks in the UK last year, more than half of them involved the controversial American XL bully. It seems a cult has formed around bull breeds online, with an increasingly close relationship highlighted between organised crime and dog dealing. Careless and uneducated dealers are breeding dangerous dogs, and little is being done about it.

With American XL bullies making headlines after another viciously attacked an 11-year-old girl last month, and Home Secretary Suella Braverman pushing for an urgent ban on what looks like an uncontrollable breed, the Mirror takes a look into the depraved and dark world of dangerous backyard breeders...

Criminal gangs cashing in

Last year, a Mirror investigation found that new dog dealers were being encouraged to make ""monsters"" out of powerful dogs to earn up to £250,000. The RSPCA said it had seen animals kept in ""medieval"" conditions, with ""breeding bitches kept in darkness or living in their own faeces"" by money-grabbing breeders, making hundreds and thousands of pounds.

The dog breeding craze, which erupted during the pandemic, has caused the ""perfect storm for dog bites"". It prompted the arrival of pet 'fertility clinics', offering training on how to become a DIY breeder at home; and dog semen was found being posted with artificial insemination (AI) kits sent by post. Illegal ear cropping was also discovered being offered by crooks online, specifically to give XL bullies the American 'look'.

A gang from Stoke-on-Trent was jailed in 2022 after puppies were found in a semi-comatose state after cropping their ears. RSPCA chief vet Caroline Allen said at the time: ""Ear cropping has absolutely no positive effect on the dog themself and is done purely for cosmetic reasons because someone wants a specific 'tough' look for their dog. Sadly, it's a trend that, despite being illegal, seems to be growing in popularity.""

Ian Briggs, from the RSPCA's special operations unit, previously spoke out about the so-called cottage breeders ""churning out puppy after puppy after puppy and charging thousands with it with no real knowledge"". He explained: ""There are criminal gangs involved - certainly around the Bully XL market - that have obviously seen a way of coining in a huge amount of cash. They are operating outside the licensing rules.

""If you are looking at between £2,000 to £5,000 for a puppy and you get four puppies out of a dog, it's a lot of money. They are making hundreds of thousands of pounds. It's not just the XL Bullies though, there are the high value Frenchies too. It's all about turning over vast profits. But with the Bully XL if they bite you it is likely you will be seriously injured.""

Mr Briggs explained that the new market for puppy bull breeds has attracted a new wave of sellers that lack knowledge and care. ""What it's done is attract certain people to the breeding market that weren't there before because they can see so much money to be made. You can just see it coming. It's almost coming in slow motion, a tsunami of welfare issues,"" he said. He explained that these dodgy dealers are ""exploiting animals and the buyer for financial gain"".

Social media money craze

In recent years, the American XL bully business has been garnering popularity on social media platforms, with breeders swapping tips about how to 'market' your pack to make the maximum amount of money from puppies. In one YouTube video, viewers are told the UK is ""smashing"" the XL bully market and you can get puppies younger than eight weeks - which is against the advice of Lucy's Law in the UK.

A dealer online says: ""We've been in the bully game for over a year now and have got a bit of knowledge that we can guide you and help you on your way to raise monsters and make ker-ching."" His sidekick adds: ""Step One is picking your right stud, knowing what you are buying... do your research."" The dog dealers say that marketing is ""super important"" and ""it's all about status"" - rather than the welfare of the animal.

Sickening fighting pits

Dog fighting was banned along with all other animal fighting in 1835, and yet illegal dog fights have soared by almost a half since Covid, fuelled by a sickening stream of online videos. The RSPCA was called to 330 fights last year compared to 226 in 2019. And this year, numbers are on track to be even higher with 149 savage encounters recorded up to May.

The RSPCA runs stings to take down the violent and disturbing groups at the top level of this disgusting spectacle. The fights - some reported to be worth up to £50,000 - pit dog against dog until one dies or can no longer fight. They are said to attract heavy betting and guns and drugs are often found at the secret venues. Ian Muttitt, a chief inspector with the RSPCA, said earlier this year that technology now allows these fights to be organised easily and discreetly.

The charity believe backyard breeding and an explosion in demand for bully-type dogs is feeding lower-level fighting, such as chain contests in parks. And they say this is directly linked to the growing number of aggressive ""status"" dogs on the streets. Mr Muttitt said youngsters often start with an interest in ""status"" dogs and progress to the top levels of fighting. Coupled with the rising number of violent videos it was causing a ""perfect storm"".

He was also concerned about algorithms fuelling interest in fighting after it had been viewed once online. He advised: ""If you see a fight in a park or a public place contact the police and the RSPCA but do not get directly involved. Other tell-tale signs would be a lot of dogs coming and going from a property. If people are keeping dogs locked up and away from public view, or if people hear reports of dog fighting going on in their area, they can report things anonymously to Crimestoppers or to the RSPCA.""

Dog treadmills for training

Before pitting them against each other, dog breeders are forcing their dogs onto makeshift treadmills and forcing them to run for their life - training to either kill or be killed in the brutal fighting bloodsport. This hideous set-up was discovered in a raid this week, when the Mirror joined the RSPCA and police on the covert operation to take down a suspected dog fighting ring.

West Midlands Police said two men, aged 30 and 32, were arrested under section 8 of the Animal Welfare Act and five dogs were seized from a property in Saltley, Birmingham on Tuesday. Dogs, drugs and a machete were pulled from the house on a quiet residential road, and a huge medieval-type contraption was also wheeled onto the street.

As daylight broke, it became clear it was a dog treadmill. Such treadmills are commonly used to train fighting dogs, building both strength and stamina. A spokesperson for West Midlands Police said: ""Along with the dogs, officers found dog training equipment and books about dog breeding as well as a machete and a quantity of suspected Class A drugs.""

'Vicious' behavioural problems

American bullies and their variants can fetch as much as £6,000 on online marketplaces, and thousands of them are currently being listed across the UK for anybody to buy without checks. There are currently 1,303 American bully dogs and puppies for sale on Freeads, while on Pets4Homes, there are 866 puppies being sold. Meanwhile, on gumtree there are 85 XL Bullys available. Gumtree has noted the number of listings has decreased since the announcement of the ban.

Several people currently selling bully-type dogs online allude to the animals having behavioural problems. And while some sellers don't stipulate the breed, many use the term 'not good with kids' on the listing as a codeword for a bully. One owner selling her American bully 'urgently' for £300 on Freeads described her pup, which is just 10-months-old, as being already a ""big heavy boy"". She added: ""Unfortunately my boy wasn't the right choice for my family. A big hyper dog and three young children. This isn't what I want to do but it just isn't fair on him or the kids right now.""

Another, who had originally paid £6,000 for their pocket bully - a smaller version of the American bully, said she had listed the dog on Freeads for £1000 to £1,500 after it had a fight with her other dog. One dog listing in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, for a male 15-month-old American XL bully going for £850 said it was not neutered as the vet was unable to get him upstairs to sedate him. The owner added: ""Looking for an only-dog home as can be vicious towards other dogs, hence the reason for rehoming. My older boys are 10 and he's attacked both of them mainly over food. You will need to be able to handle him as he is strong.""

Animal behaviourist Zoe Willingham told the Mirror: ""We need to look at the reasons why these dogs have attacked. Unscrupulous breeders are breeding them to be guard dogs and having these aggressive tendencies. But then they are falling into family homes as pets, which is how you end up with this situation of people trying to sell them on because they can't control them and don't know what they are taking on and not seeking advice about how to look after these dogs or keep themselves safe.""

Joseph Rindsland, head of trust and safety at Gumtree, said: ""At Gumtree, nothing is more important to us than the safety of our users and the welfare of the animals listed on our site. We pride ourselves on being a responsible platform and as a member of the Pets Advertising Advisory Group (PAAG) - the UK's trade body covering online animal sales made up of 25 welfare organisations including the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Dogs Trust, and the RSPCA among others - we will always follow Government advice and legislation. Should the Home Office move forward with a ban, our dedicated safety team would make sure that it was reflected in our posting policies. In the meantime, we would ask that all our users seriously consider the characteristics of a dog, and their needs, before agreeing to rehome a pet. We have comprehensive educational material about different breeds on our site which we would strongly recommend users read carefully.""

A spokesperson for Pets4Homes said: ""Pets4Homes takes our commitment to the safe rehoming of pets seriously. We work with responsible and vetted breeders, provide detailed breed guidelines to those considering rehoming a dog, and work closely with authorities to ensure that we adhere to all UK laws. We do not feature breeds that Defra or PAAG (the Pet Advertising Advisory Group) have a recommendation against rehoming. Should the law or recommendations change on this specific breed, we will update our policies.""

Dangerous dog capital

Figures released last year by NHS England revealed that you are almost 10 times more likely to be bitten by a dog in Knowsley, Merseyside, than the rest of Britain. Doctors in the area see more than 24 people each year with dog bites, 60 percent higher than the national average of 15. Coined the country's 'dangerous dog capital', owners are claimed to parade their XL bullies around the park and use public spaces as illegal breeding grounds at night.

Locals speak of being too frightened to walk down the street, and of being wary of taking young children out for the day. In Knowsley, one resident, who wished to remain anonymous, described the number of dangerous dogs roaming her community, including Stadt Moers Park, as ""appalling"". She said: ""There's been at least four dog-on-dog attacks recently in this park. Only the other day a dog had its throat ripped out and was left with 500 stitches. It's a miracle it survived.

""This is my fear all the time. What scares me is that it could be a child next. It's macho-ism, it's young men who own these dogs. You have all these bullies going around, all these pitbull crosses, and they rule the roost, they do what they want to do."" The resident added: ""They have even been here breeding the dogs of a night.""

Resident Kathy Brogan, 71, said the situation made her reconsider where she can take her three-year-old grandson, Finn, and pet dog. She said: ""It makes us wary of where we walk. You do hear about dogs attacking kids and dogs attacking other dogs in Knowsley. There was a child attacked just the other day. We get a lot of people with powerful dogs, some of them off the lead, and it's frightening."" Less than five miles away, in St Helens, attacks average 19 per year. Two children have lost their lives.

One St Helens woman told of being attacked by a Rottweiler last year. The 47-year-old, who did not want to be named, said: ""The girl had to punch her own dog in the head several times to get it off me. It was trying to rip my arm off. I thought I was going to bleed out."" The woman, who had to have surgery, said she was haunted by physical and mental scars. She said: ""The number of powerful breeds in the area is scary. The scales are heavily tipped towards the larger breeds and I think it's incredibly irresponsible. I have no issue with specific breeds but know how to handle it if you are going to get one, don't put us all at risk.""

Danger Dogs - our demands

The Mirror is calling for these changes:

1. The overhaul of the Dangerous Dogs Act . An urgent review of the law is needed and tougher penalties should be considered.

2. Enforce the rules to stop the illegal and irresponsible breeding and selling of dogs.

3. A public information campaign to promote the importance of responsible dog ownership and the need for training.

Hailey and Justin Bieber met celebrity pal Jason Kennedy's newborn child and their parental instincts immediately kicked in, especially for the Rhode CEO who was dubbed a 'baby whisperer'

Hailey Bieber was dubbed a ""baby whisperer"" as she was pictured holding E! News presenter Jason Kennedy's newborn child.

The Rhode founder was joined by her husband Justin Bieber in meeting the young baby, but Hailey's maternal instincts seemed to have immediately kicked in as she confidently held the newborn. Jason shared the snap to his story, adding the caption: ""And the baby whisperer Auntie Hails.""

Jason's wife Lauren also shared a sweet snap of Hailey holding the couple's newborn child as she snuggled on the sofa next to their toddler. Hailey was all smiles as she was surrounded by the children.

The snaps come after Hailey and Justin fuelled rumours they were expecting their first child together over the summer. The couple were the subject of weeks of intense pregnancy speculation with some suggesting she's around 10 weeks pregnant.

Hailey seemingly confirmed the news with a strawberry-themed post on Instagram, with her loyal followers convinced she was revealing how far along she was, as a 10-week old foetus would be the size of a strawberry. She captioned the selfie: ""@maryphillips strawberry makeup,"" alongside a love heart and strawberry emoji.

Hailey looked gorgeous in the snap on her Instagram Stories, standing in a dimly-lit room wearing a strapless black dress, and finished off her look with a glossy pink lip and peach blush. Her post comes just after she shared a slideshow of shots on social media but failed to include a photo of her body, prompting her diehard fans to suggest she was hiding a baby bump.

""Are you pregnant?"" one person asked in the comments, as another added: ""She always crops her pics now. Hopefully for baby Bieber."" Hailey's strawberry theme has continued over the last few weeks, as she showed off her fruit-themed manicure, as well as pictures of strawberries on her Stories. ""The baby is the size of a strawberry since she's been on a strawberry kick for over a week,"" one fan suggested, however many are convinced her beauty line Rhode Skin is launching a strawberry-themed collection for summer.

Around the same time, Justin made an unexpected return to Instagram after taking a hiatus from the social media platform since May. Taking to his page, which has more than 292 million followers, Justin packed on a public display of affection with his doting wife Hailey Bieber. Posing with a toddler, the couple looked smitten as they sparked further pregnancy rumours while holding the little girl and gazing at her lovingly.

The island of Zanzibar off the coast of Tanzania in East Africa offers fabulous beaches, historic sights, scintillating spices - and a homage to Freddie Mercury

Zanzibar's Stone Town fish market is way too fascinating. I was so distracted by the mesmerising, colourful creatures for sale on the slabs I almost tripped over and landed on a swordfish.

Now that's going to be an interesting insurance claim.

It's just one of many memorable sights and experiences on this dazzling island, off the coast of Tanzania in East Africa.

Home to beautiful jungles, lively towns and white sandy beaches stretching for miles, it's an Indian Ocean tropical paradise with plenty to offer beyond fly-and-flop hotels - which are admirably suited to the job if that's all you want to do...

What to see

The UNESCO world heritage site of Stone Town is well worth spending a day in to discover its vibrant Indian, Arabic and African influences - and the horror of slavery.

Its mix of cultures is revealed through historic wooden doors on houses. Made from mahogany and brass, the beautifully crafted doors convey which families used to live there through their design.

Spiky studs meant the home was owned by an Indian family (the knobs are a throwback to anti-elephant defences in India), while chains sculpted into the frame of the door denoted rich slavers.

The Slave Market Memorial pays solemn tribute to the many thousands of Africans who were seized, separated from their families, beaten, sold to bidders at auction here and shipped abroad - with many dying on their appalling journeys overseas. An Anglican church now stands on what was one of the last slave markets in the world. It stopped operating in 1873 and still has the hole from the whipping post where slaves were hit to make them scream - a louder wail supposedly meant a strong spirit, so would attract a higher price.

Claustrophobic underground chambers where dozens of starving men, women and children would stand waiting for days until the next auction are a horrendous reminder of the trade. A tour of the former slave market site and memorial costs around £4.

A short walk away is the lively spice market, where powdered flavourings of every colour can be haggled over, and around the corner is that not-to-be-missed trip-hazard fish market.

Stone Town is the birthplace of Freddie Mercury, and the childhood home of the Queen frontman is now a museum dedicated to his remarkable life (freddiemercurymuseum.com, $10 for adults/$6 children).

The Old Fort, built in 1699 by Omani Arabs, is crumbling away but you can still access the battlements. A little art gallery filled with work from local artists was one of the gems I discovered up the stone steps there, plus market stalls selling wicker baskets, trinkets and souvenirs in the fort grounds. Well worth a look.

Back on the street under the beating sun, and vendors selling nuts and cold water were a welcome sight. You can spend hours strolling through the narrow streets, where cats snooze on the warm pavements and everyone is greeted with a cheery ""jambo!"" from the shopkeepers.

Leaving Stone Town for our hotel, we travelled through a gloriously lush landscape with towering coconut palms lining the roads and banana trees gently waving their leaves in the balmy breeze.

The island is known for its delicious fresh fruit, with juicy papaya, pineapple and ripe mango for sale from little wooden stalls along the road. Mango is coated with sugar, salt and chilli powder as a tasty snack.

Where to stay

My base was the luxurious Emerald Zanzibar Resort & Spa, a new five-star hotel complex at Muyuni Beach in Matemwe, on the north-east coast of the island.

Set amid 10 hectares of land, the deluxe all-inclusive property nestles between verdant jungle and the bath-like turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean.

The rooms are truly sumptuous. I was in a Garden Junior Suite on the ground floor with a balcony looking out over the tropical flowers and palm trees of the manicured grounds. An emperor-sized bed came equipped with a floor-to-ceiling mosquito net, which was pulled out as part of the hotel's evening turn-down service.

Meanwhile, the rainfall shower in the ensuite did the trick to rinse off sandy toes, helped by the hotel's luxury range of shampoo, conditioner and lemon verbena body wash.

A well-stocked minibar featuring local beers, and a Nespresso coffee machine to perk you up after the cocktails of the night before added to the luxe finishing touches.

It's hard to resist spending your time lazing around one of the four pools.

The quiet Garden Pool features a swim-up bar serving sparkling wine, fruity cocktails and a mean negroni. The gingerito is worth trying for a fiery twist on a classic mojito. Eventually, you'll want to leave those pools to visit the four incredible restaurants.

The Aqua offers a sumptuous buffet three times a day, with a dedicated wok station for noodle dishes, a fish grill for the catch of the day (the king fish, a type of mackerel drenched in lemon, is a must), a pasta bar, salad and dessert stand, plus a groaning bread station for all your carbohydrate needs.

For quick bites shaded from the sun while resting your feet on the sand, head to the Beach Club Grill, while the Brazilian-inspired Carnivorous Restaurant comes alive at night to turn out garlicky rock lobster, rare steaks and grilled chicken.

Try Le Asiatique for a live teppanyaki show, where the skilled chef flambÃ©s freshly caught prawns, chicken and rice mere inches from your eyebrows.

If you are not stuffed, top it off with a trip to the moreish gelateria.

When you're not eating or soaking up the sun, there are aquafit, beach volleyball and African dance classes to try your hand - and hips - at while working off some of those deliciously acquired calories.

A firm Balinese massage at the secluded spa will put paid to any aches and pains, while the tennis and padel courts are free to book for a pre-dinner game when the air is a little cooler.

The Emerald's staff are friendly, kind and eager to teach guests some Swahili. For example, ""maisha marefu"", which means ""long life"", is the correct way to say cheers to your drinking companions.

What to do

With a living coral reef - declared a marine conservation area - just a 15-minute boat ride from the beach, snorkelling is one of the best things to try outside of the resort.

The trip took us to the reef just off the private Mnemba Island (known locally as Bill Gates Island after the Microsoft billionaire stayed there) to duck beneath the waves and see the magical underwater world.

As well as coral, keep your eyes peeled for multicoloured parrot fish, stripy zebra fish, electric blue tang fish and even little orange and white ""˜Nemo' clown fish.

You can go further out in the boat to see dolphins skimming the surface of the water and playing in huge pods.

Back on dry land, the island of Zanzibar is famed for its spices. You can pay a visit to a spice farm to see crops of cloves (""˜king of the spices'), red, white, green and black pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.

Bring Tanzanian shillings or US dollars and make sure you stock up on the freshest kitchen cupboard staples you'll probably ever find.

As Freddie Mercury once famously said: ""I like to be surrounded by splendid things.""

Thank you, Zanzibar: you were truly splendid.

The threat of atomic warfare continues to feel scarily real in 2023 and the consequences would be devastating for our planet and its population if red buttons were pressed worldwide

With Russian president Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-un's continued penchant for missile launching, the threat of World War Three often seems scarily real.

And, with both regularly keen to flex their atomic potential, the menace of nuclear warfare is becoming a constant cause for concern too.

Should that ever happen, then the implications for the whole planet would be disastrous, with scientific research, dating back almost 40 years, suggesting our world would be plunged into a long, dark and cold nuclear winter.

Economical devastation on a seismic scale would be caused by the damaging after effects of the light, heat, blast and radiation from hundreds of nuclear explosions, according to the experts.

Early studies into the global impact of nuclear war, conducted between 40 and 50 years ago, speculated that significant volumes of dust kicked up into the air by nuclear blasts would block sunlight from reaching Earth and result in a temporary cooling of the air.

In 1983, the respected TTAPS study (named after the first initials of the surnames of its five authors) then first coined the term ""nuclear winter"", which it theorised would be a consequence of the many immense fireballs caused by exploding atomic warheads.

According to its findings, huge uncontrollable fires would break out across cities and forests, leading to engulfing plumes of smoke and soot that would form a thick band of black cloud encircling the Northern Hemisphere and block out all but a glimmer of the sun's light for several weeks.

Temperatures on earth would consequently drop by an estimated 11C to 22C - the equivalent of turning a hot summer's day into a cold winter morning at the extreme end of that scale.

Much of the planet's animal life and vegetation, meanwhile, would be destroyed, as per the scientific research into the ramifications of semi-darkness, deep frosts, subfreezing temperatures and rocketing radiation levels.

The large-scale destruction of food supplies and crops, as well as industrial, medical, and transportation infrastructures, would also, it is forecast, trigger a horrific death toll from starvation, exposure, and disease, with the global population plummeting in numbers.

Model, TV host and actress Melinda Messenger celebrates her 'powerful' fifties as she's tipped to join Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins and tackle high-altitude trek in Nepal to help school for deaf kids

It's 25 years since Melinda ­Messenger shot to fame as a glamour model after being ­spotted on a billboard ad for a windows firm in her home town.

The bubbly blonde went on to carve out a career as a TV host and actress. And now, at 51, she's opening a window onto a whole new world of challenges.The fighting fit mum-of-three is hotly tipped to be joining the next celebrity series of SAS: Who Dares Wins.

But right now her eyes are firmly fixed on tackling a tough test of endurance that will certainly push her beyond her comfort zone. And that's a high-altitude six-day 48-mile trek through mountainous Nepal, raising money to build a residential school for deaf children.

""Being in your 50s is such an important and powerful stage in life,"" says Melinda. ""And the challenge is to keep on growing and developing.

""You shouldn't stop when you get to a certain age. It's good to keep challenging yourself. As I have got older, I am much happier and I don't care what I look like if I fail.""

Melinda chose Nepal for her trek because she fell in love with the country 10 years ago when she visited her brother - who lives there - at Christmas. She has kept a close eye on the plight of the Nepalese people since the earthquake there in April 2015 - and despairs at the terrifying scenes now unfolding in Turkey and Syria.

""My heart goes out to them. I pray they receive assistance,"" she says. ""Nepal is such a beautiful place and the people who live there are so kind and generous.

""But after the earthquake in 2015, they needed funds so badly for a lot of things, including renovating a school for deaf children. I know it will help enhance their learning and give them the best possible start in life. I'm really motivated for this.""

Her trek is being organised by survival expert and expedition leader Dr Raj Joshi, who runs travel company Adventure Boutique. They recently climbed Snowdon together as part of preparation for the expedition through the Langtang Valley, close to the border with Tibet, which has altitudes of up to 12,600ft.

""Snowdon was tough and I was so pleased to get to the top. Now I plan to do more walks and am really looking forward to Nepal. To go with a group of people I've never met before will be such a unique experience. I know we will all encourage each other.""

Melinda has also stepped out of her comfort zone in other ways since entering her 50s - finding the confidence to allow her blonde locks to turn grey. She says: ""It was a natural evolution. I was about to film the Antiques Roadshow and I hadn't coloured my hair for ages. I noticed lots of greys but I really liked my natural hair colour. It felt cool.

""I started telling my daughter I should go and dye it for the TV appearance but she asked me, ""˜Why would you dye it if you like the colour of your hair?' That was when the penny dropped. I was only doing it because I felt I had to look a certain way. I ­realised she was right.""

When she's not preparing for her trek, Melinda, who trained as a psychotherapist in 2015, is helping clients. She says: ""It's a labour of love. It's very rewarding and I couldn't imagine doing anything else.

""It's so wonderful to be able to help support my clients. I have had 10 years of therapy for training. You have to learn everything about yourself. Life will tell you all about yourself - if you know how to listen.""

Melinda is still willing to dip her toes into the TV world when the right opportunity crops up.

She was in Celebrity Big Brother 2 in 2002 and starred in Dancing on Ice in 2010. She has been a host on Live from Studio Five and Cowboy Builders. She refuses to be drawn on rumours of joining SAS: Who Dares Wins - which could see her alongside shamed Tory minister Matt Hancock.

But she does reveal that she dreams of appearing on Strictly Come Dancing one day. ""I have no previous dance training and it terrifies me, but I would love to do it,"" she says.

""Anything that is a journey or involves finding out new things about yourself and overcoming them is what I love. I don't know how I would deal with my nerves. But then I am attracted to it because it's terrifying. I'm A Celebrity? No, I am not so pulled to that for some reason. But TV will always be a big part of my life. I've been doing it for 25 years now and I like things I feel are right for me.

""I remember when I did Dancing on Ice. I used to be so frightened before going out there. I thought I'd be humiliated but I did all right. I am really open to whatever adventures come my way. I don't want to shut myself away and I am not going to worry if I look like an idiot - that's part of the fun.""

She reveals her eldest son Morgan, 22, has turned down the chance of following in her footsteps to enjoy TV fame. ""He was asked if he would be interested in taking part in Love Island a few years ago, but he didn't want to do it,"" says Melinda.

""He told me, ""˜Mum, I am happy and I have got a girlfriend. I am not interested'. He has a personality TV would love. He works in sales and I think he would do well in the industry, but he is very much himself and doesn't feel any need to be anything but that.""

Her other children - Flynn, 20, and Evie, 19 - feel much the same as Morgan. ""My kids are more private than I am but they know what makes them happy,"" says Melinda.

""Flynn is very passionate about music and works as a landscape gardener and my daughter Evie is very interested in conservation and animal welfare. I will support them with whatever they want to do in life - but no, they don't want to follow in my footsteps.

""I guide and offer my thoughts but I am proud of them and at the end of the day, they must do what they think is right and lead their own lives. We are all very close and I feel very lucky because they are still living at home with me. It is lovely.""

Melinda says she is now happily single. She was married to Wayne Roberts for 14 years but divorced him in 2012 and went on to several other relationships. Her last known romance was with former Royal Marine Chris Harding who she met on Celebrity First Dates, but that ended after eight months in 2019.

She says: ""I am very happy. I have been in relationships since I was 18 and I really wanted a good solid chunk of time where it was just me. And I just had to think about my kids.""

Melinda's Nepal trek takes place from April 5 to 15. The trek is six days long with overnight stops at lodges and tea houses. Daily walking averages 5 to 6 hours. If you'd like to join her, email Adventure Boutique at contact@theadventureboutique.org

Love Island's Ollie Williams has popped the question to long-term girlfriend Laura Nofer after quitting the ITV2 show in South Africa after just three days in 2020

Love Island star Ollie Williams is engaged to the girlfriend he quit the show for in 2020.

The Cornish aristocrat, 26, left the villa in South Africa after just three days, citing his love for Laura Nofer as the reason why.

He's now popped the question to his long-term partner and looked delighted in a photo of the pair taken in Brown Willy, Cornwall.

Captioning the snap in which Laura's stunning sparkler can be seen, Ollie wrote: ""Strange things happen up on the moor"".

Fans of the professional hunter were quick to congratulate the couple, however one wondered if Ollie had proposed in the traditional way.

""Congratulations to you both...those knees look suspiciously clean though Ollie. Don't tell me you didn't get down on at least one of them,"" they quipped.

The aristocrat stunned fans in 2020 when he quit Love Island in record time.

After being initially coupled up with Paige Turley, who went on to win with Finnley Tapp, Ollie walked out of the villa before even getting a suntan.

At the time he said his 'heart had been elsewhere' and he quickly reunited with ex Laura when he returned home

But he also left the show amid mounting pressure on ITV bosses to remove him from the programme after pictures of him posing with dead animals came to light.

The snaps infuriated fans of the show, who launched a petition on Change.org demanding ITV remove Ollie.

Ollie was forced to deny claims he was a trophy hunting enthusiast, insisting he was actually passionate about nature.

However, he is now posting trophy photos proudly - upsetting many of his followers.

The Love Island star was blasted recently for posting a trophy hunt shot in which he poses with dead deer and a gun.

He's made no bones about his love of the 'sport', describing himself as a ""professional hunter"".

But fans were appalled when he shared a photo of himself with a huge rifle, sporting hunting gear crouched next to three dead Chinese Water Deer - the blood still on their fur.

Captioning the photo, he wrote: ""A fantastic morning with @paulchilderley on the Chinese Water Deer.

""They are prolific breeders with a hell of an appetite for seedling crops!

""5/6 for the Grand Slam, Sika to go!""

Replying to the post, one follower simply said: ""Disgusting"" while another shared a crying emoji.

A third quipped: ""Bet you're well proud"".

Police found children living alongside five dogs, believed to be XL Bullys, Cane Corsos and other bully breeds in poor conditions after responding to a report of animals fighting

A mum and her young children were left hiding in a single room after out-of-control dogs began a furious rampage around a house.

Police rushed to the scene in Sheffield on Saturday after receiving reports of three dogs fighting. They found five dogs, believed to be XL Bullys, Cane Corsos and other bully breeds, living alongside young children in poor conditions.

One person was left with minor injuries in the incident - though officers said the situation could easily have been worse.

The dogs, who were all ""significantly underweight"", were taken to police kennels. The children, including a baby, were safeguarded.

A 27-year-old was arrested on suspicion of animal cruelty and child neglect, and has since been released on police bail while investigations continue. Two of the dog's ears were found to have been illegally cropped, police said.

South Yorkshire Police's Operational Support Unit's Chief Inspector Emma Cheney said: ""We are not here to take dogs away from their families, we are not here to put dogs to sleep, we are here to protect people, especially those who cannot protect themselves, such as children. During this incident, it is believed that three of the dogs were aggressively fighting.

Do you agree with the government's decision to ban XL Bullies? Vote in our poll HERE to have your say.

""One person in the property suffered minor injuries, but the situation could have easily escalated and caused serious injury and even fatality. Of the dogs seized, two of them had their ears illegally cropped and enquiries into this will continue, alongside the overall investigation.

""Ear cropping is purely cosmetic to make dogs look more aggressive and fearful, it causes unnecessary pain and suffering to the animal and will not be tolerated in South Yorkshire. If you have concerns about dogs, or the safety of children in your neighbourhood, please get in touch. We always where possible will try and work with the owner, and put measures in place to protect those living, or visiting a property, but where necessary we will take enforcement action to protect people.""

The TV star, who has died at the age of 67, came from the most humble of beginnings before shooting to fame with his comic creation Lily Savage

Paul O'Grady tidied his blond locks and laughed as he pulled his Auntie Chrissie's trademark Marlene Dietrich pose.

His friend was in the bathroom and on the spur of the moment, Paul had tried on their wig - a random act of curiosity that would change his life.

Because in the mirror he didn't just see his reflection - but a revelation: He could become someone else - someone simply fabulous, even if just for an evening.

It was a few months later when in October 1978, that same working-class Catholic lad from Merseyside's Birkenhead donned a blonde wig again.

This time it was at an open mic session - at London's Black Cab pub, in Camden.

To the strains of Barbra Streisand's Nobody Makes a Pass At Me, a penniless Paul stepped out on stage in a second-hand black and white checked suit, an oversized hat adorned with pastic grapes swiped from his nursing home day job and a battered fox fur thrown over a shoulder.

Three minutes of lipsynching later, and Lily Savage - or as the compere had mistakenly called her, ""Lizzy Salvage"" - had finished her debut performance, to a ""decent smattering of applause"".

It was a humble beginning for what would become a 40-year career, a decade playing the country's clubs as one of the foremost drag queens and nearly 30 years as one of TV's best-loved entertainers, who even counted the Queen Consort, the late Dame Cilla Black and Sir Ian McKellen among his close friends.

""It's very strange which paths you take in life,"" Paul once remarked. ""And I've never had a game plan.""

Life certainly had plenty of plans for him though.

Born on June 14 1955, he was the the youngest of three, brought up in a rented three-bed home in the working class community of Tranmere. His Irish immigrant dad Paddy had changed his name from Grady to O'Grady after the RAF made a mistake on his paperwork. Paul's mum Molly Savage, a staunch Catholic, was a 39 when Paul made a somewhat ""surprise"" arrival.

""I was the last kick of a dying horse,"" he once quipped. ""A unexpected bonus or a curse, depending how well disposed my ma was feeling towards me that day. My mother didn't even realise she was pregnant until she went to the doctor compaining of indigestion.""

His father worked a number of jobs and their home had no central heating, was damp and has just two electric plug sockets. (A third one was installed as Paul's big 18th birthday present - a treat so he could plug in his record player.) However Paul's childhood was a happy one - which maybe explains why he was asked to step down as a choirboy for laughing too much.

He first became aware of his sexuality at secondary school after falling for a male classmate, but was still convinced he was bisexual for years afterwards, losing his virginity to a girl named Millie when he was 17 (the same night he was arrested for ""stealing"", or as he claimed borrowing, a bottle of booze from the pub where he worked).

Paul, who left school at 16, was also a regular on the Liverpool gay scene - but remained ""in the closet"" at home.

But just one week when he was 18, made all usual drama seem irrelevant. First his mum had had a heart attack, then so did his dad. His father died and his mother survived, then Paul's best friend Diane Jansen phoned to tell him she was pregnant - with his child.

""Having sowed my wild oats, I'd prayed for crop failure,"" Paul wrote in his second of five autobiographies, The Devil Rides Out. ""But the bloody crops had gone and flourished.""

He realised he couldn't marry Diane because of his sexuality - he'd finally ""picked a bus"" as he put it.

Paul worked a number of jobs to support mother and daughter, from doing the books in an abbatoir, to looking after disabled and abused children in a convalescence home, to going where the work was: London.

There, he became a live-in carer for Camden social services. ""If a single mother had to go to hospital, I'd move in and look after her kids so they didn't have to go into care,"" he once said. ""Often, there'd be a drunken father turning up at 2am, wanting to know who I was, and I'd say mincing slightly, ""˜I'm from Camden council!' and he'd smack me. So I'd be going around with a black eye and nits from the kids and scabies.""

His caring nature even spilled over into his personal life - in 1977 he agreed to a ""marriage of convenience"" with Portuguese lesbian friend Teresa Fernandes, so she could stay in the UK. (They only divorced in 2005, after Paul ""forgot"" he was married until his manager reminded him.)

It was around this time he befriended the Harlequeens [CORR]- the drag queen neighbours of the friends he was lodging with. It was their wig he first tried on, and them who introduced him to the then thriving scene.

Over the following years Paul straddled both worlds - keeping day jobs in the care industry, but working as part of a drag act duo touring the country for ""beer money"". In 1984, Lily got fed up of playing second fiddle to Paul.

While working as a part-time barman at Vauxhall's Elephant and Castle pub, Paul joked he would make a better drag night compere than the current stand-in they had. A week later his name was on the posters - and his catty callbacks made him so popular, he was poached by the famous Vauxhall Tavern.

""I said I'd do a few weeks,"" he remarked in The Devil Rides Out. ""I did eight years.""

It included one night when they were raided by police - in rubber gloves, because of the then AIDS and HIV epidemic.

Paul had seen enough of such prejudice - and famously quipped: ""Well, it looks like we've got help with the washing up"".

He also took Lily to the hospital wards.

""It hit us like a tsunami,"" he said of that time. ""Friends would be diagnosed HIV positive and within months they'd be ill and then probably dead. And there was no sympathy from anybody. I used to do shows on the wards. I'd dress up as Lily as a nurse. Imagine her with a trolley - and those plastic bottles you wee in? I'd rustle up some new, clean ones and have white wine in one and red in the other. These were people I knew who were dying - but you've got to keep a brave face.""

Soon crude, trampy Lily made the transition to Edinburgh Fringe, a live show at Hackney Empire, an Australian tour and then - the big prize - mainstream TV.

It started with acting roles in the likes of The Bill and a bit part in Daniel Day Lewis's 1993 film In the Name of the Father, but soon she fronted Top of The Pops, and in 1995 replaced Paula Yates on The Big Breakfast. By 1997, she was hosting Blankety Blank and after 2002, she hung up the wig, and let Paul - and his dog Buster - steal the show, beginning two long stints with The Paul O'Grady Show, numerous documentaries and, his beloved passion project, Paul O'Grady's For The Love of Dogs. A BAFTA and two National Television Awards later, Paul was still at the top of his game, having released a children's book and just this week been raving about playing Miss Hannigan in a touring production of Annie.

After losing his long-time love and manager Brendan Murphy aged 49 to brain cancer in 2005, Paul married former ballet dancer and boyfriend of 11 years, Andre Portasio in 2017.

In the last pages of his final book, ""A Country Life"", Paul, who walked Sharon down the aisle and doted on his two grandchildren, refected on his ""mortality"", having lost friends Cilla, Dale Winton and Mo Mowlam in the past few years.

""As you reach a certain age you do occasionally ponder matters of life and as you watch the autumn leaves turn brown and your friends and animals die off,"" he said. ""We must enjoy life while it lasts.""

But, like throughout his life, he could not resist a final quip, adding: ""Bugger me, I've turned into Peter Pan.""

Sadly this Birkenhead boy has reached the end of his story, long before his time.

As No10 battles to regain control, top Tories have been promoting conspiracy theories and making increasingly bizarre claims in a desperate attempt to get attention

It's all going really well.

As the next general election looms, Rishi Sunak had been desperately hoping to turn around his party's dire fortunes with a buoyant Conservative Party Conference. Instead, the annual gathering of Tory faithful has been derailed by speculation of the fate of the northern leg of the HS2 rail line.

As No10 battles to regain control, top Tories have been promoting conspiracy theories and making increasingly bizarre claims in a desperate attempt to get attention. Labour's Jonathan Reynolds said: ""I've never seen a Conference like this before. It's as if they are competing to say the silliest thing.""

Here are some of the most bizarre and sinister claims made by actual Government ministers.

1. Councils plotting to ration when you can go to the shops

Transport Secretary Mark Harper endorsed a conspiracy theory from the main conference stage that people's access to shops will be rationed. The top Tory ranted about the misuse of ""sinister"" 15-minute cities, a long-established town planning concept that aims to build communities where essential services are within walking distance.

Online conspiracy theories have proliferated about the idea, claiming 15-minute cities are a tool of population control to prevent people from leaving their homes. Mr Harper decided not only to use some of his speech to legitimise the idea but to announce government policy to crack down on it.

""I'm calling time on the misuse of so-called 15-minute cities,"" he said on Monday. ""There's nothing wrong with making sure people can walk or cycle to the shops or school. That's traditional town planning. What is sinister and what we shouldn't tolerate is the idea that local councils can decide how often you go to the shops and that they ration who uses the roads and when, and they police it all with CCTV."" There is no evidence councils are doing this.

2. Bendy bananas rules axed... again

Boris Johnson's favourite anti-EU argument reared its head again - bendy bananas. Environment Secretary Therese Coffey told delegates on Monday that rules regulating the curvature of the fruit will be dropped. ""Bent or straight"", it is not for the Government to decide ""the shape of bananas you want to eat"", she said. ""I just need to assure you that they are safe to eat.""

The EU Commission regulation was due to be stripped from the statute books by the end of the year. But the Government U-turned on its promised bonfire of EU rules, saying it would no longer repeal all retained EU law by the end of 2023.

3. Meat tax lies

A tongue-tied Claire Coutinho was confronted about making up a non-existent policy that Labour wants to introduce a tax on meat.

In a humiliating interview with Sky's Sophy Ridge, the Energy Secretary scrambled to explain a joke in her speech where she said: ""It's no wonder Labour seems so relaxed about taxing meat. Sir Keir Starmer doesn't eat it and Ed Miliband is clearly scarred by his encounter with a bacon sandwich.""

Asked if she wrote that, she said: ""I did actually write that. I think it's good to have a light moment in your speech."" But Ms Ridge pointed out: ""They're not proposing a meat tax, are they? I missed that.""

Ms Coutinho said her ""point is actually very serious"", claiming some of Labour's policies were ""incredibly hard for working families"". ""So you've got things like the Ulez expansion""¦ they've got things like proposing that you would decarbonize the electricity grid which would again result in very difficult choices for families,"" she went on. Ulez (Ultra-low emission zones) was introduced by Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London.

Ms Coutinho could not name a Labour proposal for a meat tax, with her only saying that ""talking about discouraging people from eating meat"" was part of the debate. Pressed on the incorrect claim in her speech, she said: ""When people tell you that they want to discourage you from eating meat, what they mean is a tax.""

Asked again where Keir Starmer had said that, a floundering Ms Coutinho rambled on: ""When they talk about moving at the pace that they're moving, what they're implying is that difficult choices will have to be made and we know from having carefully safeguarded this debate that when people talk about trying to do things faster and quicker, they do talk about things like discouraging people from eating meat.""

4. Renters are smoking weed

Rachel Maclean said there are ""plenty of young"" renters who are ""not weed-smoking bad people"" or in ""gangs and crack dens"" and ""smashing up the neighbourhood"".

The Housing Minister was attempting to explain to landlords why strengthening renters' rights could be defended. She said she was aware some landlords are worried about ""things going wrong and them not being able to get their property back"".

""A lot of people have said to me, 'Rachel, why are you doing this? It's not Conservative. There's going to be nobody, no Conservative voters are going to vote for this,'"" she said.

""And I say to them... I have got four children, all of whom are in their late 20s and 30s, they are all professionals, they are all earning, they all vote Conservative.""

She bizarrely added: ""There are plenty of young people who are in the PRS who are not weed-smoking bad people, you know, in gangs and, you know, crack dens and everything else... and smashing up the neighbourhood. There's lots of decent people, hard-working people in the PRS, and we need to do the right thing for them.""

While acknowledging landlords concerns, Ms Maclean told the event: ""One of the leading causes of homelessness in our country is no-fault evictions. And that is wrong.""

5. Fake meat is for astronauts

The Environment Secretary has said ""fake meat might be okay for astronauts"" but she is ""absolutely not going to tell anyone that they should not eat meat"".

Giving a speech from the main stage of the Tory Party conference, Therese Coffey said: ""We want farmers to have a fair deal and that is why we are regulating so that they get fair contracts. Our farmers produce the best food in the world to the highest animal welfare standards.

""But there's some green zealots who think our farmers should stop rearing livestock and instead we should eat fake meat. Regardless of what the zealots say, by the way, I'm being taken to court in relation to this right now, I'm absolutely not going to tell anyone that they should not eat meat.

""Fake meat might be okay for astronauts, but when people think of a meat feast, I want them to be thinking about great Welsh lamb, our Aberdeen Angus beef, our Saddleback pork, not some pizza topping.""

The 'wife-swapping' tradition has existed for centuries amongst the Himba people, an ancient tribe that lives in northern Namibia, southwest Africa, and is seen as an act of kindness

It is customary for husbands to offer up their wives to visitors in the Himba tribe.

The 'wife-swapping tradition' is known as 'okujepisa omukazendu', which simply means 'offering a wife to a guest', and has existed for centuries within the semi-nomadic tribe in northern Namibia, southwest Africa. As part of their culture, a husband can allow his wife to sleep with a male visitor, and it is deemed an act of kindness.

The tradition, which is regarded as ""completely different from the Western culture"", is said to show a 'warm welcome' to strangers and is considered to be a sign of friendship. The Himba people see it as a healthy outlet and believe it eliminates the kind of sexual jealousy that can affect more conventional marriages.

A documentary by African History TV explains the custom: ""For the Himba people, the husbands giving their wives to visitors to have sex with is considered the highest form of hospitality"". The video clip expresses that what is taboo in one place can be a 'welcome idea' in another, and draws a distinction between the marital and moral views of Westernised cultures and ancient African tribes like the Himba.

It continues: ""Among the Himba tribe, wife swapping is a tradition that has existed for centuries... even before civilisation. According to this age-old tradition, a man can allow his wife to sleep with any man who wants to spend the night in his home. While the visitor is spending a nice time with the wife, the husband is expected to spend the night in another room.""

The Himba tribe is estimated to be made up of 50,000 people and one small group, known as the OvaHimba, follows a very traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle that hasn't changed in tens of thousands of years, the Daily Star reports. Men in the tribe commonly have two wives, and genetic testing of one sample group shows that more than 70 percent of Himba tribesmen bring up at least one child that has been fathered by another man.

Women have great responsibilities among the Himba and tend to perform more labor-intensive work than men and boys, such as looking after livestock and maintaining the traditional red clay houses, as well as cooking, cleaning and childcare. Divorce is said to be very easy for Himba women and not at all uncommon. The documentary says: ""Births outside of marriages, or extra-marital affairs are not considered a big deal"".

But, this ancient way of life is said to be under threat, as Western influences spread through Namibia. One Himba man, Owen Kataparo, told the BBC : ""When I'm in traditional clothes outside the village, I get strange looks."" He says he's treated more seriously by outsiders if he wears Western-style clothes.

But many young Himba boys that seek a more modern way of life are disappointed. ""A lot of boys leave the village and go down into the town to try to find a job,"" he continues. ""Some of the boys find a job, some of the boys don't find a job, and then some of them decide to take alcohol. They end up abusing their life.""

Environment Secretary Therese Coffey shared a picture of herself standing next to the River Deben estuary in Suffolk. where bad weather meant the bank is covered in sludge

A Tory minister has been mocked after posing next to a muddy estuary - after it was designated an official ""wild swimming"" area.

Environment Secretary Therese Coffey shared a picture of herself standing next to the River Deben estuary in Suffolk.

It is one of four ""designated bathing sites"" announced by the Government, and comes amid widespread concerns about water pollution.

Bad weather in recent days means it doesn't look a spot that will appeal to many planning to take a dip, with the cabinet member photoed standing in front of sludge.

Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner couldn't resist having a pop, posting: ""Not taking a dip yourself?""

Comments were disabled on Ms Coffey's post, which read: ""4 new designated bathing sites confirmed today, including Waldringfield on the River Deben in Suffolk Coastal - the first estuary site.""

Comedy writer Adam Kay wrote: ""After you.""

And Nigel Pickover, former editor of the Eastern Daily Press newspaper, pointed out that the site is close to a creek where E coli was found, seemingly due to sewage.

He wrote: ""Isn't the Waldringfield site just a few swimming strokes downstream from the heavily-polluted Martlesham Creek with its huge E-Coli issues?""

Last week The Mirror reported that almost a million hours worth of sewage discharges occurred across coastal constituencie s last year, new figures have found.

The Labour Party analysed data from the Environment Agency (EA) which it says shows 141,777 sewage dumping events across 137 of a total of 139 coastal constituencies in England and Wales in 2022. It is the equivalent of an discharge once every three minutes and 45 seconds, adding up to a combined total of 980,999 hours, equivalent to more than 111 years.

Shadow environment secretary Jim McMahon said people who live by the coast ""should be able to just enjoy the place where they live without having to worry about encountering filthy raw sewage"".

He accused the Conservatives of allowing communities to be treated as ""open sewers"".

Today the Government announced three areas had been added the country's list of bathing waters.

These are Sykes Lane Bathing Beach, Rutland Water; Whitwell Creek, Rutland Water; Firestone Bay, Plymouth and the River Deben Estuary in Waldringfield.

Following a consultation the Government said: ""We acknowledge that any beach, lake or river is potentially hazardous for bathers.

""Bathing water monitoring measures the level of bacteria in the water but does not imply that the area is safer than any other water body.

""The objective of the regulations is to protect bathers' health by driving improvement to water quality. Water quality at bathing waters is monitored for intestinal enterococci and E. coli, which are faecal indicator organisms showing whether pollution from sewage, livestock or urban sources such as misconnected drains is present in the water.""

Storm Babet caused London's King's Cross station to close due to overcrowding as passengers were warned not to travel by rail on Saturday, and so crowd control measures were put in place

Key Events

A ""small handful"" of homes will still be without power on Sunday as around 100,000 customers were affected by power cuts due to Storm Babet - but a red weather warning meaning ""a danger to life"" has now been lifted.

Six people have been killed by the storm, which relentlessly battered the UK between Wednesday and Saturday. It brought travel chaos across the nation's railway networks on Saturday with crowd control measures implemented at London King's Cross station. Other lines were blocked due to damage to overhead electrical wires. Major incidents were, meanwhile, declared by authorities in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Suffolk due to rising water levels.

A rare red weather warning had been issued for parts of eastern Scotland but was lifted by around 6pm on Saturday. More than 300 flood warnings were in place at the severest point, but these were reduced as Saturday went on. Supply of power remains a concern, though, as Energy Network Association (ENA) said a ""small handful of homes"" face challenges, which continue from Saturday.

Ross Easton, from the ENA, said: ""99% of customers have been reconnected. With the exception of a small handful of homes where access remains challenging, all customers will be reconnected tonight. We'd like to thank customers for their patience and our engineering and customer service teams for their hard work.""

And a search continues in Aberdeenshire following a report of a man trapped in a vehicle in floodwater. Officials warned that river levels will ""continue to rise"", and said flooding from major rivers could continue until Tuesday.

But he was left stunned when he captured the soaked roads and motors that had been lost to the flooding.

Storm Babet causes 'intensely frustrating' diversion for Jet2 tourists

A couple's flight home from Cyprus was delayed and diverted in an ""intensely frustrating"" ordeal after a plane skidded off a runway at Leeds Bradford Airport.

Phil Casey, a golf journalist and his partner Ann Meredith, 51, were due to fly from Larnaca International Airport to Leeds at 11.20pm local time on Friday. Their plans were disrupted after heavy winds forced a Tui flight to skid off a runway, causing the Leeds travel hub's temporary closure.

Having cleared security, the couple's Jet2 flight was delayed and diverted to Manchester Airport, as Storm Babet caused chaos in the UK.

Their flight finally departed at 3.20am local time and arrived in Manchester at about 7am on Saturday, Mr Casey said. The ""very tired"" couple did not get home until about 8.15am.

Mr Casey, 49, of Leeds, said: ""Obviously it's intensely frustrating but at the same time you realise it's out of the control of the airlines, so we had a certain amount of sympathy.

""And then yeah, to make matters slightly worse at one point they put up that the gate was opening in five minutes. And then five minutes later when I went to check again it said 'gate now opening in 195 minutes', so obviously slight difference.
""So yeah, obviously we were then concerned about getting back from Manchester.""

Jet2 provided buses to transport people from Manchester to Leeds but the couple decided to fork out £88 on an Uber to get home sooner, he said. Leeds Bradford Airport has reopened but Tui customers who were due to travel from there on Saturday are being directed to Manchester Airport, the airline has said.

Journalist's 'strangest pic' sends social media into meltdown

This picture, taken by a BBC reporter, has amused social media users. It appears to show a couple enjoy a meal at an outdoor area of a restaurant - with water everywhere around them.

Latest on London King's Cross station's closure

London's King's Cross station has been forced to close due to overcrowding as passengers were warned not to travel by rail. Network Rail said crowd control measures had been put in place at King's Cross due to disruption to LNER services.
In a statement posted on X, formerly Twitter, Network Rail said: ""King's Cross Station is currently closed to manage passenger numbers on the concourse and on platforms.

""Storm Babet has brought severe disruption to the rail network and our teams are working hard to get passengers safely on the move.""

Storm Babet has battered the country and a rare red weather warning is still in place for parts of eastern Scotland.

Worst-hit area 'not out of the woods yet by a long shot'

The worst hit area in Scotland during Storm Babet is now an ""improving picture"", but there are still fears of further floods as a red danger to life weather warning remains in place.

People in up to 100 properties across Angus in East Scotland have been rescued from their flooded homes, with some airlifted out, a local authority official has said.

The alert for extreme rain during the storm now ends at 6pm, rather than midnight, and covers a smaller area than on Friday - solely Angus and Aberdeenshire.

People were rescued from between 80 to 100 homes across Angus, while residents were airlifted out of homes via helicopter in Bridge of Dun. No one is now thought to be stranded.

Jacqui Semple, head of risk, resilience and safety for Angus Council, said: ""Fortunately the Met Office update and our Sepa update this morning is showing that we have an improving picture and the red warnings and our amber warnings they have been reduced in timescales to 6pm.

""So that means we are looking at definite improvements in our river levels. We're not out of the woods by a long shot. There's still a lot of rain to come through, but less so, and there is still a lot of water lying right across Angus. Lots of water in the upper catchments that will still have to come down into our rivers.""

Major rivers could be flooded until Tuesday, officials warn

The Environment Agency has warned flooding is likely to continue in areas near major rivers until Tuesday.

Katharine Smith, flood duty manager at the agency, said: ""Following persistent, heavy rain from Storm Babet, severe river flooding impacts are probable in parts of the East Midlands and South Yorkshire today (Saturday) and into Sunday.

""Severe river flooding impacts are occurring on the River Derwent in Derby, where we have issued severe flood warnings, and significant impacts are also possible elsewhere across the Midlands and parts of northern England today.

""Ongoing flooding is probable on some larger rivers including the Severn, Ouse and Trent through to Tuesday.

""Environment Agency teams are out on the ground and have operated flood barriers and storage areas. Temporary defences, including pumps and barriers, have been deployed to minimise the impact of flooding where needed. Flood gates have also been closed in affected areas.

""We also advise people to stay away from swollen rivers and urge people not to drive through flood water as just 30cm of flowing water is enough to move your car.""

Met Office says higher rainfall is 'in part due to climate change'

Met Office meterologist Rachel Ayers told Sky News: ""We are seeing more days of 50mm or more rainfall recorded in the UK in the last three months of the year.

""It's in part due to the fact that as our climate is warming there's more moisture that can be held in warmer air, so that's 7 percent more koisture for every 1C of warming that we see.

""So it does look like we are seeing more rainfall and we do expect that to be a trend as we see the climate change continuing.""

Overcrowded King's Cross station closed as storm brings 'severe disruption'

London's King's Cross station has been closed due to overcrowding as Storm Babet causes travel chaos.

It tweeted: ""King's Cross station is currently closed to manage passenger numbers on the concourse and on platforms.

People in up to 100 flooded homes rescued across Angus

People in up to 100 homes across Angus in East Scotland have been rescued from their flooded homes, with some airlifted out, a local authority official has said.

Jacqui Semple, head of risk, resilience and safety for Angus Council, said people were rescued from between 80 to 100 homes across the region.

In Bridge of Dun, residents were airlifted out via helicopter, while in other areas those stranded were rescued by boats, including canoes. No one is now thought to be stranded.

Ms Semple praised the response from those in Angus and elsewhere, saying offers of accommodation have come from the local area and further afield.

She said: ""Fortunately the Met Office update and our Sepa update this morning is showing that we have an improving picture and the red warnings and our amber warnings they have been reduced in timescales to 6pm. So that means we are looking at definite improvements in our river levels.

RSPCA issues flood advice as storm batters the UK

The RSPCA is urgently calling on animal owners to keep their pets, livestock and wildlife safe during Storm Babet.

The charity has water rescue teams on standby and are currenly monitoring Derbyshire, which is under a severe flood warning, as well as Greater Manchester.

RSPCA inspectorate commissioner Dermot Murphy said: “It’s really important we help our animal friends get through this spell of bad weather, which is leading to widespread flooding. We have lots of helpful advice and tips available for people to make sure their pets and local wildlife are kept safe.

“In areas affected by flooding owners should be looking to bring small animals inside and move them upstairs, while livestock should be taken up to higher ground with enough emergency supplies for their needs. If householders do have to leave animals behind when they evacuate properties then they should keep them inside an upstairs room with plenty of food and water.

“Wild animals can also struggle in stormy weather but people can help them too. For example, they could leave some extra food out for hungry birds above ground level and perhaps even provide shelter for ground-nesting birds.""

Seafront pub flooded as Storm Babet sends wave crashing through window

""Pray we dry out and can welcome you all back ASAP.""

Teen dies after car crash 'in horrendous weather conditions'

A teenage driver died and five others were left injured after a car hit a wall in West Yorkshire last night.

The treacherous weather conditions are said to have been a factor in the crash near Halifax, according to The Sun.

A spokesperson for West Yorkshire Police said: ""At 11.17pm last night, police were called to reports of a collision on Brow Lane, Shelf.

""A white Seat Ibiza was travelling down Brow Lane, towards Low Bentley, when it collided with a wall. The driver, a 19-year-old man, was pronounced dead at the scene. An 18-year-old man was taken to hospital in a critical condition, thought to be life threatening at this time.

""Four other passengers in the vehicle at the time of the collision suffered injuries not believed to be life threatening. All were taken to hospital for medical treatment.

Danger to life flood warning in Wales as 'defences overtopping'

A severe flood warning - meaning a danger to life - has been issued for a village in Powys as Storm Babet continues.

The warning, issued by Natural Resources Wales on Saturday morning, covers the River Severn in the Llandrinio area. It covers the village of Llandrinio as well as isolated properties in the Severn-Vyrnwy confluence area including Hendre Lane, Haughton and Haimwood.

Natural Resources Wales warned that ""local flood defences are overtopping"" and said a number of roads could be affected by flooding.

It said: ""We urge people to take warnings seriously and make arrangements to be safe. Avoid travelling where possible and do not drive or walk through flood waters.""

""¼ï¸ Important Message ""¼ï¸

Roads within North Powys remain closed due to flooding and even though water levels may have dropped in some areas there is still the potential for hazards to be present.

Please do not ignore road closed signs and flood signs placed out for your safety.

Coastguards issue warning as hundreds of flood warnings in place

New Year's Eve fireworks in Scarborough were cancelled so that they did not disturb the unexpected visitor who attracted huge crowds to the harbour

An Arctic walrus named 'Thor' was heading back to the Arctic Circle today - after a weekend break in Scarborough.

New Year's Eve fireworks in the seaside town were cancelled so that they did not disturb the unexpected visitor who attracted huge crowds to the harbour.

It was the first time in living memory the species had visited Yorkshire, and the giant marine mammal was kept safe by animal welfare charities.

The RSPCA's national wildlife co-ordinator Geoff Edmond, who lives in Scarborough, told how Thor had made his way from Southampton after being spotted there on December 11.

He said: ""We are not sure where he has been in between - who knows? But he decided to come to Scarborough for the weekend.

""Now he is swimming back in the right direction and heading to the Arctic Circle.""

Scarborough Sealife Centre marine expert Todd German said there had only been around 40 sightings of the species in the UK in the past 140 years.

""It was special to see one here,"" he added. ""We will probably never see one in Scarborough again. People were so respectful, the general public were really caring, demonstrating our love of animals as a nation.""

It is believed that the young walrus could have come from as far as Canada. Walruses are extremely rare in the UK, though two others - Wally and Freya - have been recorded off British shores in the last two years.

It is feared that the bizarre appearances off our shores may have resulted from climate change.

The New Year's Eve fireworks in Scarborough were cancelled over fears they ""could cause distress"" after Thor was spotted late on Friday night. He left on Sunday afternoon.

Council leader Steve Siddons was disappointed but said ""the welfare of the walrus has to take precedence"". The decision was taken after advice from the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR).

A cordon was put in place after huge crowds of sightseers turned up. A BDMLR spokesman said: ""We welcome the decision to call off the fireworks but understand that some people will be disappointed that the display isn't going ahead.

""It is extremely rare that an Arctic walrus should come ashore on the Yorkshire coast. The creature needs time to rest and recuperate before it continues its journey.""

After a number of drownings in recent weeks as people taking a cooling dip in the heatwave got into difficulties in the water, here are tips on what to do in the eventuality

Swimmers considering taking a dip to cool off in the scorching heatwave temperatures have been given advice on what to do if they get into difficulties.

It can be almost impossible to ignore the sea, rivers or other open water sources with the sun beating down and the urge to cool off gets too much.

However a combination of cold water and panic can leave swimmers in trouble when they enter the water on a hot day.

This week a 15-year-old girl died after getting into difficulty in the water in a village's annual duck race.

In an update early this morning police said the teenager had sadly died.

Officers said: ""A teenage girl has sadly died following a search in water near Hodge Lane, Broadbottom.""

The RNLI says if anyone finds themselves in trouble while taking a dip they should float on their back and try to relax.

Remaining calm while floating is extremely important as to not tire out and to try to think clearly until help arrives.

RNLI Water Safety Manager Sam Johnson offered advice to those taking a trip to the beach.

He said: ""Our main advice is to visit a lifeguarded beach and swim between the red and yellow flags.

""Children should be supervised at all times and people of all ages should avoid swimming alone.

""We want people to enjoy the coast but urge everyone to respect the water, think about their own safety and know what to do in an emergency.""

The Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS) warned people looking to take a dip in open water to ""stay out, unless supervised"".

So far this year 14 people have died in waters in and around the UK.

Open water swimming safety tips

Get to know where you are swimming and check the condition before going in.

Make sure you are properly equipped.

Beware of the cold.

Make sure someone knows where you have gone and why, and that you have the means to call for help, especially in remote locations.

Take note of local safety advice and respect the countryside, landowners and other users.

Locations to be particularly cautious about include

quarries and reservoirs, which can be deceptively deep and cold throughout the year.

rivers with features such as weirs and fast flowing water.

potentially polluted locations near to rainwater run-offs, livestock and estuarial waters.

Erik Torres has been fined by Miami-Dade County for dyeing his puppy red and yellow to look like the Pokemon character after images of the dog at a basketball game went viral and sparked outrage

A dog owner has been fined for dyeing his puppy red and yellow so as to look like the popular Pokemon character Pikachu.

Video footage of the animal went viral after the owner, Erik Torres, proudly showed off his pet at a Miami Heat basketball game.

The dog, named Zaza, caught the attention of a commentator, who concluded: ""I don't think that dog signed off on that paint job,"" reported the Daily Star.

While the owner may have been having a joke, many have pointed out that his antics could have caused distress to the dog and it led to him being fined $200 (around £165) by Miami-Dade County in the United States.

The law states that it's illegal to be in possession of any dyed or artificially coloured animal.

In response to the public response, he revealed that he didn't dye the dog himself, but instead sent the pet to California to surprise his daughter, who loves Pokemon.

He claimed that he underwent intense research before allowing the hair dyeing to take place and was completely unaware that he had done anything illegal.

""Puppies are very delicate. They do tend to have very low immune systems as they develop and so it's the nature of the business that dogs do get sick,"" Torres told NBCMiami.com, but added that the dye was safe enough to even eat.

Torres, who owns the 'World Famous Puppies' pet store, in Doral, Florida, has reportedly had previous issues with the law.

Since the shop's opening in 2021, Miami-Dade Animal Services have issued 16 citations, most of which have come from customer complaints about sick dogs.

But Torres adamantly denies any wrongdoing, claiming he does what he can to keep the animals in good health.

Miami-Dade Animal Services spotted Zaza during an inspection on December 21, 2022.

Kathleen Labrada, assistant director of Miami-Dade Animal Services, claimed: ""Pikachu was in the store. There was a staff member holding the dog in her lap. We obtained a photograph at that time.""

She said it is: ""unlawful for any person to possess, sell or otherwise transfer within the County any dyed or artificially coloured rabbit or other animal.""

One week after the initial inspection, County authorities informed Torres that they would be issuing a citation.

But despite the negative press, Torres stands by his actions.

He claimed: ""We live in a free country, and if they feel a certain type of way, they can go ahead and do research, just the same way I did, and understand what happened and where this dye came from.""

He added that the dye should grow out in half a year.

Despite the controversy, a Miami-Dade spokesperson told NBC Miami that they have no intention of removing Zaza from her owner.

Meghan Markle was spotted out and about without her husband Prince Harry, which came as she she allegedly broke a rule at her local farmers' market with her beagle

Meghan Markle allegedly broke a rule when she visited her local farmers' market on Friday, as per reports.

The Duchess of Sussex was seen out and about soaking up the Californian sunshine at the Santa Barbara Certified Farmers Market before the weekend. Without Prince Harry by her side, Meghan could be seen wandering the market and browsing the fresh goods that were on offer.

But as per one report, Meghan is said to have broken a rule that the market has. While at the market, she was spotted with her beagle and a security guard while strolling around. Looking chic in a beige maxi dress paired with open front shirt, Meghan purchased some flowers and looked at the local produce while her dog remained by her side.

In a photo shared exclusively by Daily Mail, there is a sign at the market that reads: ""NO DOGS ALLOWED with the exception of recognized service animals... we thank you for your understanding and cooperation."" The Mirror US has reached out to the market to verify if this is a rule that they definitely have, and if it was in place when Meghan attended.

There is Yelp page for the market, with a question that reads: ""Is it dog friendly?"" and a response that says: ""No dogs allowed, except service animals. There are signs at every entrance.""

But the rule seems to be pretty lax going by the reviews on Yelp, with one reviewer quick to acknowledge the rule and the ""rule breakers"". Giving future visitors some tips when visiting the market, the reviewer penned: ""Only service dogs are allowed; though many folks were cheating.""

The Duchess' dog could be seen in the snaps published by the Mail, with the beagle beside her the entire time while her security guard held onto the leash.

Meghan's outing came mere hours after her and Harry's Netflix docuseries was brutally snubbed in the nominations for the Primetime Emmy Awards 2023. The couple's documentary series, which dropped onto the streaming platform last December failed to get recognised in the shortlist.

Last month it was reported that the couple's $20 million (£15.5m) Spotify deal came to an end and it was soon said their $98 million (£76.5m) Netflix deal was ""hanging in the balance"" - which likely left them taken aback, so their latest snub will probably have left them feeling a little somber.

But it wasn't all bad news for the couple, because in the week their popular and tell-all docuseries got nominated for Best Streaming Nonfiction Series in the Hollywood Critics Awards (HCA).

Track legend reveals hidden story of her 1993 world title win in Stuttgart and tells Budapest-bound Brits to win the mind game

Sally Gunnell still remembers how it felt, waking up with a cough and a sniffle inside the athletes village. Not feeling at all herself.

Reigning Olympic champion, she was favourite to add the 400m hurdles world title in Stuttgart. She knew it, everybody did.

Beside her bed was a bar of chocolate she had brought from her Swiss training camp as a treat to devour when, not if, she delivered the gold. But she suddenly felt lousy and the pressure from having won in Barcelona the previous summer weighed heavy.

That was 30 years ago and what Gunnell put herself through mentally to become world champion she now wants to pass on in the hope Keely Hodgkinson and others might follow in her footsteps at the 2023 edition in Budapest.

Unlike Gunnell in 1993, Hodgkinson is fit and primed for her tilt at the 800 metres. But it is not physical advice Britain's hurdling legend is looking to share, rather the mind game she won that week.

""Keely has a great chance of winning, I really believe that,"" said Gunnell, the only woman to hold all four major championship gold medals and the world record at the same time.

""What I'd say to her is use the mind, tap into the power of positive thought. See yourself coming through and winning the race. Extinguish doubt.""

In Stuttgart Gunnell sat in her room weighing up her options.

""I thought to myself, ""˜As Olympic champion have I got more to lose if I get knocked out in the first round? What is everybody going to say?'

""I'd never been a quitter but I knew I had three rounds to get through and I had a cold and a cough.

""""˜You're Olympic champion',"" I told myself. """"˜You're in great shape, you've done brilliant training, you can do this'.

""For 48 hours I didn't let any negative demons in. I can't tell you how hard I worked on the mental side.""

Linford Christie had already struck gold for Britain in the 100m, Colin Jackson would add the 110m hurdles later that week. They sat Gunnell down and assured her she would be joining them.

The Essex star not only beat arch-rival Sandra Farmer-Patrick to gold, her time of 52.74 seconds set a world record which to this day remains a British best.

""It shows what you can mentally achieve when you have to,"" Gunnell said. ""So I look at these championships coming up and want our athletes to really believe.""

She is thinking in particular of Hodgkinson, Zharnel Hughes, Laura Muir, Kat Johnson-Thompson and Dina Asher-Smith, all beneficiaries of National Lottery funding whom Gunnell sees winning medals.

Hodgkinson, 21, is the Brit with the best chance, especially with arch-rival Athing Mu a doubt to compete.

""Keely is hungry and she knows what she wants,"" said Gunnell. ""She's not going for silver or bronze. She needs gold now. Use the mind, be positive.""

The RPG is joined by the previously leaked titles The Callisto Protocol and Farming Simulator 22, with all three releasing next Tuesday

Sony has officially confirmed the full list of PS Plus October 2023 Essential Games, with adventures in space, the Old West, and a farm all being made available next week.

Following on from PS Plus leaks earlier this week, PlayStation has officially announced the batch of PS Plus October 2023 Essential titles, confirming that the leaked games - The Callisto Protocol and Farming Simulator 22 - will be a part of the Essential tier. Alongside those two, the third title which hadn't leaked out prior to the official announcement was revealed to be Weird West, a Wild West RPG from the creators of the Dishonored series.

Much like Saints Row which was included in PS Plus September 2023 games, The Callisto Protocol launched last year to middle-of-the-road reviews. While not a bad game, it's certainly a less exciting title to headline PS Plus a month after the PS Plus price increase was announced.

Weird West is probably the highlight of this month's choices. The game takes cues from classic CRPG's like Fallout 1 and 2, and immersive sims like the aforementioned Dishonored. The game takes on an episodic structure with five stories covering five different protagonists during the Wild West era, with supernatural elements taking centre stage in the game's narrative.

PS Plus October 2023 Essential games

Sony officially confirmed the PS Plus October 2023 Essentials games on the PlayStation Blog, and the list is as follows:

These titles will be available to download next Tuesday, October 3, and will remain available to download until Tuesday, November 7, when the next batch of PS Plus Essential titles will release. Make sure to redeem Saints Row, Generation Zero, and Black Desert - Traveler Edition before the PS Plus November 2023 games arrive or they'll be gone forever.

Players with a PS Plus Extra or Premium subscription will also be able to access these games as part of their tiers, but you'll need to wait until Wednesday, October 11 to find out what the PS Plus Extra and Premium October 2023 titles will be, before they become available on Tuesday, October 17.

But you'll be able to download and enjoy the PS Plus Extra and Premium September 2023 games, including Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139""¦ and Sid Meier's Civilization 6.

Former Emmerdale actor Kelvin Fletcher is documenting his life running a 120-acre farm in the Peak District with his wife and four kids despite having no experience

Former Emmerdale star Kelvin Fletcher is set to return to ITV seven years after leaving the soap.

The 39-year-old - who also wowed fans with his moves on Strictly Come Dancing which he won in 2019 - has landed his very own reality show.

Kelvin, who played Andy Sugden on Emmerdale for 20 years, revealed the new show is called Fletcher's Family Farm.

It will follow the adventures of Kelvin, his actress wife Liz and their four children, Marnie, six, Milo, four, and one-year-old twin boys, Maximus and Mateusz.

Sharing the news on Instagram, he told his 486,000 followers: ""A brand new ITV1 series this Autumn bringing you inside our lives as we celebrate and explore this wonderful farming life!

""With more animals, more laughs, more mistakes and even more children! This adventure really has only just begun. We can't wait to share it with you! Let the fun begin!""

The documentary-style programme is set at Kelvin's 120-acre farm in the Peak District, which he moved into in 2021. Prior to that, the family lived in Manchester.

It is being made by Leeds-based Daisybeck Studios and commissioned for weekday daytime for ITV and ITVBe in the first co-commission between the two channels.

Viewers got a glimpse into Kelvin's life on the farm when he starred in a six-part series on the BBC last year.

Kelvin's Big Farming Adventure followed Kelvin as he learned how to run a farm, just like his former Emmerdale character Andy.

With the help of a next-door neighbour, Gilly, who has experience in the industry, Kelvin and his family got stuck into all that farm life brings.

But the show was slammed by some, who called it a ""˜rip off Clarkson's Farm'.

One viewer tweeted: ""How much does Kelvin Fletcher want to copy Jeremy Clarkson with his new farm."" While another said: ""Clarkson's Farm it ain't.""

Unlikely farmer Jeremy Clarkson became a lockdown smash hit after documenting his attempts to farm the 1,000-acre Diddly Squat Farm in Oxfordshire.

Clarkson's Farm went on to break Amazon Prime viewing records as the most highly watched show on the platform.

Addressing the comparison to Clarkson's Farm, Kelvin said there is still a huge appetite for this sort of show and they're all very different in their own ways.

He revealed their original plan was to move to the US, but this was thwarted by the lockdown.

Speaking exclusively to The Mirror at the end of last year, Kelvin said : ""It may seem like we have a showbizzy life, but every top I've got has baby sick on the shoulder.

""That's just the way it is, as any parent will tell you. There have been so many highlights this year.

""We're still only in our second year on the farm with a lot to learn, but it's great.""

Wife Liz, who starred in BBC One drama In The Club, says: ""It's been an amazing reaction. Farmers have welcomed us into the community and want to give us advice.""

Kelvin and Liz knew each other as children and became a couple after Liz finished university. They married in London in 2015 after Kelvin proposed on a beach in Wales.

Gareth Wyn Jones, 56, was sent an £80,000 bill by British Gas which needed paying within five days - due to an IT error and the farmer says he worries how vulnerable people would have coped

A farmer was left in shock after British Gas sent him an electricity bill for £80,099 which needed paying within FIVE days.

Gareth Wyn Jones, who often appears on TV, discovered that an IT error was the cause of the demand, which was more than 22 times higher than it should have been.

He received a huge pile of paperwork and an order to pay the full amount within days on October 23. He was worried about what might have happened if his elderly father, 87, who is also a partner in the farm business in Llanfairfechan, North Wales, had opened the letter.

""He's just had a knee operation and recently returned home from hospital,"" Gareth, 56, said. ""I dread to think how some vulnerable people might have reacted. An £80,000 bill! If someone was depressed or had had a bad day, it might have tipped them over the edge.""

After spending two frustrating hours on the phone to overseas call centres, and finally its complaints team, Gareth was assured an error had been identified: old, fully paid-up contracts dating back to 2020 had been incorrectly included in the bill. The correct amount was £3,600 across the farm's various holdings.

On Tuesday morning he received another pile of envelopes from British Gas Business. ""There's 40 or 50 of them!"" he told NorthWalesLive. ""I'll look at them later - I'm too busy rounding up sheep. By the time I got hold of the complaints department, I was fuming, virtually frothing at the mouth.

""In all my life I don't think I've ever been so angry. Honest to God, it was unbelievable: they couldn't even find our account because, as a farm, we don't have a house number.

""We've always paid by direct debit yet suddenly this huge bill comes through the post with no explanation and a demand for immediate payment. We need to do something to ensure these mistakes don't happen again - or, if they do, these companies are liable to compensation.""

British Gas said Gareth's family has a group account with eight energy meters across its various farm holdings. He receives one bill covering energy usage across all of these meters.

A spokesperson said: ""We are really sorry. The high bill Mr Jones received was incorrect and generated in error. We have apologised and confirmed that his actual account balance is £3,672.37.""

Gareth presented the BBC's Family Farm alongside Kate Humble and is often see on Countryfile.

BBC's Countryfile has been exploring issues at the heart of the British countryside for 35 years today. We take a look at where some of its long-standing presenters are now

The first episode of Countryfile was broadcast 35 years ago today and since then, it has become a staple Sunday night viewing for families across the country.

The BBC One hit programme has been exploring places and issues at the heart of the British countryside since its first episode on July 24, 1988, after it replaced the long-standing show, Farming.

Over its more than three-decade-long tenure, a number of faces have come and gone as hosts of the show, except for John Craven.

The renowned broadcaster started work on the show a year after its launch and remained as the main presenter up until 2009. He is now joined by various familiar faces of the BBC, including Matt Baker and Helen Skelton.

Here, we take a look at where some of the presenters are up to now as it celebrates its 35-year history.

Chris Baines

Chris Baines was one of the first presenters of Countryfile and became known as one of the UK's leading independent environmentalists. After leaving the hit show in 1992, he went on to work on other wildlife spin-off shows, including Charlie's Wildlife Gardens with h Charlie Dimmock.

Now the 76-year-old, from Sheffield, writes for BBC Gardeners' World, BBC Wildlife and Country Living magazines and features as a regular expert on BBC Radio 4.

Ian Breach

Also among the first-ever presenters was Ian Breach, who sadly died from lung cancer in 2013. The former Guardian journalist moved into television when he began making films for BBC's Look North and other programmes. They led to a successful period in Birmingham as chief reporter on Countryfile before he became one of the BBC's first environment correspondents.

Roger Tabor

Roger Tabor was another one of the original presenters on the show thanks to his expertise as a biologist and naturalist. On the 30th anniversary of the show in 2018, Roger tweeted: ""What an amazing series we started.""

However the 75-year-old is now best known for his groundbreaking BBC TV series 'Cats'. Roger is now recognised as one of the leading authorities on the felines.

John Craven

The show's most longstanding presenter is John Craven, who has been the face of the programme for more than 30 years. He joined the Countryfile team following success on BBC's Newsround - originally known as John Craven's Newsround - which saw him become a household name among the broadcaster during the seventies and eighties.

John, who left the show as a full-time host in 2009, has been with his wife, Marilyn, for more than 50 years after their paths reportedly first crossed at the BBC. He was working at the BBC in Newcastle while Marilyn was a production secretary on Look North.

The dad-of-two daughters previously described the mum of his kids as his 'rock', adding: ""Without being too soppy, she was always there for me, which is the main thing in my business because it can be precarious. You're very exposed, and it's always good to be able to get that reassurance."" Despite now being 82, the journalist is still working in television.

Matt Baker

When the show moved to Sunday evenings in April 2009, the team broadcast from the Lake District for the new primetime slot, which is where Matt Baker made his debut. But before his days of presenting in muddy fields, he was a well-known face in the studio for much-loved Blue Peter.

Matt won the BAFTA for best children's television presenter two years in a row while working on the hit show, along with claiming a Royal Television Society award. Despite his successes, when he first started out he was a bundle of nerves, and requested to have a dog on the show with him, like many presenters before him.

At just nine weeks old, Meg the collie joined Matt and stayed with him up until his last episode in 2006. The pooch then went home with him, where he lives in Hertfordshire with his wife Nicola, who he married in 2004, and their children Luke and Molly.

While Matt has now been a presenter for Countryfile for more than a decade, he also made a name for himself on The One Show. Viewers could catch him on the red sofa alongside co-star Alex Jones from 2011 to 2020.

Before his departure, Matt explained how he wanted to spend more time with his family on their farm. Meanwhile, Alex also opened up on why he left, telling the Express: ""It wasn't right for him at that stage in his life, we are quite different people in many ways. Matt didn't really want to come into London on a daily basis, he's not a city person.""

Anita Rani

Like all Countryfile presenters, Anita joined the show because of her love for the outdoors. As a youngster growing up in Bradford, she escaped to the country each weekend with her parents and said that at the time, they would be the only Asian family out in the Yorkshire Moors.

After graduating from broadcasting at Leeds University, Anita's main presenting gig came in 2008 when she joined BBC show Watchdog and also The One Show. She later became a regular face on Countryfile from 2015 and in the same year, joined the BBC's dancing competition, Strictly Come Dancing.

Anita is still a regular on our screens and alongside presenting also for the BBC's Asian Network, the star has gone on to work on Channel 4 shows as well as Channel 5 news programme, The Edit. The TV presenter lives in East London with her husband Bhupinder Rehal, who she met at a warehouse party.

Helen Skelton

Just like her co-star Matt, Helen Skelton rose to fame by presenting Blue Peter. The 40-year-old, who grew up on a dairy farm in Cumbria, then joined the line-up at Countryfile in 2014.

The mum-of-three has previously said her city friends don't understand life in the country. ""It's difficult for my city friends to appreciate what life is like in farming. It's a different culture.

""I think a lot of people see the bad weather, being outside and dirty fingernails as a hardship, but I know plenty of folks that would rather shovel cow muck than have to get on the Tube every day.""

Helen has made headlines in recent times following her breakup with her ex-husband rugby star Richie Myler, whom she married in 2013. Helen announced their split last April, just four months after the birth of their daughter in December 2021. It was shortly after revealed that Richie's new girlfriend, Stephanie Thirkill, was pregnant with their first child.

A few months after their marriage breakdown, Helen received immense support during her stint on Strictly Come Dancing, where she was partnered alongside professional dancer Gorka Marquez. Since then, she has gone from strength to strength and is reportedly now looking for a clean slate.

A source shared: ""Helen has moved on with her life and feels it's time to start with a clean slate. She's put the house they shared on the market and is looking for a new place she can move to with the kids in the coming months.""

Alongside her Countryfile duties, Helen will now be fronting a new TV series with Strictly Come Dancing star Dan Walker. Teaming up with Channel 5 news presenter Dan, the pair - who are said to be good friends - are set to explore Britain's oldest and most iconic hiking trail, The Pennine Way.

Matt Baker's fans and famous friends rushed to send the former Blue Peter presenter messages of condolences on Thursday, as The One Show star announced the death of one of his beloved dogs

Matt Baker had been inundated with support following the death of one of the star's beloved animals.

The former One Show host admitted his heart was broken as he shared the sad news on Instagram on Thursday, with his followers flooding the farmer with well wishes and messages of condolences.

Posting to his Farm On The Hill account - based on the Channel 4 series documenting his family's farming adventures - Matt, 45, shared a collection of snaps of his late dog alongside the sad update.

Captioning the pictures, he told his fans: ""So sad, we've said Goodbye to Isla, our oldest & smallest cairn at 13yrs. She was sweet natured, kind, tough, fast as lightning, and a patient gentle Mum.

""She was the one with the voice to let us know when they all wanted to be in or be out.. We'll miss her #cairnterrier #doglovers #friendforlife.""

Matt then took to his personal Instagram account to comment underneath the update, writing: ""The reason we love dogs so much is the only time they break our hearts is when they leave us.""

Steps singer Ian 'H' Watkins was one of the first to send Matt some love, telling the star: ""Big hugs.""

""I'm so so sorry for your loss. I know what it's like to lose a family member, she will never leave your side, or your heart,"" one of Matt's fans wrote underneath the emotional post.

""So very sorry to hear that. I'm certain she couldn't have had any better life than with you,"" another wrote, as a third added: ""Think I had the pleasure of meeting her unexpectedly a couple of months back! So sorry for your loss, they are part of the family. sending love xxx.""

Former Blue Peter presenter Matt often introduces his animals to fans on social media, alongside documenting his family's farm life in a Channel 4 series.

Matt Baker: Our Farm in the Dales premiered in 2021 and documented Matt's return to his childhood county of Durham to help his parents run the family farm.

The three-season series followed the star in running the farm's day-to-day operations following his mum's serious injury.

Earlier this week, Matt announced a brand new show - this time based in America.

Writing on Instagram, he revealed: ""TONIGHTS the first episode of ""˜Travels in The Country USA ""˜ - if you fancy a trip to rural America to meet some wonderful people doing incredible things join me on More4 at 9 o'clock.

""Thank you to More4 and my wonderful team who've helped me to make this fantastic series, the heart of those on and off screen shines through x.

512,"Potatoes and carrots are most popular Christmas veggies - but the worst for greenhouse gases","https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/food-drink/christmas-dinner-vegetables-greenhouse-gases-31683715","Potatoes and carrots are most popular Christmas veggies - but the worst for greenhouse gases

The two vegetables are each responsible for almost a fifth of the GHG emissions needed to produce an entire Christmas meal

Potatoes and carrots are the two most popular vegetables to serve up with a Christmas Day dinner - but are also the two worst culprits of the meal when it comes to the greenhouse gases emitted during their production, research has found.

A survey of 2,000 adults, who celebrate the holiday season, found that over three-quarters (78%) will sit down to a traditional Christmas meal on December 25 - with 88% of these serving up potatoes, while 81% will have carrots on their plate.

However, individually, these two veggies are each responsible for almost a fifth (18%), of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), that come from producing an entire festive dinner.

Other popular vegetables that rank highly in terms of GHG emissions include peas, which are enjoyed by 43% of Brits on the big day, and produce 15% of emissions from the meal.

Meanwhile, parsnips and sprouts are each responsible for 14% of Christmas dinner GHG emissions - but are enjoyed by 64%, and 75%, respectively.

Overall, scientific modelling revealed that around 14,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases are emitted each year in the UK, just to produce the vegetables on our plates on Christmas Day.

However, the research estimates these emissions could be cut by up to a fifth, by using smart, 5G-enabled technologies in farming and food distribution - the equivalent of saving enough energy to power Christmas tree lights in 7.3 million UK households on the big day.

The data, commissioned by Vodafone, conducted by WPI Economics, and modelled by Development Economics, used a survey of 2,000 adults to find out what vegetables people will tuck into during Christmas dinner.

It then looked at several aspects of UK food and drink manufacturing - including the average GHG emissions created by ""traditional"" approaches to producing Brits' favourite vegetables (per kg of output).

This revealed the average UK GHG emissions from the production of our favourite vegetables in a festive dinner is 0.842 kg - meaning those who will enjoy the dish on Christmas Day will produce an estimated 13,803 metric tons of GHG.

Research found the combination of 5G-enabled precision technology, used to apply seeds, pesticides, and fertilizer; Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which reduces food wastage on farms; and vehicle-to-everything technology, to make transporting food to retailers more efficient, could amount to an estimated overall saving of 3,302 metric tons of GHG emissions.

Andrea Dona, CTO at Vodafone, which is proposing a combination with Three UK to enable an £11billion investment to create better 5G networks over the next decade, said: ""While this is a light-hearted way of looking at the energy that can be saved by the deployment of proper 5G technologies, the message is a serious one, and there are genuine time, money, and carbon savings that can be achieved.

""The Christmas Dinner and farming example is a topical illustration - but 5G really has the power to supercharge many UK industries, and so the roll-out of the infrastructure in the UK is critical for helping us meet our climate goals quicker.""

The research also found that other popular vegetables to serve up on the big day include broccoli (41%), cauliflower (36%), and cabbage (21%). Meanwhile, kale was at the bottom of the list, being dished up by just 3% of respondents.

Where possible, 54% were likely to seek out British or locally grown veggies, in support of UK farmers (78%), and to make sure their veggies are as fresh as possible (58%).

However, a fifth of those surveyed didn't realise the vegetables on their Christmas Dinner plate could have a negative impact on the environment.

It also emerged that over half (52%) of those polled, via OnePoll, will use up their Christmas leftovers in turkey sandwiches, bubble and squeak (29%), or a turkey curry (23%).

Doug Inglis and his long-time partner Jenny Gusse were camping in Banff National Park with their border collie Tris when they were attacked and killed by a female grizzly bear

Two campers who were mauled to death in a grizzly bear attack have managed to send one last desperate message before they died from their injuries.

Doug Inglis and his longtime partner Jenny Gusse, both 62, were camping in Banff National Park in Canada in late September with their dog when the attack happened. At some point during or after their horrific attack, the pair were able to send a final chilling text along with an SOS signal.

""Bear attack, bad"", read the message, according to Doug's uncle, Colin Inglis. The message was sent using a Garmin inReach satellite communicator on Friday, September 29. The message was sent with an SOS signal, which was triggered by someone holding the device's emergency button for three seconds.

""So one of them had entered that [text] into the inReach"" manually, explained Colin. The spine-chilling message serves as evidence of the moment a hiking trip to enjoy the spectacular fall foliage became a tragedy.

But the attack raised questions. How did two veteran hikers, known for doing everything correctly and by the book, become the victims of a rare grizzly bear attack?

""This incident is the first grizzly bear-caused fatality recorded in Banff National Park in decades"", explained Parks Canada. Park authorities received an alert of a bear attack on their GPS system at around 8pm on the Friday.

The alert came from the Red Deer River Valley inside the park. A Parks Canada WIldlife Human Attack Response Team was sent to the location on the ground as the weather did not allow a helicopter response. The team made it to the location at around 1am on the Saturday where they found the two bodies as well as a grizzly bear exhibiting aggressive behaviour.

The bear was euthanised on-site ""to ensure public safety"", said the park. Police got to the scene at 5am on Sunday where the victims were transported to Sundre, Alberta. In a statement after the attack, the park said: ""This is a tragic incident, and Parks Canda wishes to express its sincere condolences to the families and friends of the victims.""

Doug and Jenny were prepared for their trip to the park, as the Wildlife Human Attack Response Team found a bear-proof food bag hanging in a tree, as recommended. They also found a discharged can of bear spray was also found at the site, indicating the pair had tried to force the animal to leave.

""They hiked in this area several times a year on an extended trip,"" said Colin. ""They've been in this area in the spring.""

The couple were on a weeklong trek through Banff and used their inReach device to send regular updates to Colin and Jenny's mother. They were detailed when it came to planning their adventures. They were known to be careful by nature, with the couple working together in laboratories carrying out agricultural research.

""Doug and Jenny were highly experienced. They did everything right,"" said Colin. ""This is an unusual circumstance - they ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time.""

Earlier in the day, the couple had hit a delay during their hike but messaged Colin to say they were alright. He said they had likely made it to a campsite and were making dinner when the message was sent, just before 5pm. But just hours later, things went terribly wrong.

Doug and Jenny made camp in a permitted area, along with their border collie, Tris. At the time, there was no active bear warning or areas closed according to Parks Canada.

The agency says it got the same message from an inReach device that Colin did at around 8pm local time, alerting them to the bear attack. But it took them hours to reach the site of the violent attack as they were forced to travel over ground instead of by helicopter.

According to Parks Canada, the area is very remote and there were no witnesses to the attack. It said: ""We will never know the full details of what led to the attack and will not speculate.""

""Jenny and Doug were [found] close by each other not far from the tent in their stocking feet,"" Colin said, relaying what Parks Canada had told him, noting that it was strange as it was wet outside. ""Their boots and booties were in the tent, which suggests that something happened that one or both of them exited the tent.""

When the response teams got to the scene, they found the bodies of the two campers and their dog. They also caught sight of the bear which ""displayed aggressive behaviour and proceeded to charge towards the response team"".

The bear was shot and killed for public safety. An investigation found it was a ""non-lactating older female"" more than 25 years old. They said while she was in fair condition, her teeth were in bad shape and she ""had less than normal body fat for this time of year"".

The bear wasn't tagged or wearing a collar. Overall, bear attacks are very rare, with Parks Canada saying: ""Over the last 10 years, there have been three recorded non-fatal, contact encounters with grizzly bears in Banff National Park.""

Colin agrees that it's pointless to speculate about exactly what happened to his nephew and his partner. But, he added: ""You know, if they hadn't been delayed, they would have been in a different spot"".

""These were real special human beings,"" said Colin. While he's Doug's uncle, he also views the couple as his close friends. Adding: ""I've known Doug since the day he was born. He is more like a little brother than a nephew.""

Doug was a scientist, while Jenny was a research technician in his labs. The pair worked for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. They were partners in everything.

""They have been together almost entirely since they went to university,"" explained Colin. ""They've been a team, completely, in all aspects of their lives, whether it be work, at home, gardening, or canoeing or hiking.""

The couple were environmentally conscious and loved Canada's national park system, seeing themselves as stewards of the wilderness. Colin said: ""They were wonderful people. They were very gentle people.""

Colin said the tragedy is also a reminder of the things that are beyond our control when we head out into the wilderness. He said: ""Being outdoors people ourselves. it's a nightmare that doesn't go away, you know? That's just the reality.""

Vladimir Putin's top security aide, Nikolai Patrushev, has insisted that the dictator is ready to destroy the West if there are any attempts to try to stop Russia's war in Ukraine

Vladimir Putin insists he is ready to destroy the West with nuclear weapons as Russia launched new hypersonic missile tests today, his top security aide has said.

Nikolai Patrushev, 71, insisted the Russian president will attack the West if attempts are made to defeat and dismember Russia.

Patrushev is seen by some as the brains behind Putin's ill-conceived war in Ukraine.

Today Russia has fired supersonic anti-ship missiles into the Sea of Japan in a chilling weapons test, its defence ministry said.

Two P-270 Moskit missiles, that can hit speeds of 2,300mph, were launched with Japan saying no damage had been reported.

A statement posted on Telegram said: ""In the waters of the Sea of Japan, missile ships of the Pacific Fleet fired Moskit cruise missiles at a mock enemy sea target.

""The target, located at a distance of about 100 kilometres, was successfully hit by a direct hit from two Moskit cruise missiles.""

This comes as in an interview with the Kremlin's newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Patrushev said: ""Some people in the West are already talking about revenge that would lead to a military victory over Russia.""

Ignoring Putin's brutal invasion of sovereign Ukraine and threatening full-scale world war, he claimed: ""Russia is patient and is not intimidating anyone with its military superiority.

""However, it possesses unique modern weaponry capable of destroying any adversary including the US in case of a threat to its existence.""

His chilling threats included Putin's demand to dominate Europe.

The US currently ""does as it pleases in Europe ignoring the fact that the leading role on the continent has historically been Russia's"", he told the Kremlin's newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta.

""The Russian empire in the 19th century, the Soviet Union in the 20th.

""That's how it will be in the 21st century as well.""

Patrushev, the longtime secretary of Russia's security council, is eyeing his son, Dmitry Patrushev, 45, Putin's agriculture minister, to become president after Putin.

But the ex-FSB chief warned: ""Nato countries are a party to the [Ukraine] conflict.

""They have turned Ukraine into one big military camp...

""In trying to prolong this military confrontation as long as possible, they are not hiding their main goal - the defeat of Russia on the battlefield and its further dismemberment"";

""The US authorities' unrestrained aspiration to retain the dominant role in the world has at least since 1945 been the source of all instances of escalation in tensions on the global scale.""

He further claimed that American politicians are hostages to their own propaganda and therefore capable of committing missile strikes on Russia.

He added: ""That is shortsighted idiocy of a very dangerous kind.""

Putin's henchman further claimed the US uses ""military-biological laboratories to create new viruses to destroy the peoples of unwanted countries while once clean American cities are drowning in filth and rubbish"".

He emphasises how ""false"" war crimes allegations are made against Putin and his entourage while the West ""turns a blind eye to real acts of genocide and financial machinations carried out with the White House's approval"".

But in his analysis, he maintained ""the collapse of the EU is not far off"".

He believed Washington is looking for the downfall of the EU to not allow Europe to prosper.

In his warped analysis, sanctions against Putin such as curbs on Western medical supplies to Russia by major pharmaceuticals are similar to Hitler's gas chambers.

""It is well known that most of these same companies at one time worked on the development of poison gases and soul-killing agents for Nazi Germany,"" he said.

""They fully supported the ideology of genocide of the so-called ""˜superfluous' peoples.""

His rant continued: ""Let us remember how the same Anglo-Saxons fostered the Nazis in the 1930s, hoping to direct them against the Soviet Union.

""Having earned financial and geopolitical dividends from World War II, today Washington and London are once again indulging in Nazism and fascism.

""Using Ukraine, they do not mind stirring up a pan-European or even global conflict, imagining that they can get away with it.""

His rant appeared to try to rally a Moscow elite who are increasingly doubtful over the wisdom of Putin and Patrushev's direction.

The West ""has opposed our country more than once"", he said.

""Sometimes under the banners of the Poles and Swedes, sometimes with Napoleonic eagles, under the British flag or under the Hitler swastika.

""The result is the same - all attempts to crush Russia are in vain.""

The tick-borne virus causes severe haemorrhaging in patients and its onset is often very rapid, causing bleeding both internally and externally ""” some have dubbed it the ""nose-bleed fever""

A virus dubbed ""nose-bleed fever"" with a fatality rate of 30 per cent has reached another European country as fears grow for its rapid spread.

On 14 August, North Macedonia confirmed a new case of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), according to the European Centre for Disease Control Prevention's latest report. The illness has been deemed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as one of nine diseases that ""pose the greatest public health risk due to their epidemic potential.""

The tick-borne virus causes severe haemorrhaging in patients. Its onset is often very rapid, causing bleeding both internally and externally ""” some have dubbed it the ""nose-bleed fever."" Human-to-human transmission of CCHF is less likely than the transmission of the virus by ticks, typically carried by migratory birds from overseas. Global warming is causing more and more breeds to move to warmer climes and, with a return of June's heatwave considered, CCHF is likely to transmit in the UK too.

Earlier this year, on 30 July, North Macedonia reported a fatal case of CCHF in the central part of the country. The patient was an agricultural worker who reported a tick bite and then developed a fever before being hospitalised and later dying. Sporadic cases of CCHF have also been reported in several neighbouring countries such as Albania, Bulgaria, Greece and Kosovo.

Professor James Wood, who spoke to Parliament's Science, Innovation and Technology Committee recently, told Mirror earlier this month that should the virus reach the UK, a lockdown will ""not be appropriate in any way"" to contain CCHF. The University of Cambridge academic said: ""You'd be unlikely to get the sort of respiratory transmission. So even say, I don't want to call them extreme lockdown enthusiasts, but, someone who thinks that these measures are very important, to impose straightaway, I don't think it would be appropriate as it's not right for this form of infection.""

Nose-bleed fever symptoms are sudden, with fever, muscle ache, dizziness, neck pain, backache, headache, and sore eyes. There may also be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).

CCHF was first identified in the Crimean Peninsula in 1944, with an outbreak in the Congo in 1956 resulting in the modern-day name. There is no vaccine available or any antiviral medication but ribavirin, a medicine used to treat other viruses such as hepatitis C, has shown some promise.

There is concern from the WHO and other health experts about the global spread of the breed of tick that carries the virus, the Hyalomma tick. The wide range of animals on which the tick is found means there is potential for it to become endemic in new communities.

An organization that promotes the consumption of American potatoes, named Potatoes USA, has been pushing the idea of the 'potato hunt' instead of 'egg hunt' amid a recession

Families across the US are shaking up their Easter traditions and ditching the traditional egg hunt for something a little more unusual - a potato hunt.

The rising price of eggs has caused many to switch things up this year, and they've discovered that potatoes make for an egg-cellent replacement.

Potatoes USA, an organization that promotes the consumption of American potatoes, has been pushing the idea of the potato hunt, which they say is not only cheaper but also tastier and less fragile than an egg.

The organization has even suggested using food colouring or paint to decorate the potatoes, just as you would with an egg.

But the fun doesn't stop there, as families can also get creative and carve designs into the inside of a potato to create a potato stamp, which can be used to make Easter-themed art on paper.

The cost of eggs has skyrocketed in recent months, with the average selling price doubling from last year.

And with the cost of chocolate also on the rise due to inflation, families are feeling the pinch this Easter.

But the potato hunt isn't just a cost-saving measure. It's also a fun way to shake things up and try something new.

Families are reporting that their kids are having just as much fun searching for colourful potatoes as they would have had to search for eggs.

The price of eggs has been affected by supply chain disruptions and labour shortages, which have contributed to an overall increase in food costs.

Egg production has also been impacted by an outbreak of avian flu, which led to the loss of over 50 million birds in the US in 2022, according to data released by the US Department of Agriculture.

The avian flu virus can be spread through various means, including contact with wild birds and contaminated equipment.

As a result of these challenges, the price of eggs has risen sharply, with some states seeing prices nearly tripled in the last year.

Egg producers have had to raise prices in response to increased operational costs, including labour and transportation, as well as the cost of preventing avian flu.

The situation has improved somewhat since the outbreak, with wholesale egg prices falling by over 50% since December 2022, according to reports.

However, experts warn that the virus could resurge in the spring when wild birds migrate across the U.S.

Civilians trapped inside North Korea say they have watched mothers, unable to work due to sickness, die of starvation and watched whole families perish from hunger

North Korean citizens have secretly spoken out from the regime-controlled country to share the horror of starvation they currently face.

Civilians trapped inside the country say they have watched mothers, unable to work due to sickness, die of starvation and watched whole families perish from hunger.

A construction worker, using the fake name Chan Ho, who lives near the Chinese border told the BBC that food supplies were so low that five people in his village had already died from starvation.

North Korea remains one of the most repressive countries in the world which is shrouded in secrecy under its rule by authoritarian leader Kim Jong Un.

By using the pandemic as its excuse, the regime has shuttered borders and empowered authorities to stop importing grain from China, as well as the fertilisers and machinery needed to grow food.

This has led to the starvation of its people while its dictator continues to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on developing his nuclear weapons programme.

""The North Korean borders need to open and they need to restart trade and they need to bring these things in for agriculture to improve and they need food to feed the people.

""But right now they are prioritising isolation, they are prioritising repression"", Lina Yoon, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch said to CNN.

One market trader from the north of the country, with the pseudonym Myong Suk, told the BBC that almost three-quarters of the products in her local market used to come from China, but that it was ""empty now"".

Another woman living in the capital Pyongyang said she knew a family of three who had starved to death at home.

""At first, I was afraid of dying from Covid, but then I began to worry about starving to death,"" Chan Ho said.

Three people spoke to the BBC via an organisation in South Korea which leaks information out of the country. At secure locations that could not be bugged, the source relayed the BBC's questions to the citizens to build a picture of what has been happening in the country.

The painstaking process took many months and once the testimonies could be corroborated it built a horror picture of a disaster unfolding.

All three people said since the border closure, they are afraid they will either starve to death or be executed for flouting the rules.

Myong Suk used to provide for her family by selling goods smuggled across the border, so now her income has vanished.

She said her family has never had so little to eat and now other villagers knock on each other's doors begging for money.

In the late 1990s, an infamous famine in North Korea killed as many as three million people.

These stories and other warnings from aid agencies have prompted fears the country could be on the brink of another catastrophe.

Lucas Rengifo-Keller, a research analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN in March that trade data, satellite images and assessments by the United Nations and South Korean authorities all suggest the food supply has now ""dipped below the amount needed to satisfy minimum human needs.""

A British pensioner has died after being attacked by intruders who broke into his Spanish home.

The 81-year-old was rushed to hospital after being assaulted by burglars in Estepa near Seville on Sunday evening. He was admitted to the nearby Merced Hospital in Osuna but died in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

Police have confirmed the victim was a British expat, adding that an investigation is still underway with detectives hunting those responsible.

Friends have paid tribute to the pensioner who was named locally as Albert Boyden after the break-in that led to his death at around 7pm on Sunday.

Lorna Eade wrote on Facebook: ""RIP Albert, lovely man.""

A Spanish pal added: ""My friend Albert Boyden has died. A great man who always had a smile on his face.""

Although police have confirmed the British expat said he had been pushed to the ground by one of the intruders and do not believe he was the victim of a ""beating"" as Spanish press initially reported, the friend added: ""Three madmen entered his home on Sunday around 7pm, beat him up and took the few things he owned.

""I hope the police catch them and they rot in jail. Rest in peace dear Albert.""

The dead man is believed to have lived in Estepa, a town of just over 12,000 inhabitants famous for producing the traditional sweets eaten by Spanish families at Christmas, for several years. He lived alone in a white-washed terraced house.

A town hall source: ""Local police went to the property on Sunday evening at the request of the Civil Guard following an emergency call.

""They spoke to the British pensioner at the scene who told them several individuals had entered his property with the intention of robbing him.

""He had an injury to his face but nothing to suggest he had been beaten up as the initial reports about this incident suggested. He was taken to hospital and went home a few hours later after being treated.

""Around 24 hours later local police were asked to go to the same property and found emergency medical responders assisting the same man. He was taken to hospital and died in the early hours of Wednesday morning.""

The autopsy is believed to have taken place already but the results have not been made pubic, as is normal in Spain.

Estepa is a town and municipality in the extreme south-east of the province of Seville. It is located north of the Sierra del Becerro mountains. As well as being known for its production of Christmas-time sweets called mantecados in Spanish, tourism is a major part of the local economy along with agriculture like olive-growing.

Local reports say police are hunting three suspects, although detectives were not able to confirm the number today.

A Scottish neighbour of Mr Boyden's told today how he found the British expat lying on the floor inside his home when he went to check up on him.

English teacher Ben Seidel, 25, originally from Edinburgh: ""I knocked on his door and there was no answer at first.

""I knocked again and heard him saying, ""˜I'm on the floor.'

""I raced to get a key from another neighbour and found lying on the ground with his dog next to him when I got in.

""He was very disoriented but he said three guys came in and beat him up and he had terrible head pains.

""He looked roughed up although I wouldn't necessarily say he looked as if he had been beaten up.

""He wasn't able to walk or stand up and it was difficult to get him to move.

""The whole house was turned upside-down. It looked as if it had been ransacked.""

He added: ""Me and my family took care of him. That was our relationship with him.

""What's happened has left us all very shocked.""

Ben's mum Karen, 66, also from Edinburgh, added: ""Albert wouldn't hurt a fly. It's terrible what's happened.

""He was like an uncle to me. I used to keep an eye on him.

""He loved history. That was one of his passions.""

Mr Boyden, originally from the London Borough of Croydon, used to work for East Sussex Council.

He had been living in Estepa for around three and a half years.

He had two dogs which friends are now looking after.

Neighbours said Mr Boyden rented the house where he was attacked from a former Ozzy Osbourne guitarist.

A spokesman for the Civil Guard in Seville, which is investigating the incident, confirmed: ""A British man aged 81 has died following a break-in at his home in Estepa near Seville. Officers responded to the incident around 7pm on Sunday and took the victim to hospital.

""He died in the early hours of Wednesday morning. No arrests have yet been made and we are still investigating.""

A police source added: ""The victim told officers he had been pushed by one of the intruders as he tried to resist the break-in. He fell to the ground and was taken to hospital and tragically died some days later.

""He didn't make a formal statement to police before he died and officers are working on the basis of what he told police at the scene before his admission to hospital.

""Officers are still investigating what if anything was taken and that has been complicated by the fact there is no formal statement and the victim was not able to give a detailed account of the incident to detectives before he was hospitalised.""

It is understood the dead man was told he could go home hours after the break-in, and died after being readmitted to La Merced Hospital in Osuna.

Hospital chiefs have not yet made any comment.

Rachel Elnaugh was one of the five investors in the first two seasons of the hit BBC show, but while Peter Jones and Duncan Bannatyne remained in the limelight she disappeared from the show

A former Dragon's Den star has sparked outrage after buying up 70 acres of protected land for a ""self-sustaining food apocalypse-proof site"".

Rachel Elnaugh was one of the original five investors and starred in the first two seasons of the hit BBC show, alongside Duncan Bannatyne, Simon Woodroffe, Peter Jones and Doug Richard.

But her business floundered and was carved up by her fellow dragons, and since then she's slipped out of the limelight - but it turns out she's been busy.

She's purchased 70 acres of protected land including 'ancient' trees and unimproved grassland in Cressbrook Dale, a limestone gorge near Bakewell, Derbyshire, which she refers to as an ""incredible vagina of land"".

Her declared intentions with the land have changed over time, and locals fear she intends to turn it into an eco-farm and retreat for followers of her group, the ""Inner Sanctum"", who believe in a ""food apocalypse"" and the ""great reset"".

Do you remember Rachel Elnaugh? Let us know in the comments...

Rachel Elnaugh became a celebrity of sorts when she appeared on the BBC game show where she competed to invest in new businesses alongside her fellow dragons.

The businesswoman, who starred in the first two series of the show and was initially the only female investor, founded Red Letter Days in 1989 which became a whopping success with a turnover of £18m.

But it eventually faltered and she was ' forced out ' of the show, before her company finally went into administration leaving behind a series of unpaid suppliers and disappointed customers.

Now she's emerged from her lair and snapped up the ancient and protected woodland in the Peak District, angering locals and the local authority in the process.

John Butler, chair of the Cressbrook community group and lead spokesperson for the Save Cressbrook Dale campaign, has lived in the area for the past 50 years and regularly enjoyed walking through the dale - which he described as a ""crown jewel of the Peak District National Park"" - but now he fears for its future.

He said: ""It's not clear what she intends to do with the land, it seems to be changing.

""The original intention that was expressed was to establish a self-sufficient eco-community on the land.

""They had a million-pound business plan in order to bring that to fruition, which included quite a lot of infrastructure that they were going to install, including wind turbines, greenhouses and polytunnels, alongside £90,000 worth of movable structures.

""So at that point, it looked like they were building a settlement on the land. However, it was clear right from the outset that the land is simply not fit for that purpose.

""It's not fertile agricultural land, most of it is ancient woodland, there's 70 acres altogether and 50 are just woodland.

""Some is marginal grazing land, it's very poor soil and unimproved land, so it's never been cultivated in a serious way - so it's not remotely capable of producing viable crops for a self-sufficient community.""

In a letter, Rachel explained to local residents that she had bought the land and stated that she wanted to ""get as much as we can planted for this growing season.""

She stated that it was her intention to ""create a fully self-sustaining 'food-apocalypse-proof' site"", and invited them to ""be part of our growing community of open-hearted souls"".

Rachel's prospectus states that her aim is to ""build a better world"" away from ""polarization of rich and poor"" (sic) and ""ecological devastation"".

After obtaining the land, Rachel posted on Facebook : ""Given the predicted food apocalypse, one of our first priorities will be to create a food forest across the land to nourish the entire Cressbrook community.""

In one version of the prospectus, that has been seen by The Mirror, she encourages people to invest the project, stating that for anything from £20,000 up to £100,000 you could become a ""founding freeholder"".

This entitles the investor to ""access to Cressbrook Dale Estate for yourself and your immediate family"", alongside ""rights to any produce of the land"", including ""wood, vegetables, foraging, natural water"".

The prospectus states that these rights ""will continue, in perpetuity, for the heirs/descendants of the founding Freeholders.""

The document also hints at the structure of the organisation, with ""potentially thousands"" of micro freeholders on the outside of the sphere, or bottom of the pyramid, 15-55 elite ""founding freeholders"", and a group of six who make up the ""Core Mandala""

It states: ""The Core Mandala (aka Phoenix Rose) is the group of six women who both held the vision to manifest this land, as well as being committed to investing, plus having a future involvement in the ongoing management/enhancement of Cressbrook Dale Estate.

""Micro-Freeholders are by-invitation-only visitors over time who will enjoy limited rights to access, for example, a weekend's camping or a shamanic retreat - ensuring that Cressbrook Dale Estate may be enjoyed by many thousands of people over the years, in return for a reasonable amount of financial resources.""

The Core Mandala consists of Rachel Elnaugh, Janet Spence, Leila Rose, Mog Fry, Angela Harrison, and Davina Mackail.

On her website, Rachel writes about the ""Inner Sanctum"", which is on the quest to establish ""several eco-communities across the UK"" where people pool their resources to acquire land.

She wrote: ""I am delighted to let you know that on June 7, 2022, we acquired Cressbrook Dale Estate - a breathtaking c70 acre site near to Monsal Head in the Peak District National Park, Derbyshire UK.

""This opportunity came about quite by chance via one of our local Bakewell 'Stand in the Park' regulars who knew the estate management team at Stanton Estate.

""They had acquired the land when the Cressbrook Mill went bankrupt in the 1930's, had found it difficult to manage, but wanted it to go to a good home.

""The opportunity necessitated a complete shift in our initial vision - as although all c50 acres of forest and c20 acres of pastureland is agricultural there are no farm buildings on site.

""However it is rich in all the resources required for self-sustainability with natural springs plenty of wood and sheltered from the harsher elements of weather.

""We're managing it remotely for now and hope to rent or buy properties in the area as a closer base for those wishing to be on-site more regularly.""

The website also included the words to the 'prayer of the seven galactic directions', and went on to explain how she made a spiritual offering to the land.

Previously, Rachel spoke out about the Covid-19 vaccination program, and in 2021 she sparked outrage when she called for Chris Whitty to hang, calling the vaccination of 12-15-year-olds ""child abuse"".

Some locals believe the ""inner sanctum"" is a cult where people believe the UK is heading to a food apocalypse.

John added: ""What you and I might think of as a cult, people within might think of it as a loving community, certainly she was talking to an audience who had feared apocalyptic change for sure, and were attracted by the thought of some kind of retreat from that.

""She's a very persuasive speaker, she's imbued with the full range of conspiracy theories, and she's very good at regurgitating them and connecting them into one overarching conspiracy. If you're susceptible to that kind of spin, she's very convincing. If you try and analyse what she's saying, it all unravels very quickly.

""She's very skilful at handling any rejection of her point of view, for instance, her expressed view about the covid vaccination program was that that was a conspiracy to insert microprocessors in us, in order to conduct a world population cull.

""If you take a deep breath and think now hang on a minute, there will be many of us that have a bit of anxiety about that, but that leading you to an idea that the world economic forum is organising a program of extermination or a population cull is many steps too far for me.

""She's monetised the threat, and she's done that through her online presence - she makes these pronouncements to people who are already worried about these things, many of us have read that stuff and think it's bonkers but some hang in there and they're clearly vulnerable to a line of argument or accumulation of arguments that don't hold water but do none the less create fear and anxiety and make people at risk.

""I think, I'm speculating and inferring from what she's saying and what she's not saying, her focus has now changed from agriculture towards an assertion to the land they've bought or in the process of buying is some sort of natural temple.

""She has very repeatedly referred to it as 'the great vagina', I think she's moving towards an esoteric healing community centre. She hasn't said that explicitly, let me make that clear.

""I think the plan would depend on the capacity for the land to become a campsite, and there are strict regulations about how much camping is permitted on this land, as well as requirements for sanitation, water supply, all that kind of thing.

Cressbrook Dale is a limestone valley and sits between Bakewell and Buxton, near Matlock, and the woodland in question is home to a rare species of moss and two types of butterfly, the Dark Green Fritillary and the White-letter Hairstreak.

It provides a unique habitat for local flora and fauna and as such, the area is subject to a Tree Preservation Order protecting the trees and woodland.

It is also designated as part of the Natural Zone, the highest level of conservation protection in the Peak District National Park.

Locals believe that all of the stated intentions of the Phoenix Rose community would require change of use planning approval, and the Peak District National Park Authority has made it clear such approval would not be granted.

But since Rachel bought it in May 2022, she has put in a hard-standing car park and installed a caravan and agricultural tools including a polytunnel and a teepee, according to local residents.

The local authority warned Rachel that her activities must stop, and when she carried on they issued a Temporary Stop Notice on July 25.

A spokesperson said: ""Following concerns over the nature of activities recently undertaken on land owned in Cressbrook Dale, the Peak District National Park Authority has served a Temporary Stop Notice, issued a Tree Preservation Order and served a Planning Contravention Notice questionnaire to the landowner, who now has a statutory period to respond.

""Senior officers from both the authority's planning and ecology teams have also engaged with the landowner to discuss the works, and explain the importance of the sensitive habitats and the landscape value of the area.""

John continued: ""The Peak National Park Authority are clearly monitoring the situation, they issued the temporary stop notice, I guess they were hoping that would be sufficient to deter the new owners and I'm pretty sure that they will at some point take some enforcement action because there is some stuff on the land that has been there for six months, which is illegal.

""The trouble is it's not just our back garden, the fact is that land is heavily protected by the national park, all those items shouldn't be there, there on a piece of open access land, which means that anyone can go through anywhere they want on that land.

""It's because it is one of the last wild spaces and it supports an amazing array of natural flora and fauna. The biodiversity is remarkable there, and that's because it's been unchanged, not dug, up, not cultivated, for a very long time.

""Everything they have done to the land so far, which is clearly the beginning of their plans, has been detrimental to the land because of its fragility.

""When you look into it and think why was this land given this level of protection, what makes it so special, you see that everything they've done is quite unacceptable.""

Annie Sanderson, 66, a resident in Cressbrook, described the project as a ""disaster"". She said: ""The dale is beautiful, it is why people moved here. We were given no consultation, we just started seeing videos being posted by this group about a food apocalypse"".

On Rachel's website, she also talks about ""PsyOps"" being used to ""manipulate the masses"" and win elections, describing it as the "" day democracy died "".

Local resident Jenny Caven said: ""I think what they're doing is creating a community, that's what she's trying to sell to investors - that they will be able to support themselves when things go wrong - when they go apocalyptic.

""One of the things that is interesting, is that investors aren't investors in the original sense - they can't get their money back if they want to pull out, they're putting money into something that they believe in - they're not necessarily ever going to be able to get their money back out, so it's not a safe investment.

""She's trying to get people to put money into something that isn't a rational thing but an emotional thing.

""She bought the land for £640,000, they made an initial payment of £240,000 and according to their prospectus were scheduled to pay a further two payments of £200,000 in August and October.

""It is not clear whether those payments have been made. They set out a total investment capital requirement of £1 million. The cost of the land is £640,000 payable to Stanton Estate, £30,000 payable is fees and stamp duty with a balance of £330,000 to be raised from investors.

""It's not clear what it's for. It's a lot money for people who don't know if they'll get it back, and a lot of money to invest in infrastructure.""

Lynn Crowe, a local resident and emeritus professor of environmental management at Sheffield Hallam University, said: ""These limestone dales are the closest thing that we have to true wilderness in the area.

""They are home to different species of orchid and rare butterflies including the Dark Green Fritillary and the White-letter Hairstreak.

""The area needs to be protected as a precious last refuge for wildlife, and so that the area remains accessible to walkers and nature lovers who come to enjoy the tranquillity and solitude of the area.""

Rachel describes the community backlash as ""propaganda"", and defended her actions to a reporter from Derbyshire Live.

She said: ""It is a bit sad really, we don't intend to do anything that's going to damage the dale and in fact us being here, everything we've done has been quite beautiful. A lot of people have thanked us.

""You would almost expect to see some form of nightmare skyscraper or some type of Alton Towers theme park rollercoaster or something crazy.

""I do appreciate that with any change there is fear and we have tried to reassure the local people it is not our intention to do any harm

""I feel everything we've done is a beautiful enhancement. We've put limestone gravel down because that is the rock of the land, so it blends in.""

The Daily Mirror spoke to Rachel Elnaugh who refused to provide a comment, but insisted that she has no intention to alter the use of the land, that she is the victim of a hate campaign, and that the claims of the Save Cressbrook Dale campaign group are propaganda.

520,"El NiÃ±o is officially BACK threatening intense floods, droughts, wildfire and PLAGUE","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/el-nio-officially-back-threatening-30208492","El NiÃ±o is officially BACK threatening intense floods, droughts, wildfire and PLAGUE

The United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has officially declared El NiÃ±o is underway and scientists warn it could bring record hot temperatures and contribute to extreme events including droughts, cyclones and infectious diseases

Blistering climate phenomenon El NiÃ±o has officially begun and threatens torrential rains, drought and horrific spikes in diseases spread by moquitoes.

Only occuring every three to seven years, the cyclical warming of the world's oceans and weather sparks tropical cyclones in the Pacific, and gave the world its hottest year on record in 2016.

And scientists are worried that this year could see El NiÃ±o return evern stronger, with the impact felt across the globe, sparking forest fires, intense rainfall, floods, and surges in infectious diseases including malaria and even plague.

On Thursday, the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) declared that an El NiÃ±o was now underway, after the past three years were dominated by the cooler La NiÃ±a climate pattern.

Already in Peru, the country's worst outbreak of horrid dengue fever has killed more than 200 people this year, with more than 130,000 recorded cases - the highest since 2017.

And it is feared El NiÃ±o will make the outbreak of the mosquito-borne tropical disease even worse.

Dengue fever can be fatal, and hits sufferers with a high fever, headache, vomiting and muscle and joint pain.

Increased rainfall and flood risk causes mosquitoes to mass reproduce due to the build of water in cities.

It also forces rats to move to higher ground and into towns and villages, where they come into contact with humans more often - sparking explosions of plague and leptospirosis.

El NiÃ±o appears to have formed early this year, and is likely to be strong, warp weather worldwide and give an already warming Earth an extra kick of natural heat, meteorologists announced.

The NOAA issued an El NiÃ±o advisory, announcing the arrival of the climatic condition and warning it may not be like the others.

Head of NOAA's El NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a forecast office, climate scientist Michelle L'Heureux, revealed it formed a month or two earlier than most El NiÃ±os do, which ""gives it room to grow.""

She said there's a 56% chance it will be considered strong and a 25% chance it reaches supersised level.

Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Brown University, said: ""If this El NiÃ±o tips into the largest class of events...it will be the shortest recurrence time in the historical record.""

Such a short gap between El NiÃ±os leaves communities with less time to recover from damages to infrastructure, agriculture, and ecosystems like coral reefs.

Usually, an El NiÃ±o mutes hurricane activity in the Atlantic, giving relief to coastal areas in states from Texas to New England, Central America and the Caribbean, weary from recent record busy years.

But forecasters don't see that happening this time, because of record hot Atlantic temperatures that would counteract the El NiÃ±o winds that normally decapitate many storms.

Hurricanes strengthen and grow when they travel over warm seawater, and the tropical regions of the Atlantic Ocean are ""exceptionally warm,"" said Kristopher Karnauskas, associate professor at the University of Colorado Boulder. So this year, NOAA and others are predicting a near-average Atlantic hurricane season.

In the past, a strong El NiÃ±o has led to record global warmth, like in 2016 and 1998. Scientists earlier this year had been saying next year is more likely to set a record heat, especially because El Ninos usually reach peak power in winter. But this El NiÃ±o started even earlier than usual.

University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd said: ""The onset of El NiÃ±o has implications for placing 2023 in the running for warmest year on record when combined with climate-warming background.""

An El NiÃ±o is a natural, temporary and occasional warming of part of the Pacific that shifts weather patterns across the globe, often by moving the airborne paths for storms.

The world earlier this year got out of an unusually long-lasting and strong La NiÃ±a - El NiÃ±o's flip side with cooling - that exacerbated drought in the US West and augmented Atlantic hurricane season.

What this in some ways means is that some of the wild weather of the past three years - such as drought in places - will flip the opposite way.

""If you've been suffering three years of a profound drought like in South America, then a tilt toward wet might be a welcome to development,"" added Michelle L'Heureux said. ""You don't want flooding, but certainly there are portions of the world that may benefit from the onset of El NiÃ±o.""

For the next few months, during the northern summer, El NiÃ±o will most be felt in the Southern Hemisphere with ""minimal impacts"" in North America, Michelle L'Heureux said.

El NiÃ±o strongly tilts Australia toward drier and warmer conditions with northern South America - Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela - likely to be drier and Southeast Argentina and parts of Chile likely to be wetter, she said. India and Indonesia also tend to be dry through August in El NiÃ±os.

While traditionally El NiÃ±o means fewer hurricanes in the Atlantic, it often means more tropical cyclones in the Pacific, Michelle L'Heureux said.

El NiÃ±o hits hardest in December through February, shifting the winter storm track farther south to the equator.

The entire southern third to half of the United States, including California, is likely to be wetter in El NiÃ±o.

For years, California was looking for El NiÃ±o rain relief from a decades long megadrought, but this winter's seemingly endless atmospheric rivers made it no longer needed, she said.

The US Pacific Northwest and parts of the Ohio Valley can go dry and warm, Michelle L'Heureux said.

She added that some of the biggest effects are likely to be seen in a hotter and drier Indonesia and adjacent parts of Asia.

Also look for parts of southern Africa to go dry.

On the other hand, drought-stricken countries in northeast Africa will welcome beneficial rainfall after enduring drought conditions for several years due to prolonged La NiÃ±a events, said Azhar Ehsan, associate research scientist at Columbia University.

Some economic studies have shown that La NiÃ±a causes more damages in the United States and globally than El NiÃ±o.

One 2017 study in an economic journal found El NiÃ±o has a ""growth-enhancing effect"" on the economies of the United States and Europe, while it was costly for Australia, Chile, Indonesia, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa.

But a recent study says El NiÃ±o is far more expensive globally than previously thought, putting damage estimates in the trillions of dollars. The World Bank estimated that the 1997-1998 El NiÃ±o cost governments $45 billion.

The United States also faces hazards from El NiÃ±o despite some benefits.

Azhar Ehsan noted that the increased rainfall in California, Oregon, and Washington heightens the risk of landslides and flash flooding in these areas. ""

While El NiÃ±o brings benefits in terms of water resource recharge, it poses certain hazards that need to be considered and managed,"" he added.

Parker, a six-year-old giraffe, died at Seneca Park Zoo in Rochester, New York after getting caught in a gate in its enclosure. The animal was described as 'a joy' to visitors and staff

A six-year-old Masai giraffe has tragically died after getting caught in a support structure in its enclosure at a popular zoo in New York.

The animal, named Parker, was found unresponsive at Seneca Park Zoo in Rochester, on Sunday morning.

The zoo said staff found the giraffe stuck when they entered the Animals of the Savanna Building and veterinary staff were called immediately.

Vets tried to save the young giraffe's life, but the animal ultimately died.

Superintendent Steve Lacy said the gate structure was installed in 2018 and is a ""standard giraffe enclosure feature"" used in zoos across the country.

He explained: ""The possibility of this kind of event happening was unforeseen and unprecedented.""

Zoo officials said no similar incidents have happened, but they have notified the gate manufacturer about the potential hazard.

They added that the structure is now being modified to ensure the wellness of three other giraffes named Iggy, Kipenzie, and Olmsted.

The zoo said Parker, who arrived at Seneca Park Zoo from Santa Barbara Zoo in 2018, was ""in excellent health"" and was described as ""a joy"" to visitors and staff.

Parker was ""known for his curiosity and playfulness"". The giraffe was paired with females Kipenzi and Iggy, and is father to Olmsted, born in April 2022.

Seneca Park Zoo Veterinarian Chris McKinney said in a statement: ""Parker will be sorely missed by all. He had been in excellent health prior to this and was a joy to both staff and visitors.

""Our priority is the health and well-being of our animals and any major event can certainly affect them.

""So far, all three giraffes, Iggy, Kipenzie, and Olmsted, are doing well. We will continue to monitor them closely in the coming days.""

The zoo said both the US Department of Agriculture and the Association of Zoos and Aquariums have been notified of the accident.

Dan Ashe, president and CEO of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, said: ""Our hearts go out to the Seneca Park community and all the dedicated professionals at Seneca Park Zoo with the news of the death of their giraffe Parker.""

Monroe County Executive Adam Bello said: ""This is a tragedy for the Seneca Park Zoo community.

""From the staff who cared for and loved Parker, to the zoo guests and members who had their visits brightened by Parker's presence, we are all grieving this tremendous loss.""

The Zoo Society announced it would create a Facebook fundraiser with all contributions going to the Giraffe Conservation Foundation.

Jessica Boulton looks back on the life of King Charles ahead of his historic Coronation this weekend

It was 70 years ago that King Charles attended his first coronation in Westminster Abbey.

Then he was just four-year-old boy, in navy blue shorts and a ruffled white shirt, fidgeting in the pews, under the doting eyes of his beloved grandmama, The Queen Mother.

The boom in sales of televisions, meant more of the nation than ever before was seeing just what he saw: A young woman, of just 26, being crowned Queen, with all the tradition and pomp the British adore.

To viewers she was Queen Elizabeth II. To Charles, she was - and would always be - ""mummy"" - a moniker which belies the ""detached"" nature of their relationship, yet speaks volumes about the warmth and approval Charles has spent his life chasing.

Today Charles, now 74, will finally sit where his mother once did, hear the same ancient words, take part in the same historic rituals and make the same pledge to serve the nation.

Between these two coronations, over those seven decades, his every choice has been overshadowed by the same question, how will this affect me as future King? Only now - years after most his age have retired - does he get to stop auditioning for the part and finally start his job.

All that waiting has however also shaped the type of king he will be.

Royal confidante Giles Brandreth believes the older, remarried Charles ""now feels complete"": He's made his mistakes, had his scandals, caused embarrassments, been prey to puppet masters, lived through the ups and downs of wildly-fluctuating opinion polls, learned to trust his own mind, loved, lost, rebelled... and now is ready to fulfil his destiny.

Little has influenced him more than his childhood.

The Queen and Prince Philip were famously ""hands-off"" with Charles and sister Anne - far more than with the younger Andrew and Edward.

""It's not that she was distant or even cold,"" The Queen's former private secretary, Martin Charteris once said of the late monarch. ""But she was very detached."" Or, as her cousin Margaret Rhodes, put it: ""The family is not set up to be cozy.""

Young Charles - sensitive, quiet and emotional, compared to no-nonsense Anne - was originally scheduled to see his Ma and Pa for just 15 minutes twice a day, spending the rest of his time with nanny Marion Crawford, his granny, his godfather Louis Mountbatten - and his beloved stuffed bear, Teddy (who still travels everywhere with Charles now).

""He shared his mother with an institution, she was monarch first and ""˜mummy' second,"" explains historian Tessa Dunlop, author of Elizabeth and Philip, the story of Young Love, Marriage and Monarchy. ""Post-coronation Elizabeth left her son and went on a six-month Commonwealth tour with Philip. When they were finally reunited in Libya, Charles had to wait in turn for his handshake. Here was a boy who, despite his sensitive disposition, had to learn to stand on his own two feet.""

It was a lesson he learned time and again - as a teen he spent 10 days in a nursing home with pneumonia, and no visits from his busy ma and pa.

But nowhere taught him self-dependence better than Gordonstoun, Phillip's tough, outdoorsy alma mater in far-flung north-east Scotland, where Charles was sent aged 13.

""Gordonstoun was supposed to "" ""˜make a man out of him,' although I never really understood what that meant,"" his mother's cousin Margaret Rhodes once explained.

It meant... years of bullying.

Sporty Phillip had thrived there, but he hadn't been a shy 13-year-old future heir - a bully's dream.

Each night Charles was pummelled in his bed. He was set upon in the showers, thrown naked in a wicker basket, hoisted off the ground, and blasted with freezing water. He hung there for 30 minutes.

""The people in my dormitory are foul,"" he wrote in a letter home. ""I simply dread going to bed because I get hit all night long.""

He later called it ""Colditz in kilts"" adding: ""[it was] a prison, the worst place on earth, pure torture. I hated every minute of it.""

It may explain why Charles is still famously quick to temper (Who can forget the the fountain pen incident last year?); he demands the respect that should have always been shown to him by his peers.

It may also be why Charles has repeatedly rebelled against protocol to ensure his voice is heard. He famously wrote no less than 27 letters to Labour ministers in one year, including lobbying David Blunkett to resurrect grammar schools and the then environment minister Michael Meacher to ban GM crops.

According to bestselling author of The King, Christopher Andersen [CORR], Charles once said: ""It seems strange to me that I, of all people ""” someone who might actually be in a position to make a difference - should have no opinions and should shut up. Well, I do ""” and I won't.""

Will, as Andersen predicts, Charles be ""a much noisier"" monarch, ""prodding, needling, and debating with his prime minister during their weekly sessions""?

It would make sense. He has been listening and learning about his people for decades.

On leaving active service, in 1976, after five years in the Royal Navy, Charles said: ""My great problem is I do not know what my role in life is...I must find one"" His causes, primarily The Prince's Trust, gave him that focus, and a much broader and more diverse understanding of his British people than his mum would have had at just 26.

Bullying aside, you don't need a pyschology degree to see how else The King's childhood will shape his reign.

It's why Charles made decisions, such as marrying the virginal Diana, in a desperate bid to win his parents' approval. And why he was so concerned by opinion polls - and so bitterly jealous at playing second fiddle to Diana in the public's affections. He needed to feel he came first in someone's priorities - be it the public's, or, as it would finally come to be, wife Camilla's.

""I can never remember my father ever telling me he loved me,"" Prince Charles, once said of Phillip's pragmatic nature. ""I can never remember him praising me for anything. I can never remember him putting his arms around me or giving me a hug. It was all very sad.""

It explains why, in his younger years, Charles found himself influenced by a number of other powerful men. Mountbatten urged him to play the field and not settle down until his 30s - Charles subsequently became the ""world's most eligible bachelor"" driving fast cars and sowing his oats right across blue-bloodied society (incuding three sets of sisters).

Mountbatten's shocking 1979 death in an IRA bomb attack left a huge scar. ""Agony, disbelief, a kind of wretched numbness swept over me,"" Charles would later recall. ""I felt powerless"".

But it drove him to be a more hands-on dad with his ""darling boys"" William and Harry - breaking tradition to be there for the births, and insisting on tucking them in bed and kissing them goodnight even as adolescents. (Although, as we all now know, according to Harry's book Spare, Charles wasn't faultless).

It may also be why, as King, he's now refusing to cut Harry out completely.

It marked a slight relaxing of the monarchy's stiff upper lip, much like when the royals openly cried at The Queen's funeral last year, instead of stifling emotions.

""Charles is an emotional man, he does feel things deeply,"" said longtime friend of Camilla's, socialite Basia Briggs. ""He will be a magnificent king. He cares for everyone and has a kind heart.""

Charles' biggest lesson about the danger of the ""˜stiff upper lip' philosophy, came in the wake of Princess Diana's death. He woke the boys, during their family holiday in Balmoral to break the news, but then went along with The Firm's well-meant but ill-advised plan to keep calm and carry on - by going the local church as normal that morning (Harry was so confused he asked ""Are you sure mummy is dead?"").

He finally took his first big stand against The Firm, when he begged The Queen to break protocol, and make a TV statement about his ex-wife.

The King would soon stand up to the institution again - for love. In terms of moments that have shaped our monarch, none were greater than in 1971, when polo groupie Camilla Shand hooked him with the line: ""My great-grandmother and your great-great-grandfather were lovers. So how about it?""

In Camilla, Charles found a best friend, and ultimately his Queen.

""What Charles lacked, despite his certain destiny, was domestic security, someone who could make him feel whole, someone who could compensate for his disjointed childhood,"" explains Tess Dunlop. ""It turns out Camilla was that woman.""

Now with her at his side, after 70 years of worried waiting, King Charles is secure in the knowledge he's beloved not just by Camilla, but by the nation.

British cities would be massively impacted by a mega-tsunami caused by a landslide in the Canary Islands, a leading British scientist has warned. Cities on the south coast with a combined population in the millions would be in danger

A scientist is warning of a future massive tsunami that could crash onto the shores of Britain in a rare geological event.

Former Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK government, Sir David King, warned that a huge tsunami could thunder onto British shores at any time in the next 10,000 years.

Generally speaking, Brits are somewhat sheltered from the world's biggest natural disasters like huge earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and tsunamis.

However, Sir David says a huge wave could be triggered by a ""mass of rock the size of the Isle of Man"" falling into the Atlantic Ocean from a huge landslide in the Canary Islands.

Sir David warned: ""After the landslide in the Canary Islands, it would take roughly six hours for the wave to reach the UK.""

Britain's south coast would take the brunt of the force and the cities likely to be affected by the mega waves are as follows...

Sir David told MyLondon: ""That might sound like a long time to give people to escape, but there are other places where people had longer to flee yet many people still died.

""What would happen in London is that everyone would get into their cars all at once to escape the city and they'd block all the roads. People wouldn't be able to get out in time and they would essentially die in their cars.""

Other large towns and cities on the south coast can also expect to be impacted should the freak disaster ever occur and Britain's capital may be in a uniquely worrying position.

Shallow waters in the Thames Estuary could cause the wave to back up and increase in size.

""In the case of tsunamis, the shallower the waters are, the larger the wave will get,"" Sir David said. ""Once the tsunami passes through the English Channel and into the Thames Estuary, it will grow in size and cause all sorts of destruction in the city.""

Though unlikely, King said that ""it could happen in 10,000 years' time, but it could also happen tomorrow"".

King, a former Professor of Chemistry at the University of East Anglia, drew comparisons with a near 10-metre wave that smacked into the Portuguese capital of Lisbon in 1755, killing around 100,000 people.

The long-term effects of the disaster wouldn't just be damage to buildings and thousands killed in the initial moments of the tsunami making landfall, but salty water damaging lands.

King added: ""Saltwater coming in from the sea could contaminate some freshwater reserves."" He added: ""There would be some ecological damage to wildlife too.

""On that note, the salt water would also saturate the soil around London. The change in salinity levels would mean farmers wouldn't be able to grow crops in the area for many years afterwards, as has been seen in other tsunami-affected regions.""

How likely the landslide is has been debated by scientists.

There is a theory that an eruption in the Canary Islands could cause the mega-tsunami, which would also dramatically impact areas as far away as the American east coast.

The US Geological Survey (USGS) said that ""ocean floor mapping surrounding the Canary Islands... indicates that collapses instead occur in incremental or piecemeal fashion"".

This goes against the idea that a massive landslide would happen all at once, generating the force needed for a massive wave.

Miniature dachshund Cola left owners Ella and Richard Derkacz heartbroken after suddenly vanishing but the nine-year-old was in danger - and it needed a rescue drone to save her from a cliff plunge

A sausage dog which plunged 120 feet off a cliff was rescued by a drone operator after spending more than two days stuck on a tiny ledge.

Nine-year-old miniature dachshund Cola vanished on Tuesday when owner Ella Derkacz was walking her on a clifftop path.

And it was missing for more than 48 hours before a former Scotland Yard constable was drafted in to find the pooch.

Retired cop Phil James launched a drone in the sky and spotted poor Cola perched precariously on a ledge just over halfway down the clay cliff.

He went down to the beach and was able to scramble up the cliff to reach Cola and bring her back down to her relieved owners.

Mr James, 47, said: ""When I arrived the first thing I did was to get Ella to re-enact exactly where she was when Cola disappeared.

""She showed me the position where she had been taking pictures out to sea on the clifftop path and then looked down to see Cola had gone.

""Normally, her dog does not leave her side, but she convinced herself that she must have tried to make her own way back to her car.

""I could see a bit of flattened grass right by the edge of the cliff and it made me think she might have gone over. When I got the drone up, I could see Cola perched halfway down within a couple of minutes. She was alive and moving her head around.

""We all went to the beach and I decided it was safe enough to clamber up to get her. The first thing she did was growl at me, and I spent a few minutes getting close enough to her to put a lead on her harness.

""I checked her out provisionally and she was absolutely fine, so I slid down the cliff on my backside with her in my arms. Her owners were naturally overjoyed to be reunited with her.

""She was slightly dehydrated and needed some water, but had been suffering from exposure to the sea air with the sea salt starting to gunge up her eyes.

""Luckily she was slightly overweight and that must have helped her survive two nights in the open without anything to eat.""

Mrs Derkacz had paused to take a picture and was convinced the pet had got lost trying to find her way back to her car in a layby in Trimingham, Norfolk.

Local dog owner Joanne Ledger, 55, found Mrs Derkacz crying out for her missing dog and offered to help her organise a search.

Miss Ledger arranged social media appeals and around 60 local villagers turned out to look for Cola with Mrs Derkacz and her husband Richard over the next two days.

Five people with drones also joined the search along with a person who had an infrared camera, but no trace of Cola was found.
Fears for the little dog grew on Thursday morning when there was still no sign of her after a torrential thunderstorm on Wednesday evening.

Miss Ledger finally spotted a website for the charity Drone to Home which specialises in finding lost dogs.

The charity's founder Mr James, a former Metropolitan Police constable, drove for three hours from his home in Nottingham to join the search on Thursday evening.

As soon as he arrived at 6.30pm, he quizzed Polish-born Mrs Derkacz about where she had been when she last saw Cola.

After Cola was discovered she was checked over by a vet and found to have escaped with nothing more serious than some scratched paw pads.

She is now recovering with Mr and Mrs Derkacz at their home in nearby Mundesley.

Miss Ledger who lives on top of the cliff: ""My friend called me after finding Ella in a distraught state while looking for her dog.

""I came over and helped organise the search because Ella's English was not that good.

""She told me that Cola was really timid and might be in the woods. Someone said they thought they had heard some whining in the woods so that is where we started to look.

""My concern was that her harness might have snagged against something and she could have been trapped The owner put out food and left her jumper in the woods which had her scent on it to try and attract her pet.

""But unbeknown to everyone, she had actually gone down the cliff. I am so pleased that I found out about Drone to Home and contacted them.

""As Phil is a former police officer, he asked all the right questions and managed to find Cola by putting up his drone in the right spot. Everyone had been looking in the wrong place.

""The clay on the cliff had hardened because of the summer sun, so it was rock hard which meant that Phill was able to climb up and get her.

""It was just fantastic seeing her being rescued. I will never forget it. It was a very emotional moment and everyone was crying.

""It is incredible that Cola managed to sit so still and not move on such a tiny ledge.""

Three Konami revivals could be on the way to PlayStation, just not for anyone else.

Konami could be set to revive Metal Gear Solid, Castlevania, and Silent Hill as PlayStation exclusives if rumours are to be believed.

PlayStation owners could be in for a treat as reports have surfaced that three classic Konami series' may be returning exclusively to Sony's machine. While we've already known about Silent Hill 2's remake and subsequent PS5 exclusivity since last October's Silent Hill Transmission stream, the long-awaited revivals of Konami's flagship series' are yet to surface. But this latest wrinkle comes from a Tweet posted by Windows Central reporter Jez Corden.

A remake of PS2 title (and greatest game of all time if you ask me) Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater has been the most regularly reported rumour this side of a Bloodborne PC Port, with the latest word being that it could show up as early as Sony's rumoured PlayStation Showcase. Whereas a yet-unknown Castlevania revival has also been mentioned alongside the two remakes. These three revivals would mark Konami's return to AAA games development after the highly publicised falling out with Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima and shift away from console games in 2015 (and whatever Metal Gear Survive was meant to be).

It's unknown at this time if these projects are being outsourced like the Silent Hill 2 remake - which is being handled by Observer developer Bloober Team. With PlayStation Studios' own Bluepoint Games' (known for their excellent work remaking Shadow of the Colossus and Demon's Souls ) being one of the names thrown about as taking the helm on a Metal Gear Solid remake - which makes a little more sense if it is in fact a PlayStation Exclusive. Although an equally popular rumour is that the developers of the Nier: Automata The End of Yorha Edition port on Nintendo Switch - Virtuos - could be handling the re-telling of Big Boss' formative years.

What a thrill...

When rumours first started cropping up that a Metal Gear Solid remake was in the works, I was ecstatic, the PS1 classic, while still great today, could do with a tune up. However, when word shifted that it would actually be a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3 - my single favourite game ever made - that excitement turned to fear. Truth be told, I don't have much faith in current-day Konami - whose output since Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain has been football games, retro collections, and extremely mid Bomberman titles - to not mess this up.

Even though I felt similarly, and was subsequently proven wrong about the Resident Evil 4 remake, Capcom has been on a roll in recent years, whereas Konami is a total gamble. I sincerely hope that in a years time (or whenever this remake comes out) I can look back and laugh at this... and oh yeah a new Castlevania that is a Soulslike would be pretty cool too.

Unisex baby names have gone up a whopping 56% in England and Wales with one girl's name becoming increasingly popular. And that's not the only trend we're set to see this year...

There has been a huge increase in unisex baby names in recent years. Many celebrity parents, including the Kardashians, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, and Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, have opted for unisex names for their little ones - and the rest of us seem to be following suit.

In England and Wales, the number of names considered unisex has increased by a whopping 56%, with new parents opting for gender-neutral baby names that are inclusive while still being nonspecific.

Sophie Kihm, name expert at Nameberry, told the Metro: ""Gender neutral names are rising both because they give children flexibility should they not identify with their birth gender, but also because gender neutral names are modern choices with contemporary style.""

So what are the fastest-rising unisex names in England and Wales? Top of the list for girls is Marlowe, which has moved up 266 spots from 2020-21. The name - spelt without the 'e' - also made it onto the boys' top 1,000 for the first time. Noa also appears on both lists, up 190 spots for girls.

Other names on the girls' list include Oakley, up 249 spots, and Blair and Ronnie, which are both new to the Top 1,000. The boys' list, meanwhile, features Ren and Ocean, also both new to the Top 1,000, and Sunny, which is up 195 places.

And it's not just gender-neutral names on the rise. Disney-themed names could also become incredibly popular with parents this year, according to Sarah Redshaw, the UK Managing Editor for BabyCentre.

She told the Mirror: ""It's a possibility that parents may take the lead from celebrities and their recent Disney-inspired names. Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury named their newborn daughter Bambi, and Stacey Dooley called hers Minnie so we could see an increase in searches for Disney names.""

Another unexpected trend seems to be wild west-inspired names. Sarah claims this is a move that none of the baby name experts ever saw coming, but it seems expectant parents just can't stop searching their website for monikers that would be fit for a little cowgirl or cowboy.

As such BabyCentre believes we can expect to see more babies named Billy, Butch, Wyatt, Pearl, Daisy and Clementine being welcomed into the world over the coming months. The experts went on to claim that outer space names will also dazzle parents, with Apollo, Cosmo, Ariel and Luna all being good options.

Other trends you may see cropping up in 2023 include gemstone names like Ruby and Jet as well as old-fashioned and classy-sounding names such as Tybalt, Tamara and Barnaby.

WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES: The two-headed black and white calf was born alive to a stunned farmer in Turkey, as a local vet said the rare mutation in the cow could have been caused by pollution

A rare two-headed cow born to a herd in Turkey has been shown off to the world by an amazed farmer.

The black and white calf was delivered alive at a farm in Tokat, Anatolia region, reported local media. Photos of the calf show its clearly defined two heads, which each have a pair of eyes and a mouth, but they appeared to be fused at one side of the jawbones. Sadly, the calf died within an hour of being born.

Cattleman Rustem Kahraman, who raises cattle full-time on his farm, told local media: ""For the first time in my life, I encountered such a situation, and I am very surprised.""

Villagers who heard about the rare birth flocked to Kahraman's barn to see the animal. Local vets said it was unclear what caused the mutation, but said it would most likely either genetic or environmental - most likely as a result of pollution. As a result, the the embryo had not developed properly inside the mother cow, causing the unusual development of the animal.

The event sparked varied responses among local people, with discussions of how the two-headed cow came to be even veering into a religious debate. A Facebook user commented: ""That's an example of how God is capable of anything"", while another wrote: ""God would create animals with two heads already if they meant to have two heads. This has nothing to do with God, but men, who feed those animals with genetically modified crops.""

Earlier this year, an experienced farmer in the US was given a huge shock when she realised that one of her cows had struggled through labour because she was giving birth to a two-headed mutant calf. The one in 2,500 anomaly baffled Leslie Hunewill who was watching over the cows at the family ranch in the US state of Nevada.

She noticed a heifer about to deliver its first calf but it soon became clear the animal was struggling. Ms Hinewill, 38, said: ""Examining her, a head and the front legs were in the birth canal and the calf did not feel too large for the heifer to birth on her own, so it was puzzling why she was having difficulty.

After falling in love with a baby elephant during a backpacking trip in Asia, Katherine Connor now runs a bustling wildlife sanctuary in Thailand - while also raising five children

Every day Katherine Connor is up at 5am getting breakfast ready... but not for her five children.

They're still fast asleep while she feeds her 10 rescue dogs, 15 cats and the family rabbit. Then she gets ready to tend to a few of her larger babies - a herd of 10 vulnerable elephants.

By the time mum has breakfast on the table for Hope, 15, Noah, 13, Aaron, 11, Ethan, nine, and Luke, eight, their chatter across the cereal and toast is punctuated by rumbles, snorts and the occasional trumpeting outside. ""There have been moments where I've been feeding a baby in my lap, with a dog beside me, and an elephant has come over to say hello,"" says Katherine, 42. ""It's just like The Jungle Book. The elephants are our family. I've lived with them more than half my life and they still make me laugh and cry every day.""

Animals and humans all live in harmony together at Boon Lott Elephant Sanctuary (BLES) in Sukhothai, Thailand, which was set up by Katherine and her late husband Anon in 2008. It's named after a baby elephant she fell head over heels with on a visit to a Thai conservation centre while backpacking across Asia at the age of 21.

""Boon Lott had thick red hair and huge eyes. He came over, lifted his trunk and blew hard into my face,"" she says. ""I thought, ""˜Wow, I have just interacted with an elephant.'""

Katherine, raised in South Woodford, East London, was so smitten she returned the next day and ended up having tea with the director, who invited her to volunteer for a month. She says: ""We were talking about Boon Lott and the director said, ""˜There's something different about you - you've been chosen'.""

It was the start of an adventure that turned into an astonishing rescue mission. Katherine decided to devote her life to the endangered animals - and has so far helped save the lives of 30 elephants through BLES, with many returned to the wild. ""We've taken in elephants with broken legs, covered in scars from where they've been shackled up, blind, and emotionally scarred with behavioural issues,"" she says. ""One called Pang Dow was so badly abused she was severely deformed and covered in blood.

""At first, we couldn't even touch her. It took months of trust-building for her to realise we wouldn't hurt her. Now she's a powerhouse. Always trumping and roaring. She climbs mountains, swims and walks several kilometres a day.""

And the woman who saved her is a powerhouse herself. So devoted to elephants and protective of their welfare that she is campaigning to ban tourist firms from advertising them to sell holidays. Katherine admits hers is a hard, but wonderful life. ""We frequently have power cuts, days without running water, no air-conditioning and the house is crumbling,"" she says. ""But it's filled with love and laughter.""

After feeding her entire two-legged and four-legged brood, at around 7am the kids pile into the Jeep as Katherine's partner, kickboxing instructor Kru Sing who she met at a tiny gym in the nearby village, drives them to school. Then the day begins in earnest for Katherine - rescuing and protecting the animals from exploitation for tourism, giving them care and sanctuary and teaching them to fend for themselves.

Surrounded by thousands of acres of forest land, once well they are free to roam and live as wild animals again. But for now, three especially needy female elephants require daily medical treatments which take about an hour-and-a-half to administer. One stood on a land mine - a legacy of Thailand's old wars with neighbouring countries - and another has deformities from forced breeding and mistreatment.

Katherine and her team then spend three hours roaming the forest, checking their other elephants that are in better condition as they browse on leaves, vines, trees and grass, supplemented by BLES crops like corn, sugarcane, apples, bananas and pumpkins. ""We make sure they're relearning natural behaviours - foraging, grazing, eating natural food and dusting themselves down,"" says Katherine.

""They need to take care of themselves and not rely on us."" Katherine's Jungle Book existence is a far cry from her suburban upbringing here, where her dream of being a pro dancer ended at 17 when she damaged an ankle. But she says she was always finding squirrels with broken legs to help or rescuing baby birds. On her 21st birthday - then engaged and in a managerial job - she felt her life was lacking adventure.

So she left her fiancÃ© behind to go backpacking for a year, travelling to Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, before landing in Thailand and seeing her first elephants. ""As soon as my feet touched Thai soil, I felt I was home,"" says Katherine, who hasn't been back to the UK in 13 years, although her parents come to visit her.

She says she was aghast when she saw elephants performing for tourists. ""I'd see them dancing, wearing ribbons, painted, in shackles with puncture marks all over their heads."" It led to her visit to the conservation centre and her meeting with baby Boon Lott. Her month of volunteering stretched to two-and-a-half years.

She lived in a bamboo hut with the elephant handlers, taught herself to speak Thai, and learned to care for the magnificent creatures. But when Boon Lott was paralysed after falling down a hill a few months in, she was devastated.

For 14 months, Katherine fought to save him - swimming with him daily and raising funds for a sling to try to help him stand. When he had another accident, with no hope of recovery, she was heartbroken. ""I lay on the floor with him in my lap, my arms wrapped around him, with us both crying,"" she says. ""He was my baby, my first son.

""I told him ""˜I'm not sure how, but I'm going to fight and I'm going to do it for you'."" With the help of her friend Anon she started building her own elephant sanctuary named after Boon Lott.

It opened in 2008 with two elephants. Katherine and Anon then married and had first child Hope. The couple split in 2014 after their youngest son was born. She says the herd gave her strength to cope with the break-up and then Anon's death in an accident in 2019, leaving their children without a dad.

""It was hard and lonely being a single mum in a culture that wasn't my own,"" she admits. ""But my children and the elephants have been there for me. I've carried all my children on every elephant walk up until they started school.

""I have memories of sitting on the ground breastfeeding them all with an elephant standing over, protecting me.

""The children used to call our elderly elephant, Pang Fai, their ""˜granny.'""

Now happily settled with Kru, she says: ""He's a real-life superman. He loves the children and the elephants and helps with everything. When the kids get in from school, they help with poop scooping and tidying enclosures. If an elephant is sick, they will help me nurse them all night long if needed.""

Now in her third decade in Thailand, Katherine has no regrets. She says: ""When Boon Lott blew into my face, he blew into my soul.""

Tortured for tourism

KATHERINE is campaigning with charity Save The Asian Elephants (STAE) for a law to stop UK holiday firms advertising holidays and activities involving cruelty and exploitation of wild animals.

The Animals (Low-Welfare Activities Abroad) Bill will make it unlawful to advertise activities abroad if illegal in the UK. STAE has found more than 1,200 UK travel firms advertising nearly 300 venues where it claims elephants are exploited after being cruelly ""broken in"" for tourism. Charity chief Duncan McNair says: ""Asian baby elephants are snatched from their mother who is usually killed in front of them along with others in the herd who try to protect them.

""The terrified babies are starved, dehydrated, kept awake, beaten, stabbed, and sometimes set on fire to break their spirits for easy use in tourism. The bill will save them.""

A world first, the bill reaches committee stage in Parliament on Tuesday. Go to stae.org.

Man of Steel director Zack Snyder is back with an epic space opera forty years in the making.

Tasked with finding fighters who would risk their lives to defend the people of Veldt, Kora and Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), a tenderhearted farmer naive in the realities of war, journey to different worlds in search of the Bloodaxes, and assemble a small band of warriors who share a common need for redemption along the way.

Chataraboina Narsavva was at home when a mob of monkeys ambushed her leaving her with multiple injuries - she later died in hospital due to the attack in Telangana's Kamareddy district, India

A 70-year old woman has died after being attacked by a pack of monkeys while in her own home.

The mob of monkeys ambushed Chataraboina Narsavva when they pounced on her in southern India in the state of Telangana's Kamareddy district.

Chataraboina, who was a pensioner, lived with her daughter in Ramareddy village, she was alone at the time of the attack.

Her daughter, who was away for a wedding, later hurriedly transported her mother to a hospital, where she ultimately succumbed to her injuries.

Authorities dismissed the notion that Narsavva was attacked by animals and stated that she slipped and fell, striking her head on the ground.

But they admitted she sustained the injuries which she later died from as she tried to escape the mob of monkeys.

Narsavva had not been bitten by the monkeys during the attack.

Police said: ""We have come to know through locals that when the monkeys attacked her, she tried to escape.

""In the process, she slipped and fell down. She suffered a head injury and died.""

Narsavva's family cremated her soon after her death and police are continuing to investigate.

The fatal attack is just the latest in a long line of monkey-related tragedies in India, which is home to millions of primates.

Last year, a man had tragically died after falling from the roof of his house, as he was attacked by a violent gang of mad monkeys.

The 52-year-old farmer attempted to escape from the troop of monkeys in the district of Budaun in India.

Horilal was the roof of his home in the village of Kadarchowk when the angry primates charged towards him.

He tried to escape the unsolicited attack, but tragically plunged from the roof in the attempt.

It has been reported that victim lived alone, while his two sons lived in Delhi.

Speaking of the horror attack, a relative of the victim said: ""Horilal died because of monkeys.

""The Government should do something about it. There are over 100 monkeys who target our houses and crops every day.""

Monkey attacks are on the rise, with a spate of violent incidents.

In June 2022, more than 50 people were injured when the mammal set upon residents of three villages in Swarupnagar, Kolkata.

In 2021, it was reported that the violent monkeys caused horrific attacks on other animals.

The ferocious primates killed 250 dogs, after dragging them to the tops of buildings and trees before dropping them to the ground below.

A separate attack in 2020 saw a 13-year-old girl die after she fell from a roof while monkeys chased her.

Prince Harry uses many affectionate nicknames and cryptic codenames to describe family members, staff and even paparazzi in Spare - but some of them are not fully explained

Sometimes it can feel like a game of Guess Who when reading Prince Harry's new book.

In his highly-anticipated autobiography Spare, the Duke of Sussex uses secret nicknames and codenames when referring to certain people.

Some of them are incredibly obvious, such as Granny for his grandmother, the late Queen, or Meg and Lili for wife Meghan Markle and daughter Lilibet.

However, there are a number of cryptic names that need a bit more knowledge to decipher - and some of them are not very nice.

The Other Woman

Harry doesn't hold back on his dislike for 'the Other Woman'.

Towards the start of the book, Harry explains what life was like after his mother, Princess Diana, died and how his father, King Charles, began to move on.

Harry says he sensed the presence of 'the Other Woman', and that his brother, Prince William, long harboured suspicions about her which confused and tormented him.

""With mummy missing, Pa was free to see the Other Woman openly and as often as he liked,"" writes Harry.

After using the phrase four times in half a page, Harry finally reveals that 'the Other Woman' is in fact Queen Consort Camilla.

She doesn't get a good assessment in the book, with Harry claiming his ""wicked stepmother"" would throw people under the bus to sit on the throne and turned his bedroom into her dressing room.

Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber

Harry frequently criticises the actions of the paparazzi in Spare - and has nicknames for two of his most frequent pursuers.

Dubbing them Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber, Harry says he would always pick the two paps out of the crowd and they were the most determined to get photos of him.

Harry recalls one incident while he was leaving a club where they caused a security scare as someone thought they were holding a gun.

His security guard, Billy the Rock, sprang into action - but Harry recognised the culprit.

""Billy the Rock leapt forward, hand on his gun, and nearly shot the two men. But it was just Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber... Billy held him and screamed into his face,"" writes Harry.

The Bee, The Fly and The Wasp

They sound like they could be a new superhero organisation, but they are in fact a group of powerful advisors to the senior royals.

Harry says they sorted the advisors into zoological categories, with The Bee being codename for the late Queen's private secretary, Sir Edward Young, according to The Times.

The Wasp is believed to be King Charles' private secretary, Clive Alderton, while The Fly is reportedly Prince William's, Simon Case.

In the book, Harry explains that the three ""middle-aged white men"" who had consolidated power ""through a series of bold Machiavellian manoeuvres"".

He describes the Bee as oval-faced and fuzzy, the Fly as someone who was ""drawn to s***"" and said the Wasp would ""stab you with his outsized stinger"".

Calling them ""usurpers"", Harry adds: ""Deep down, I feared that each man felt himself to be the One True Monarch, that each was taking advantage of a Queen in her nineties, enjoying his influential position while merely appearing to serve.""

According to Harry, the Bee was sent to help him and Meghan deal with their issues, but after a meeting where he wrote down meticulous notes they never heard from him again.

Exactly the same thing is alleged to have happened when the Wasp claimed he would help them out.

Pa

Harry doesn't refer to King Charles as father, dad or even daddy.

Instead he uses the affectionate Pa, which is also how Archie refers to his grandfather.

King Charles obviously crops up a lot in the book, with Harry writing about the night his father told him that his mother had died and how he did not hug him.

Harry also speaks about Charles trying to keep peace between his sons and the night he first met Meghan.

Billy the Rock

Frequently mentioned in the book is Billy the Rock.

The private bodyguard looked after Harry for many years and once saved him from Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber.

It's also reported that Bill the Rock stopped a drunken Harry from getting a tattoo during his trip to Las Vegas in 2012.

They are close companions but Harry did once start a fight with Billy when he was upset, but the bodyguard barely reacted.

His actual name is never revealed in Spare.

Willy

One person who doesn't come out of Spare very well is Willy, better known as Prince William.

Harry revealed the nickname he has for his older brother in the book, which he uses throughout.

The heir to the throne is actually only referred to as William on nine occasions, as opposed to the 349 times he is called Willy.

Harry discusses being told by William to pretend he didn't know him at Eton, having a physical altercation at his home and his brother's lack of hair.

Harold

William also has his own special nickname he uses for his brother - Harold.

Meghan and most of Harry's mates call him Haz or even Spike, but William had his own name for his younger sibling.

The irony is that Harry's name isn't even Harry, it's actually Henry.

Aunt Margo

Harry briefly mentions Aunt Margo, who is in fact Princess Margaret, the late Queen's younger sister.

Despite feeling like they could have boded over being a 'spare', the Duke says his great-aunt was almost a ""total stranger"" to him.

In one hilarious section, Harry describes one Christmas at Sandringham where he received a very strange gift from Aunt Margo.

Margaret bought him a biro pen with a small rubber fish wrapped around it, which he saw as ""cold-blooded"".

Tiggy

William and Harry's former nanny Alexandra Pettifer, is better known as Tiggy Legge-Bourke.

Tiggy was the boys' favourite nanny and Charles' personal assistant from 1993 to 1999, but Harry does admit that his mother was not a fan.

He believes Diana saw Tiggy as a rival and suspected she was being groomed to be her replacement.

Harry also reveals that Tiggy was one of the loved ones who chastised him for doing the bombshell Oprah Winfrey interview in 2021.

Marko

Mark Dyer, known in the book as Marko, was a royal aide and trusted protector of Prince Harry.

Seen by the young prince as a 'second dad', he regularly pops up in stories during Harry's teenage years.

Harry looked up to Marko as a mentor and respected him for being ""an extreme ginger and owning it"".

King Charles tasked the aide with looking after his youngest son - with Marko taking Harry to Botswana when he was a boy.

The royal household sent Marko to give Harry a telling off when he was drug-taking at Eton - and the prince hilariously revealed the story of how he lost his virginity to an older woman in a field to him.

Gan-Gan

Harry's great-grandmother, the Queen Mother, is referred to as Gan-Gan.

The Duke remembers her growing weak and recalls the moment he discovered the Queen Mother had died in March 2002.

He goes into detail about the ""bright and warm"" weather at his school in Eton when he took the dreaded ""phone call"".

But reports from the time say that the prince, who was 17 at the time, wasn't even in the UK and was away skiing in snowy Switzerland with his father and brother.

A statement from the King at the time says he planned to return to the UK as soon as possible - and Harry was photographed returning back a day later.

The nickname went down the generations as William's children all referred to the late Queen as ""Gan-Gan"".

Henners

When Harry wasn't roaming the school corridors, he was hanging out in the grounds with best pal Henners.

The two chums were actually both called Henry, but Henners got his nickname and he referred to Harry as Haz.

The three van Straubenzee boys - Henry, Thomas and Charlie - were some of Harry's closest childhood friends.

In the book, Harry says Henners was skinny with no muscles and hair that stood on end but he was ""all heart"".

He recalls eating strawberries in a farm by the school grounds and they were once caught literally red-handed by a teacher due to their crimson palms.

Sadly, Henners passed away in a tragic car accident in 2002 aged 18, a passenger in the car that drove into a tree when leaving a party.

Spare: by Prince Harry - where to get your hands on a copy

Retired farmer Walter Renwick, 69, has been evicted from his home at at Plankey Mill, Northumberland, after losing a long-running legal battle with the Jesuits in Britain,

A retired farmer has been evicted from the home he has lived in all his life in Northumberland after losing a long-running legal battle with the landowners.

Walter Renwick, 69, was born at Plankey Mill and is a well-known face to visitors at the popular beauty spot, near Hexham, where he ran a campsite. But now the Jesuits in Britain, who own the land, have said they took possession of the property on Thursday, September 21.

And to make matters worse he is now furiously denying claims that he was involved in the cutting down of the Sycamore Gap tree that was felled last Wednesday. He insists he has wrongly been named on social media as the culprit of the mindless vandalism.

Walter was served with an eviction notice earlier this year and was initially told to leave the farm by July 11. He was then granted a 28-day reprieve from eviction after the pensioner took his fight to Carlisle County Court but has now been made to leave with the Jesuits in Britain taking the land.

A spokesman for Jesuits in Britain said: ""The Jesuits in Britain can confirm that they have re-taken possession of the property and land at Plankey Mill, which is owned by them. A full examination of the physical state of the property will now take place. The Jesuits wish the previous leaseholder well.""

The religious order says the original lease was legally held by Walter's father and after his death they extended the lease to allow Walter time to find a new home. The last lease extension ran out in 2021 and the Jesuits were then granted a court order to have Walter evicted, it is claimed.

Walter previously told ChronicleLive the battle had ""broken a proud man"", adding: ""I was born here. It is like a tree with roots. You know when your roots are here, everything has been put here: my dogs, my rabbits when I was a kid. Every memory I had as a kid, the football, the games when you were a kid when all the campers came. Happiness, there is no happiness now. Happiness is gone.""

The Jesuits said many people denouncing the repossession have based their objections on the fact Walter has been running a paid-for campsite on fields adjacent to the property. They said the campsite was never allowed under the terms of the lease, and did not have planning permission from the local authority but they never took action on this point.

But over a number of years, the Jesuits say they have received complaints from both the local council and the National Trust, who own an adjacent property, about the ""antisocial behaviour of several campers, especially during the pandemic in 2020"".

Northumberland County Council bosses said they received a complaint in 2020 regarding an unauthorised campsite on Plankey Mill Farm but because it was more than 10 years old it did not require planning permission.

Meanwhile, police have said they have arrested a man in his 60s in connection with the Sycamore Gap tree felling incident and Walter admits he understood why some people may have thought it was him as he has spent his entire career felling trees, The Sun reports.

But although he was evicted last week from the home he grew up in near the scene of the crime, he vehemently denies being connected to the felling of the 70-foot 'Robin Hood Tree', adding: ""I didn't do it."" Walter said: ""I am a former lumberjack and I have just been kicked off my property, so I can see why people have pointed the finger. My brother came down to make sure I hadn't been arrested as he had heard the rumours. It's very sad. It's an iconic tree.""

Clive Owen has announced he is stepping back from his Channel 5 spin off to Our Yorkshire Farm as his son Reuben 'doesn't want me on his hands' following Amanda split

Clive Owen has quit his spinoff show to Our Yorkshire Farm, as he admits his son Reuben ""doesn't want me on his hands"".

The TV farmer starred in Beyond The Yorkshire Farm following the breakdown of his marriage to shepherdess Amanda Owen.

Clive had starred in three episodes of the spin off show alongside his eldest son Reuben.

The Channel 5 show was broadcast in December following the cancellation of Our Yorkshire Farm, which had shot Clive and Amanda to fame.

Clive has now revealed he is stepping back from the show, letting his son go it alone but hasn't ruled out future TV work.

""We've done this thing with Reuben, it's been great fun working with him. Cos he's crazy too, so we've had a grand time doing it,"" he said on Lorraine.

""I think I'm stepping back from that now. I think he's gonna go on on his own. Because he doesn't want me on his hands.

""So, I have no plans to do anything in particular, but you never know, someone might be daft enough to ask me.""

The programme followed Clive and Reuben as they set up a digging business in the Yorkshire Dales.

Despite Clive's announcement, Channel 5 are yet to announce a second series of the show.

The programme attracted 1.8M viewers and was a solid hit for the channel.

It massively outperformed Amanda Owen's new show, Farming Lives, which attracted about 600,000 viewers for More 4.

Clive has recently blamed Our Yorkshire Farm, for causing the pair to split.

He explained to Christine Lampard, who was standing in for Lorraine Kelly, that he struggled with jealousy and admits he handled the success of the show very badly, ""ranting, raving and drinking"".

""We filmed Our Yorkshire Farm, people loved it and it was an opportunity to make something as a family. That was what drove her. It was amazing and very successful but I handled it very badly,"" he admitted.

""It was such a change in our lives and I sadly made a right mess of things basically. I had a massive part to play in the relationship ending. A massive part to play. I was ranting and raving and drinking and carrying on. I don't know - jealousy.""

The Our Yorkshire Farm stars split last summer after 21 years together and share nine children.

It has recently been reported that Amanda has subsequently moved on with businessman Robert Davies, who she has known for five years.

Comments regarding Will Young's sexuality arose during the farmer's time in Love Island, with the TikTok sensation now addressing the rumours during a chat with the Mirror alongside girlfriend Jessie Wynter

Love Island' s Will Young has addressed the rumours regarding his sexuality and vowed never to change.

The reality TV star, who appeared on this year's winter series of the ITV2 show, says he was 100% himself in the South African villa and vows never to change for anyone.

Speaking exclusively to the Mirror, the TikTok farmer proudly states how he supports the LGBTQ+ community, as his brother is gay, and clarifies he is happy in his relationship with Aussie Jessie Wynter.

Thanks to his vibrant personality and eye-catching dance moves, Will's sexuality became the subject of speculation throughout his time in the villa earlier this year, but the loved-up star isn't too bothered by other people's comments.

""I was 100% myself in the villa. I'm happy with myself and I'm happy with Jessie,"" Will tells the Mirror.

""My brother is gay, and so I'm all for it. I don't think anyone can say that to me in a negative way. As a person I'm very outgoing and charismatic, and I'm not going to change.""

Jessie, 26, clearly feels the same as her new beau, adding: ""It's 2023 and judging people's sexuality is outdated and needs to get out of the window.""

Will and Jessie narrowly missed out on a place in the Love Island final earlier this month - being sent home just one day before the big occasion thanks to a public vote.

Instead of returning home to Tasmania, personal trainer Jessie flew back to Buckinghamshire with Will after they were booted out of the villa.

""We've been having an absolute blast. We've got me to the farm, we've got back to the country,"" Jessie says when chatting about her time in the UK with Will.

""We went to Tesco for our first date - we did the big shop, picked up some snacks. Then we went to the village pub for steak and chips and a chicken burger. It was so nice to get out of the villa, and since we've left we've been a lot happier. We don't have people interfering in our relationship.""

Will and Jessie both seem keen to make their long-distance relationship work, with sheep farmer Will admitting after their Love Island exit: ""I think it's very fair to say I would go to Australia.

""A relationship is a two-way thing. It would be unfair for me to rely on Jessie moving here 100%. Australia has always been a place I'd like to go to and travel.""

Jeremy Clarkson's Diddly Squat Farm Shop is selling a large sourdough for £5.95 a pop, which is over 200% more expensive than a comparable loaf in Aldi

Jeremy Clarkson's Diddly Farm Squat Shop is over 200% more expensive for essential items than the nearest supermarket.

The shop - which reopened on February 10 to launch the second series of Clarkson's Farm - is reportedly selling a large loaf of sourdough bread for £5.95 a pop.

This is 274.21% more expensive than a comparable loaf costing £1.59 at Aldi supermarket, which is just a six minute drive away in nearby Chipping Norton.

Meanwhile, a box of eggs at Jeremy's shop is £3.20 which would cost £1.19 in Aldi.

But his milk - or ""˜cow juice' as he calls it - is £1.20 - only 1p more expensive than the same in the supermarket.

Of course, big brands have the advantage of selling to stores in bulk and there's no denying the work that goes into making farm produce.

But it will cost you a pretty penny and if you want to plump for a pot of pesto at Jeremy's you'll be parting with £7.99 compared to just 95p at the local supermarket.

Honey is also a lot more expensive at a whopping £15 compared to just 75p at the supermarket, according to research by the Evesham Journal.

Jeremy's Farm Shop reopened earlier this month after his comments about Meghan Markle sparked a global backlash.

The father-of-three, 62, suggested people 'throw excrement' at the duchess, who he said he dreamt of being 'paraded around the streets naked'.

The presenter shut the shop after many people, including his own daughter, condemned his comments.

However, as the second series of his farming adventures airs on Amazon this month, Jeremy flung open the farm shop's doors again.

Just 14 customers were seen visiting the shop, which is a far cry from the massive crowds and queues of cars, which flooded the farm last year.

But while visitor numbers were visibly down compared to previous years, the store has raised its prices.

The price hike comes after Jeremy called on the government to increase the prices of food as he believes its currently ""far too cheap"".

The former Top gear host made his comments in a a discussion about the farming industry, ahead of Clarkson's Farm returning for its new series on Amazon Prime.

Speaking out about difficulties the industry faces, Jeremy said that one issue for cereal farms like his is the increased cost of fertiliser, stating: ""Fertiliser is now costing £1,000 a tonne rather than £200 like last year.""

He added that farmers in various areas are experiencing a ""nightmare,"" before conceding he was in a more fortunate position as he has other ways of earning an income.

Starfield launched this week and the game will keep you busy for weeks. But the best way to explore the universe is at a high a level a possible and this XP trick will guarantee to get you there.

This Starfield XP exploit has the potential to net you as much as 20k XP per minute, but you'll need to lay the groundwork if you want to get to level 100 in as little as 20 minutes.

If you're not a stranger to Bethesda games, you'll be familiar with the dagger spamming exploit in The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim. This Starfield XP exploit is basically that but on a much larger scale. You'll want to look at prepping your ship so shipyard locations might come in handy because you're going to want a lot of storage capacity, and you can upgrade or buy new ships at the yards.

This method of farming Starfield XP involves setting up extraction and storage for specific minerals by building outposts, making time pass to fill up on them, and spam crafting an item that will give you the XP boost you're after. This is fully broken down in YouTuber Kibbles Gaming's 20 minute video, but we've crammed all the info into bitesize sections below for you.

This Starfield XP exploit is scalable so you can focus on more extraction and more storage, or start small and work your way up - whatever works for you. But the potential to boost your XP gains is there. You will need a decent amount of credit to do this trick, so be sure to check out the Starfield infinite money glitch to get a leg up before it's patched out.

Step 1: buy resources

Go to the UC Distribution Centre on Jemison in the Alpha Centauri system to buy the resources needed to kick things off. Speak to vendor Tseng and buy the following:

If anything on the list is unavailable, you can sit on a chair and wait for 24 hours. You'll need to do this anyway, as we're stocking up big time, and Kibbles Gaming recommends repeating this resting and purchasing cycle at least two to three times to save yourself the trouble of having to come back for more later on. But you can always revisit the vendor later on if need be. You can also make adaptive frames with iron and aluminium so you can always buy surplus of those minerals to craft them yourself.

Step 2: upgrade your ship

You can upgrade your ship at Starfield at shipyards and the objective is give it more cargo slots. Kibbles Gaming has a giant freighter on the go, but you don't need to go that hard. Conveniently, there's a shipyard on Jemison so head over there and get your ship kitted out to hold cargo. Bear in mind you'll be sacrificing mobility and interior space so I'd use this ship exclusively for this Starfield XP exploit and make sure it can carry at least a few thousand cargo.

It's advisable to store all of the resources you just bought aboard your ship, and you can keep coming back to fill it up. The Weight Lifting trait will also help you lug all this heavy stuff around so consider investing in that. And if you're a hoarder in Bethesda games, you'll likely want to invest in that anyway.

Step 3: mine Iron and aluminium for adaptive frame

We need to start extracting iron and aluminium next so you need to locate planets rich with these resources. Kibbles Gaming suggests Kurtz (Jemison's moon) for aluminium and Zamka (Olivas's moon) for iron. Both of these locations are in the Alpha Centauri star system. Zoom in on the planets or moons you've chosen and scan for resource locations. We want to head down and land on a spot full of the resource and make an outpost.

Now that an outpost has been established, we want to place extractors down to suck up the minerals we're after. You'll either have the basic version available, or if you've been doing research, you can use the more advanced variants. Extractors require tungsten, aluminium, and iron to build and need power to run. Put down around five to start off with, and then start placing solar arrays or wind turbines for the power needed for the extractors. There's no atmosphere on Kurtz of Zamka so you'll need solar arrays, but use whichever method works best for the planets you've chosen.

Next you need storage containers for the resources you're extracting, and they require aluminium, iron and an adaptive frame to construct. Again, you may have better variants depending on the research you've done. Put a whole bunch down and connect them to one another. Then connect your extractors to the storage containers and you've got a planet dedicated to mining aluminium.

The final touches are a transfer container that requires tungsten, lubricant, and iron, and a landing pad which you need zero wire, iron, adaptive frame, and beryllium to build. Attach your storage containers to your transfer container. Meanwhile, your ship should appear on the landing pad once it's built. Now you can transfer resources from the outpost to your ship's cargo hold.

It's also worth setting up an industrial workbench at outposts so you can craft anything you might need on the fly. Repeat these steps on Zamka - or your other planet of choice - so you have an iron mining planet all set up. Drop a chair down and rest so that your containers full up and then craft adaptive frame at your workbench. We'll need these to make storage in the later steps.

Step 4: setting up Starfield XP farming

Our next destination is the Rasalhague system and the planet Rasalhague 2 which is rich in nickel and cobalt. Of course, you can choose a different planet but those are the resources we need now. Kibbles Gaming suggests making an outpost in an area that straddles both nickel and cobalt deposits for efficient extraction of the two resources. You'll be able to choose a good spot once you've scanned.

Set up your extractors and power generators as usual, as well as storage containers and an industrialworkbench. Connect one set to nickel extractors and one set to your cobalt extractors. We don't need the landing pad or transfer container here. Bear in mind that if there are animals on the planet, you might want to set up some defences as the last step is going to involve a time transition, in case your equipment gets damaged and you won't be around for repairs.

Step 5: Starfield XP exploit time

Resource gathering in Starfield works off of UT (universal time) so waiting around on a chair on your mining planet isn't going to get the output we want. We have to travel to somewhere familiar to get the time transition we're after to make this Starfield XP exploit worthwhile. Head to the Sol star system where you'll find our very own solar system. It's next to Alpha Centauri. Land on Venus, which mimics the real thing to some extent, with one full rotation (a day) taking hundreds of days elsewhere. In this case, 24 local hours on Venus is equal to 2,400 hours UT.

Take a seat and wait for 24 hours - 100 days will pass on Rasalhague 2 in the meantime. Your extractors will have filled up your storage during this time. Revisit Rasalhague 2 (or your nickel/ cobalt planet) and your containers should be stuffed.

Use the industrial workbench to rustle up some of the isocentered magnet which need nickel and cobalt to build. Spam-make this item, producing 99 (the max available) at a time. You get 100XP every time you do this, so if you can do this process quickly, you'll be clocking up around 20k XP per minute.

A farmer has vowed to 'die in prison' rather than pay fines for knocking down a boundary wall he helped build more than 40 years ago - and says the council has made his life a 'living nightmare'

A grandad has sworn to ""die in prison"" rather than pay fines for demolishing a wall he helped build over 40 years ago.

Farmer Ron Knight, 88, says he has been in a ""living nightmare"" for six years since he received a planning enforcement notice from the council for removing part of a concrete wall to access his land.

He built the wall himself in 1973 - but when he took it down in 2017, he was told it was historic, in a conservation area and needed planning permission.

After missing the appeal deadline, the pensioner has been to court four times and accumulated thousands of pounds in fines he can't afford.

In October, a judge warned Ron that he would face 45 days in jail unless he rebuilt the wall and paid all fines. But Ron, whose pleas have been ignored, said he'd rather be jailed ""if it's the last thing he does"" than admit any wrongdoing. He expressed his frustration, saying: ""It is getting us all down. We are all sick and tired and fed up. It doesn't matter what we say, they don't take any notice.""

He added: ""Standing up for myself and being prepared to go to jail is the only way I can see to get anyone to see sense. If going to prison is the last thing I do on this earth, I will do it to stop this madness."" Ron, who moved to Milborne Port in 1957 and bought Cannon Court Farm with his two brothers around five years later, has found himself in a row with his neighbours. He claims they've 'blocked access' to his land and his 'right of way' through their own developments.

When he sold the farm to retire to Devon in 1990, he kept six acres of land and three acres of allotments. To maintain the area and stop it from becoming overgrown, he said he had no choice but to remove part of the wall. Somerset Council has defended its actions and refused to consider his retrospective application while enforcement action remains ongoing.

Ron added: ""Put politely, it's been a bloody nuisance. Six years now it's been going on. After we sold, we decided to keep six acres of land and some allotments. We had right of way to go through there - it was the only way to get into it. It was then blocked completely. I got two grandsons to help me take part of the wall down. We got the foundation out and made a gap so we could go out with the tractors and everything.

""I don't know who reported us to the council but I had letter to say we had broken the law by digging out a conservation area - I did not know anything about a conservation area and neither did my two brothers. Apparently the whole of Milborne Port was made one in 1988. We had rebuilt that wall in 1973. They tried to argue we had taken down a historic wall. But if it's a historic wall why was it not back exactly how it was before? It is two foot lower now than it was. It is just a flat piece of concrete.""

Ron, who has lived in Bampton, Devon, with his wife Jean, 81, since selling the farm, expressed his family's worries about possibly having to sell their home due to escalating costs. He further stated: ""My argument is that if that wall was ours in 1973, it is our wall now. Why are they kicking up such a fuss? All we did was take down a part to make an entrance into our property as we had no other way of getting in. I have been to court four times for it and been fined over £1k each time. I am now being taken to court again on 22 January but I have absolutely no intention of paying any fine. I would rather go to prison than pay it and I totally mean that.

""I am not paying it - why should I if it belongs to me. I don't care what they say or what they do. I told them that when I went to court. The judge looked up and said you have got to pay. But I am not paying £20 a month or whatever they ask for. I am not paying anything. I said you can do what you like - put me in prison for a couple of months. That person had no rights to cover that track. We had a right of way to that property for as long as we were there. I just thought it was nice to keep a bit for the family.""

Ron's daughter Linda Knight added: ""He bought the land in the 1950s and kept some back when it was sold - and that was one piece of it. The council was never interested in what he had done all those years ago until now. His case is it is his wall, why can't he do work on it. There was no planning needed when he built it in 1970s,"" said Linda. ""Apparently the rules changed, where in ten years prior it would not have been an issue but new regulations were built in.""

She added: ""How is he supposed to maintain it if he can not access it? It is eight foot high in places and needed access to keep it trimmed back. Without that it would be all overgrown. All correspondence goes to dad in Devon and he was served the enforcement notice in November 2017. He did not really understand what was going on. By the time we found out about it it was too late and he had lost the right to appeal,"" Linda explained.

""The council have declined to determine the application, despite us spending more than £3k preparing it, and getting a planning heritage statement alongside it. They confirmed it was not a 'historic wall' but this was not even looked at,"" she said. My dad is 88 and has his health problems. He's got a pacemaker and this is having health implications on him and my mum. He really stresses over it and it has been like a dark cloud hanging over us for the last six years,"" Linda shared.

Linda said the fines had reached £3,200 but they could not afford to pay it. ""They have got nothing, and my dad said he would be prepared to spend time in jail than pay it. The council said it won't come to that, but he is not paying the fine, so I don't know what is the alternative.""

""They just don't want to listen. It feels like victimisation. At the end of the day he took down part of a wall that belongs to him to attend to a piece of conservation land. Do they not want it looked after? How else did they think we could do that? It is about time they showed some heart and compassion.""

Somerset Council said it was in the public interest to continue pursuing the matter, stating that Mr Knight had caused ""unjustified harm"" to a protected local structure. A spokesman said: ""The retrospective planning application was asking for the same requirements as the enforcement notice. ""We have applied the expediency test and public interest test to each step of this case. We consider that the creation of the access, necessitating the demolition or removal of a wide section of the historic stonewall and associated engineering work to the land behind, fails to safeguard the established character of the conservation area and has caused unjustified harm to a designated heritage asset.""

538,"Eat turnips instead of tomatoes as shortages could last a MONTH, says Tory minister","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/food-shortages-could-last-month-29292422","Eat turnips instead of tomatoes as shortages could last a MONTH, says Tory minister

Environment Secretary Therese Coffey has come under fire after retailers including Tesco and Asda were forced to put limits on how much fresh produce customers could buy

Fruit and vegetable shortages could last another MONTH, a Tory cabinet member has said - amid calls for the government to call an emergency COBRA meeting about the crisis.

Environment Secretary Therese Coffey came under fire after retailers were forced to put limits on how much fresh produce customers could buy.

She told MPs that the situation is expected to last another ""two to four weeks"" and said officials had been locked in discussions with retailers.

In the meantime, the top Tory suggested people should eat turnips instead.

Morrisons and Asda announced on Tuesday that they will limit the number of certain fresh food items customers can purchase in their stores.

Aldi and Tesco followed suit yesterday by also imposing restrictions on some fruits and vegetables.

It comes as tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, raspberries and lettuces are in short supply.

The Lib Dems have called on the government to call a COBRA meeting as they desperately try to get a grip.

Troubled frontbencher Ms Coffey - who was also criticised for saying that people struggling to pay for food should work more hours - told MPs: ""I am led to believe by my officials after discussion with industry and retailers, we anticipate the situation will last about another two to four weeks.

""It is important that we try and make sure that we get alternative sourcing options. That is why the department has already been in discussion with the retailers.

""It is why there will be further discussions led by ministers as well, so that we can try and get over this and try and avoid similar situations in the future.

""Even if we cannot control the weather it is important that we try and make sure the supply continues to not be frustrated in quite the way it has been due to these unusual weather incidents.""

In a heated exchange in the Commons she was branded ""Calamity Coffey"" by her Labour counterpart after an ""outrageous display"" which saw her booed at the National Farmers Union (NFU) conference yesterday.

Ms Coffey has been criticised after a dismal display at the NFU conference which saw her say egg shortages were not caused by ""market failure"" and telling farmers ""we can't control the weather in Spain"".

Shadow environment secretary Jim McMahon told the Commons: ""Although there might have been differences about the impact and the scale of the impact, there was consensus. And the consensus was that the Environment Secretary had a pretty bad day at the office.

""Some describing it as a slow motion tractor crash; 'Calamity Coffey'. But either way and joking aside, it was an insult to the very foundation of our food security and hardworking British farmers.""

He added: ""Will the Environment Secretary, not the farming minister, use this opportunity to apologise for the outrageous display at the NFU conference in Birmingham yesterday?""

Environment minister Mark Spencer stepped in, telling Mr McMahon that Ms Coffey couldn't answer due to parliamentary procedure.

He added there had been ""robust exchanges"" with NFU members, adding that ministers would ""continue to work with the NFU"" and other groups who represent farmers.

Meanwhile a Tory MP suggested that seasonal eating would solve the shortage of tomatoes and other fruit and vegetables.

Selaine Saxby asked: ""I wonder if my right honourable friend agrees with me that actually the supermarkets are still importing far too many produce for us and that actually we should be eating more seasonally and supporting our own British farmers?

""And if we were actually to move to a seasonal line of eating, many of these problems would be avoided and that there are great food products available from local farmers at this time?""

Ms Coffey replied: ""It's important to make sure that we cherish the specialisms that we have in this country.

""A lot of people would be eating turnips right now rather than thinking necessarily about aspects of lettuce, and tomatoes and similar but I'm conscious that consumers want a year-round choice and that is what our supermarkets, food producers and growers around the world try to satisfy.""

Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine said: ""People are rightly alarmed about the chronic shortage of fruit and vegetables in our shops, but it seems the government has no urgent plan to fix it.

""This government has created chaos in the economy, an NHS on its knees, now they're responsible for worsening food shortages through their failure to back British farming.

""We need an urgent COBRA meeting, together with food experts, supermarkets and farmers, to hammer out an urgent solution to this crisis.

""Ministers cannot just sit on their hands while food supply chains across the country grind to a halt.""

The Prime Minister's spokesman last night said: ""We don't believe it's for us to tell people what they should or shouldn't buy. That's entirely a matter for them.

""I think what the Secretary of State was doing was setting out the importance of celebrating the produce that we grow here in the UK, but ultimately, it's for individuals to decide what foods they wish to buy.""

Aussie bombshell Jessie and farmer Will have been fan favourites, but tonight in the main villa he turns his attention to new bombshells Layla

Love Island's Will Young is set to infuriate viewers tonight as he cheats on Jessie in an explosive first look at Casa Amor carnage.

Jessie Wynter and farmer Will have been fan favourites since they first got together - but he will forget all about the Aussie bombshell as his head his turned by new girl Layla.

In scenes airing tonight, Will and newcomer Layla get to know each other on the terrace.

Layla tells Will: ""You shocked me.. You're more chatty than I thought you would be.""

Will admits: ""I feel like I gravitate to you.""

As the pair get chatting on the terrace, Will admits he seems to be ""gravitating"" towards her during their intimate chat on the terrace.

""Except you didn't pick me in the challenge, which I'm still fuming about,"" Will points out, referring to their kissing competition earlier in the day.

""You didn't pick me,"" she hits back. ""You kissed two girls and I wasn't one of them.""

""Really?"" Will says. ""Were you jealous?""

""Yes,"" Layla replies instantly.

He then leans in for a kiss...

As night falls, some Islanders choose to sleep outside. Who is sleeping under the stars and who is sharing a bed?

This comes after Love Island is reportedly set for a huge dumping of Islanders in the South African villa, as host Maya Jama flies back to preside over the major shake-up.

It is reported that the host will enter the villa today and oversee the recoupling following the chaos of Casa Amor and the introduction of 12 new stars.

The 28-year-old host has teased the highly anticipated Casa Amor recoupling could happen sooner than anticipated , as she was seen jetting back to South Africa.

The freshly minted face of Love Island posted a short video from her seat on the airplane as she partied on board with pals.

Maya let slip her plans to return to the villa during the live broadcast of the Brit Awards, as she spoke with host Mo Gilligan on the night.

A source told The Sun : ""The next Love Island recoupling is imminent and Maya will be personally overseeing proceedings.

""Filming of the recoupling will take place today and there are plenty of upsets expected.

""Casa Amor is one of the most disruptive and drama-filled parts of the show and producers expect this to be no different.""

The Casa Amor chaos is already well underway as both the new boys and new girls have entered the villas to meet the original cast members.

The ITV2 show aired the first full episode from Casa Amor on Monday evening, as the new bombshell arrivals joined their counterparts in the various villas.

It wasn't long before connections started to form between both the original cast and the bombshells looking for love, as multiple villa favourites appeared to turn their heads for the new Islanders.

*Love Island returns to ITV2 at 9pm tomorrow night and is available to stream on ITVX

Shoppers have been urged to return a sweet breakfast treat sold in UK supermarkets due to safety fears.

Chocolate-filled croissants made by St Pierre are being recalled 'due to the possible presence of mould'.

The packs of six pain au chocolat are sold at Sainsbury's, ASDA and Ocado for £2.

Brits have been warned to avoid eating them and instead return them for a refund.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued an alert warning shoppers to check the Best Before dates on their packs.

Products with one of the following Before Dates could contain mould and are unsafe to eat:

The food safety watchdog also urged people to also check the use-by dates of any St Pierre chocolate croissants in their freezer.

The FSA wrote in its notice: ""The possible presence of mould may make the product unsafe to eat.

""If you have bought any of the above product do not eat it. Instead, return it to your nearest store for a full refund,"" it went on, adding that customers would not need a receipt to do so.""

Food mould is microscopic fungi that reproduce by releasing spores into the air.

When these fall onto food that's starting to turn, they can start to multiply.

Eating food with mould can make you ill, even if you've cut off the offending parts.

The Food Safety and Inspection Service of the US Department of Agriculture also says: ""Some moulds cause allergic reactions and respiratory problems.

""And a few moulds, in the right conditions, produce 'mycotoxins', poisonous substances that can make you sick.""

Experts say those at an increased risk of falling ill from mouldy food include elderly people, children, pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems.

The vice-chair of the Defence Select Committee branded Grant Shapps a ""PR man"". Meanwhile Labour's Keir Starmer is expected to shake up his top team this week

Rishi Sunak promoting Grant Shapps tells Britain's allies the PM ""doesn't give a damn"" about Defence, a former armed forces minister has warned.

The Prime Minister made Mr Shapps Defence Secretary - his fifth ministerial role in a year - on Thursday, after weeks of speculation over who would replace fellow Tory Ben Wallace.

The reshuffle also saw former children's minister Clare Coutinho promoted to Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary.

Meanwhile Labour 's Keir Starmer is expected to shake up his top team tomorrow.

John Spellar, the vice-chair of the Commons Select Committee told this newspaper Mr Shapps was ""basically just a PR man.""

""Grant Shapps has had no background in the brief - unlike several of the contenders who were suggested in the press, who had good knowledge of different parts of defence,"" he said.

""Furthermore, he's flitted from department to department and seems to leave little achievement in his in his wake.""

Mr Spellar, who served as a defence minister under Tony Blair for four years until 2001, added: ""I don't know what our key allies will make of this at a time of heightened international - not only the war in Ukraine, but wider international international tension.

""This is grossly irresponsible, and a sign of a government that's on its way down and on its way out that.""

Ms Coutinho's appointment raised concerns over her mixed voting record on climate issues.

She voted against laws to tackle climate change ten times in just two years.

They included voting against proposals to ""do more in respect of the cost of living and climate change"" and against calls to stamp out most transport emissions by 2030.

And she voted against a blanket ban on burning peat on English moorlands despite a warning from wildlife charities that it would be ""impossible to meet net zero"".

But she did support the government's environment and agriculture bills, and used her maiden speech in Parliament to highlight green issues including wind energy.

A spokesperson for Ms Coutinho said: ""Since 2010, the UK under Conservative leadership has cut carbon emissions faster than any other G7 country.

""Our investment in wind, solar and nuclear means that last year renewables accounted for over 40 per cent of our electricity, compared to just 7 per cent in 2010.

""The new Secretary of State has made clear, including in her maiden speech to Parliament, that delivering cleaner, cheaper energy is a top priority for her.''

Reacting to her appointment, Labour shadow Net Zero secretary Ed Miliband said: ""I congratulate Claire Coutinho on her appointment as Energy Secretary.

""But it speaks volumes about the failures of Conservative energy policy that we are now onto the 6th energy secretary in less than four years. The truth is that the reshuffling of the Tory deckchairs will not get Britain a proper energy policy that delivers lower bills, energy security, good jobs and climate leadership.""

Keir Starmer is expected to hold a shadow reshuffle on Monday - after months of whispers about what the Labour leader's team should look like ahead of the next election.

Deputy leader Angela Rayner, who also holds the positions of Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Shadow Minister for the Future of Work, is widely expected to have some of her jobs reassigned in the shakeup.

But after Rishi Sunak put his full reshuffle on hold until at least the autumn, Labour insiders predicted any changes would likely be on an ""administrative"" level, focusing on frontbenchers while the party focuses on the looming by-elections.

Lily Connors is one of the biggest Doctor Who fans going and her bedroom is overflowing with figurines, props and memorabilia from the hit series that is set to return tomorrow

When it comes to Doctor Who, Lily Connors is obsessed. Her bedroom is filled to the brim with memorabilia from the hit BBC series.

There are cabinets crammed with toys and merchandise, and the house she shares with her parents and two siblings is packed with props. Quite the feat for someone who wasn't even born when the original version of the show finished.

""I started watching Doctor Who when it came back on with Christopher Eccleston,"" says Lily, who holds the Guinness World Record for having the biggest set of Time Lord-related collectibles. ""My parents put it on the TV for me to watch and I would be singing along and dancing to the theme tune.""

The 19-year-old's own collection began with a gift from her father, Tom. Lily says: ""My dad gave me three figures from when he was a kid then I just started to love the show more and more. It kind of went from there. I started collecting the figures. I used to play with them in my room and then when I put them back on my shelf, I put them in scenes. But I'd get the monsters to do funny things like the conga or the YMCA dance.""

In 2017, Guinness World Records counted 6,641 items in Lily's possession but these days, there is far more. ""I'd say it's nearly doubled,"" says agriculture student Lily. ""I have hit double digits - more than 10,000.""

While Lily owns many smaller items, the super fan also has lots of props from the sci-fi production. ""I have two full-size Daleks, a full-size Cyberman, a Cyberman helmet and guns, a clockwork droid, a centaur and a K9,"" she says. ""I'd love a full-size movie Dalek ""¦ that would be the one piece I would love to work towards.""

Lily's favourite possession is her incredible TARDIS wardrobe that was built for her by her father - and looks just like the real thing. ""We actually took the wardrobe down to Newport while they were filming the Peter Capaldi series, and Peter and Pearl Mackie signed it,"" says Lily, who lives in Swansea. ""I also have a board signed by all the cast and crew from the BBC while they were filming the Peter era.""

As for the value of her collection, the teenager can't even hazard a guess. ""I genuinely wouldn't be able to put a price on it. I have no clue how much it would be worth,"" she says.

""We all love watching Doctor Who - we always used to go down to my nan and gramps and we'd put on the TV and have pizza and popcorn and movie nights every week. I had friends in school that were big fans of Doctor Who. I used to run a science-fiction movie club and we always used to watch Doctor Who and just chat about it during lunchtime.""

Lily also travels to conventions all across the country to meet like-minded Whovians, dressing up as characters from her favourite programme. ""Now, I go as a clockwork droid from The Girl in the Fireplace episode,"" she confesses. ""I've got a handmade dress, a wig, a mask and I wear the same gloves and shoes.""

Lily plans to keep collecting as much memorabilia as she can, but admits she is struggling to store it all. ""My mum's starting to run out of space in the house,"" she says. ""I just need a massive house at this point. One room and a kitchen would be like the house and the rest of the place would just be cabinets and shelves and it all displayed everywhere.""

Until she gets her dream house though, Lily will be watching the 60th anniversary specials in her family home. What does she want for Christmas? ""Doctor Who, of course,"" she laughs.

Jey Rence B Quilario has been accused of heading a doomsday cult with over 3,500 members that are holding over 1,500 children and raping and forcing many on them

Over 1,000 children are allegedly being sexually abused on a remote Filipino island at the hands of a doomsday armed cult.

Jey Rence B Quilario was accused this week of heading the religious group where ""rape, sexual violence, child abuse, forced marriage was perpetrated on minors."" Over 1,500 kids are allegedly being held by Socorro Bayanihan Services (SBSI) within a heavily guarded enclave on one of the archipelago's southern islands, close to an internationally renowned surfing spot. Save the Children has urged the Filipino government to take immediate action to free them.

The group reportedly has at least 3,500 members and leader Quilario is referred to as ""The Messiah."" The group reportedly conducted forced marriages of underage girls as young as 13 years old, leeched off its members' social welfare benefits for funds and is believed to have links to drug gangs and extremist groups said to be providing firearms for SBSI's private army.

In a speech on Monday, the chairman of the Senate committee on women and children used congressional privilege to accuse Quilario and his close associates of widespread exploitation. Senator Risa Hontiveros said: ""This is a harrowing story of rape, sexual violence, child abuse, and forced marriage perpetrated on minors by a cult in the municipality of Socorro, Surigao del Norte. We are talking about over a thousand young people in the hands of a deceitful, cruel, and abusive cult""¦ real children are in danger, and time is of the essence. We cannot, we must not look away.""

Fellow senator Ronald Dela Rosa also accused the group's leaders of using cult members as ""human shields"" to avoid prosecution for drug trafficking. He said there were reports the group was running a methamphetamine laboratory from an underground bunker near where Quilario and fellow leaders live.

Ms Hontiveros said a 15-year-old, known as Chloe, was forced into a marriage by Quilario to marry a 21-year-old man when she was just 13. She claimed he locked her in a room with her new husband and told him ""he had the right to rape her."" She added that he stopped minors from attending school and demanded up to 60 per cent of members' pensions and welfare payments.

The accusations of sexual abuse emerged when eight children managed to escape the suspected cult and sought help from the local government office in July. In videos shared by Senator Risa with the Senate and media on Monday, the unnamed girls claimed they were forced by Jay to have sexual intercourse with him before being married off to adult men despite being minors. Leaders of the Socorro Bayanihan Services have denied the allegations, calling them ""fabricated lies.""

Mamerto Galanida, former Socorro town mayor and now vice president of SBSI, said: ""It's unfair because our side was not heard. It's not true that we're a cult because we are avid members of Iglesia Filipina Independiente. Our main purpose is housing because it is difficult to build a house here. Second is agriculture, then third is burial services. When someone dies, we help one another. We are ready for investigations. In fact, we're expecting the Secretary of Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos to come. There's no problem with that.""

A senior meteorologist has shared his predictions for the UK's changing climate over the next 20 to 30 years, warning that we can expect 'chaos' with unpredictable weather and 'surprise' wildfires

Last summer saw 40C temperatures recorded for the first time ever in the UK, with wildfires increasing fourfold in July and an estimated 2,985 deaths associated with the heat.

The Met Office has since released a new report - The State of The UK Climate 2022 - which warned that scorching 40C summers could become the norm in Britain if climate emissions continue as they are - and a weather expert has added to their worrying message.

In recent weeks, we have devastatingly witnessed Greece set ablaze with wildfires ripping through its islands, as temperatures soared to unbearable highs of 46C. And parts of the UK could be set for a similar ""chaotic"" fate in the coming decades, according to Jim N R Dale, a Senior Meteorologist from British Weather Services.

Jim explained how the South East of England and northern Scotland are the areas most likely to be most impacted by the changing climate, telling the Mirror: ""We're seeing a transference of the dry, hot conditions of the Sahara, moving into and across the Mediterranean and affection countries as if they were deserts and then moving into the more northern parts of Europe, including the UK.

""We're not in that right now, it depends on the synoptic situation of the time, but in the longer term, the transference will be into primarily the South East of England and some of that will move into northern Scotland. Particularly for the South East of England, that's the direction of travel after last year's 40.3C.

""That doesn't mean we're going to get that every year, it doesn't mean we'll get heatwaves and droughts and all the rest of it, it will be mixed and changeable but when we do see the transference as we saw in the summer of 2022, then [the heat] will come with a vengeance. When we get exacerbating temperatures in the UK we will see wildfires and forest fires, it will become more common, again not every year, but when they happen they'll come with a vengeance and a surprise.""

He went on to say that he believes we're at a ""tipping point"" with climate change and that we didn't just have to worry about heat, but all extremes of weather over the coming years. ""We are at risk of seeing those extremes in terms of not just heat and wildfire, but also storms, flooding, the intensity of rain, and big southern winds,"" he warned. ""There will be far more energy in the atmosphere and in the oceans, it will be unpredictable.""

The expert continued: ""It's taken us 30 to 40 years to get here, it's going to take another 20 to 40 years to reverse it, and that doesn't mean we give up. It just means we're now in a bit of a perilous state as far as the climate is concerned, as far as the impacts of weather are concerned, and what that actually goes on to mean in terms of our daily lives.

""Weather is in my mind the most impacting feature of our lives. It controls everything, what we eat and drink, what we wear, what we do with our spare time. If you like sports, it has an impact on that and it goes so deep into agriculture, horticulture, and fishing.""

As well as having an impact on our clothes and food, Jim warned the UK could face a number of other consequences if we start experiencing Mediterranean summers here, with temperatures rising to the low 40s up to 45C. This includes an infestation of different types of insects such as mosquitoes, which could see a spread of illnesses such as Dengue Fever and Malaria as a result.

There will also be issues with the buildings in the UK which weren't built for a climate change world, unlike homes abroad which are often made strategically to withstand heat. Similarly, our flora and fauna are not acclimatised to the hot weather and neither are we.

""When temperatures reach the 40-degree mark, your body starts not to cope. That's the truth of it,"" he adds. As such, he advises we all try and educate ourselves and our children on climate change and start making changes to our daily lives to help reduce carbon emissions.

""That doesn't mean you can never fly and it doesn't mean you can never eat meat, but you might be able to start tailing it back by giving up eating beef,"" he explained, sharing how even making gradual changes to your lifestyle could make a difference.

""Tailing it back is where it starts. If you want to do anything about it in the future, this is the point where things need to be turned around. This will be the battle over the next 20 to 30 years and it all starts with the individual and what they do and then it gets passed along to your family and friends, the street, the town and then the country and this will be a subject that will be extremely important at the next general election.""

Colin Armstrong, former honorary consul of the United Kingdom in Guayaquil, was abducted in on Saturday from a farm he owned and now police are questioning his partner

The partner of a millionaire feared Brit kidnapped in Ecuador is being quizzed by police after being rescued, it has been claimed.

Colin Armstrong , former honorary consul of the United Kingdom in Guayaquil, was abducted in the early hours of Saturday from a farm he owned, Ecuadorian police confirmed. A video said to show signs of forced entry, along with traces of blood and ransacked rooms, is understood to be circulating on social media.

Now focus by local authorities has switched to 78-year-old Mr Armstrong's partner Katherine Paola Santos amid claims made on social media about lies over her identity. Lawyer Ricardo Vanegas claimed in a tweet about the Colombian: ""Following the kidnap of Colin Armstrong, it's become known that Katherine Paola Santos was born in the Colombian city of Barranquilla and began having surgery to look more feminine and that her birth name is Alberto Santos. It appears she is now being investigated by prosecutors and police in Ecuador over the kidnap of Colin Armstrong.""

Colombian media says the ongoing investigation to locate Mr Armstrong is being handled personally by Ecuador National Police director Cesar Augusto Zapata along with a specialist anti-kidnap and extortion unit called UNASE. British intelligence services are also said to be assisting the Ecuadorian-led investigation into the whereabouts of the missing expat.

As well as founding and owning a large agricultural supply company in the South American country, he is a director along with his son of the 500-acre Tupgill Park Estate near Leyburn in North Yorkshire, which has been the family home for more than 45 years.

Ecuador's National Police have so far made only one official comment on the kidnap, which happened at around 2.45am local time on Saturday at the British businessman's ranch called Rancho Rodeo Grande near the town of Baba in Los Rios province, two hours drive north of Guayaquil.

In a tweet sent on Saturday, the force said: ""Following an apparent criminal act against a businessman in the early hours of this morning in Los Rios, specialist police units are carrying out operative and investigative work on the ground.""

Mr Colin, as he was known affectionately by staff at the ranch, is understood to have been kidnapped in an operation involving more than 15 gangsters and forcibly bundled into a black BMW he owned with his partner which was later found abandoned near the scene.
Last night it was reported Nick Armstrong, Mr Armstrong's son who helps run the family estate in North Yorkshire, had flown to Ecuador to help police locate his father.

His daughter, Diana Armstrong-Bruns, an estate agent based in California, told MailOnline: ""This is a critical time, we've been told not to say anything to anyone. We just want my father back."" Mr Armstrong, who is thought to have previously been married to an Ecuadorian woman, has had a long association with the South America country. He founded Agripac in 1972.

Colin's adopted son, Leo Morris, helps run a restaurant at the family's Yorkshire estate. The estate now welcomes more than 150,000 visitors a year to an attraction known as the Forgotten Corner which was originally built as a private folly. Footage showing the aftermath of the kidnap was posted online shortly after it happened.

A woman thought to be a member of staff filming inside the ranch took close-up shots of broken plates on the floor and a man who appeared to be holding a bandage to his head. She then walked into one of the bedrooms where there was blood over the bed and said as she focused in on the stained sheets: ""This is where they hit him. My God what is this!!!""

Lolita, once deemed the 'world's loneliest' orca whale had been performing at the Miami Seaquarium for over 50 years. She died Friday, August 18, just as she was about to be released

An orca whale held captive for more than a half-century has died.

Lolita, once deemed the ""world's loneliest whale,"" died Friday at the Miami Seaquarium as caregivers prepared to move her from the theme park in the near future. The Seaquarium posted a statement from the nonprofit group Friends of Toki on social media that Lolita ""” also known as Tokitae, or Toki ""” started exhibiting serious signs of discomfort over the past two days.

Seaquarium and Friends of Toki medical team members began treating her immediately and aggressively, but the 57-year-old orca died from an apparent renal condition, the statement said. ""Toki was an inspiration to all who had the fortune to hear her story and especially to the Lummi nation that considered her family,"" the Friends of Toki statement said. ""Those who have had the privilege to spend time with her will forever remember her beautiful spirit.""

For all the latest news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US

Animal rights activists have been fighting for years to have Lolita freed from her tank at the Miami Seaquarium. The park's relatively new owner, The Dolphin Company, and the nonprofit Friends of Toki announced a plan in March to possibly move her to a natural sea pen in the Pacific Northwest, with the financial backing of Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay.

""I am heartbroken that Toki has left us,"" Irsay said in a statement. ""Her story captured my heart, just as it did millions of others. I was honored to be part of the team working to return her to her indigenous home, and I take solace in knowing that we significantly improved her living conditions this past year. Her spirit and grace have touched so many. Rest in peace, dear Toki.""

The Lummi Nation, a Native American tribe based in Washington state, refers to orcas as ""qwe 'lhol mechen,"" which means ""our relations below the waves."" The tribe has spent years working to secure Lolita's release and to return to her home waters.

""The Lummi Nation is saddened by the news that our beloved Orca relative has passed away at the estimated age of 57 years old,"" Chairman Tony Hillaire said in a statement. ""Our hearts are with all those impacted by this news; our hearts are with her family. We stand in solidarity with our Lummi members who poured their hearts and souls into bringing Sk'aliCh'elh-tenaut home.""

Lolita retired from performing last spring as a condition of the park's new exhibitor's license with the US Department of Agriculture. She's not been publicly displayed since. In recent months, new upgrades had been installed to better filter the pool and regulate her water temperature.

Federal and state regulators would have had to approve any plan to move Lolita, and that could have taken months or years. The 5,000-pound (2,267-kilogram) had been living for years in a tank that measures 80 feet by 35 feet (24 meters by 11 meters) and is 20 feet (6 meters) deep.

The tiny shepherd's hut and stone barn sit close to the village of East Prawle in South Devon, with the plot's £475,000 price tag twice that of the UK's average property value

A tiny shepherd's hut and barn have gone on sale for almost half a million pounds.

The green four-wheeled shed and stone building overlook magnificent views of the South Devon seascape, sitting close to Britain's most expensive seaside town.

The £475,000 asking price is twice the UK average for a house and there's no guarantee it can all be used as a residential property.

The listing says the barn, in South Hams, has potential for change of use, but that is subject to planning permission.

Buyers would also get 1.07 acres of land.

The plot, called Shell Barn, is situated about one mile from the village of East Prawle.

It's close to Salcombe where homes sell for an average of £1.2million.

The current UK average is £287,880.

The listing says the barn measures 4.60 metres wide and 8 metres long, or 791 square feet.

It adds: ""Attached to the east elevation of the barn is a single storey modern farm building extension which measures (externally) as 4.60 m wide x 4.80 metres long, so 22.00 square metres (237 square feet).

""The total therefore of the two buildings combined of 95.60 square metres (1,028 square feet).

""Constructed of stone built walls under a slate roof, the stone barn is mainly open plan on both floors but with a small store to one side on the ground floor with a WC installed.

""The barn stands in its own area of agricultural land which is all down to grass and bordered by a council maintained highway on the west boundary and surrounded by agricultural land on the other boundaries.""

Former Tory PM David Cameron bought a shepherd's hut in 2017 in the aftermath of Brexit and his resignation from Downing Street.

He planned to use it to write his memoirs and paid just £25,000 for it.

The politician later purchased a second hut for his holiday home in Cornwall.

Residents of Salcombe have been left frustrated that prices have risen by 123 percent in the last 10 years - and 33 percent per annum.

Julian Brazil, the Liberal Democrat opposition leader, told the Daily Mail: ""The problem is that the key workers""¦not just the teachers and the nurses and the care workers, but also the cleaners and the dustman and the postmen and basically everyone that keeps it going, just cannot afford to live down here.""

Beth Hillier, owner of beach shop Aloft, said she thinks the towns exclusivity is what appeals to the wealthy buyers.

She said: ""It's this little unknown spot that people have discovered over the years [with] a very tasteful, relaxed pace of life.

""I do think people like the feeling that they're somewhere expensive, and it's just got that sort of very relaxed vibe where people stopped life and got off the treadmill for a week.""

South Hams last year voted in favour of a policy where council tax on second homes would be charged at double the normal rate.

However, a loophole reportedly allowed many owners to switch to business rates and avoid any tax.

WARNING, DISTRESSING CONTENT: Video has emerged that appears to show a Palestinian man being shot by a gunman - understood to be an Israeli settler - who is then manhandled away by alleged Israeli Defence Force soldiers

This is the shocking moment a Palestinian civilian is shot by a man said to be an Israeli settler as tensions flare amid the continuing Israel-Hamas war.

Zakarya Adra was unarmed when trying to fend off the person approaching a crowd of Palestinian civilians with an assault rifle, before he was shot in the stomach from point-blank range. Video shows the armed man, wearing a red t-shirt, walking towards a group of Palestinians. Mr Adra holds his ground and then a very short scuffle ensues between him and the gunman. The red t-shirted man then steps back and shoots Mr Adra in the stomach.

""ŒThe wounded man drops to the ground before his family and friends rush to his aid. The gunman is subsequently ushered away from the scene by a man in military uniform, thought to be a member of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). Mr Adra, 28, has been fighting for his life after being wounded in the incident which took place on Friday near the southern West Bank village of At-Tuwani. The shooting has been blamed on residents of the Havat Ma'on settlement.

""ŒThe wounded man's cousin, Mohammad Hureini, described his condition following Friday's attack as ""not good"" adding: ""He is still in the hospital, we are waiting for news about him there. We don't know what to do, just pray for him.""""Œ Mr Hureini's uncle, Hafez Hureini, is the founder of Youth of Sumud, a non-violent, youth-oriented Palestinian civil rights group.The Hureinis and Mr Adra come from a family committed to peaceful acts of resistance against the Israeli occupation.

""ŒA photo of apparently bloodstained, twisted metal said to have been taken from Mr Adra's body has since been produced, with the accusation it is evidence of the use of illegal explosive bullets. This particular type of ammunition - designed to cause maximum internal body damage - has been cited by organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross as illegal under customary International Humanitarian Law since the 1868 St Petersburg Declaration. Use of explosive bullets was explicitly reaffirmed as a 'war crime' following the First World War.

""ŒIn recent years there have regularly been claims - denied by the Israeli authorities - that the ammunition has been both supplied and used in the Middle East conflict. The Mirror contacted an Israeli Defense Force (IDF) spokesperson for comment on Friday's incident and the claims regarding explosive ammunition.

""ŒViolence in the West Bank has spiralled after the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, following the Hamas attacks in Southern Israel and Israel's bombings and ongoing demolition of the Gaza Strip, with the region descended into a humanitarian crisis. Less than 60 miles from Gaza, the West Bank is another area of ongoing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.

Situated in the Masafer Yatta region, At-Tuwani had already become a regular target for settler attacks in the past 18 months, after the Israeli Supreme Court permitted the forced eviction of Palestinians from Masafer Yatta and destruction of their homes to make way for 'Firing Zone 918'. The UN has labelled these evictions as a ""war crime"" and a ""gross violation"" of human rights.

They also restore caves in once-evicted areas of Masafer Yatta to encourage displaced Palestinians to return to live on their former land.

Forget five a day - nutritional therapist Ian Marber, aka The Food Doctor, explains why variety is the spice of life when it comes to eating a healthy diet

The chances are you'll be very familiar with the five-a-day message. And even if you don't quite know the logic behind the magic number, the gist of the advice is clear: make sure you eat at least five portions of fruit and veg every day.

The slogan first appeared over 30 years ago, back in 1991. It was the result of a collaboration between the US National Cancer Institute and a commercially funded group of farmers in California.

It has gone on to become one of the best-known pieces of healthy eating advice.

There are plenty of reasons why we should be ensuring we get enough fruit and veg, not least because they contain a huge array of nutrients, ranging from the more familiar vitamins and minerals to bioflavonoids, carotenoids, glucosinolates, phytoestrogens and organosulfides.

These plant chemicals perform many roles, with potent antioxidant properties helping to reduce inflammation, promote natural detoxification, reduce blood pressure, help good bacteria in the gut to thrive and enhancing strong bones.

Collectively, the nutrients in fruit and vegetables can also help lower the risk of heart disease, stroke and some cancers, while promoting gut health.

But how many potions we eat each day is only half the story.

Variety in what you consume is just as important for ensuring you get a complete range of the vitamins and nutrients our bodies need.

Broccoli is brilliant, but if you only eat that you'd be missing out on the antioxidants that come with blueberries and the anti-cancer pigment lycopene which is abundant in cooked tomatoes, for example.

That's why nutritionists are now prioritising a new target: 30 a week. That's 30 different types of fruits and vegetables every seven days, while consuming those five (or more!) servings every day.

It sounds like a daunting target, but it doesn't have to be. We all have our go-to recipes that we come back to time and again, and it's the same with the foods we buy.

They are familiar, we know how to prepare them and we can buy them confident that they won't go to waste.

But with some smart tweaks here and there, boosting the variety in your diet is easier than you might think - and it's well worth the effort.

In fact, there are plenty of simple ways to hit the big 3-0.

Write it down

A quick look online will show quite how many fruits and vegetables there are.

One easy way to start expanding your repertoire is to search for ""fruits that begin with the letter C"" (cantaloupe, cherries, clementine etc) or ""vegetables that start with L"" (lettuce, leeks, lentils etc).

While you won't find many starting with z, x or q (quince, anyone?) there's a whole alphabet to explore.

Try something new every week

Some fruits and vegetables will be very familiar, while others may be new to you.

If you aim to try something new every week then you are bound to find new favourites that you can add to your go-to recipes, or try out new recipes altogether.

You never know what you may discover, there's lots of delicious fruit and vegetable varieties out there.

Smart cooking

If you are using the oven to cook then it makes sense to make the most of the energy outlay.

If you have some vegetables you haven't used, try roasting them in a little olive oil and seasoning to enjoy cold tomorrow rather than let them go to waste.

If you usually boil your vegetables, switch it up by steaming, sautÃ©ing or grilling, and enjoy other varieties with some different textures on top, such as nuts.

Cans are your friend

Canned vegetables are often good value and are a store cupboard staple, especially if they come in unsalted water.

Beans are rich in fibre and a source of protein, and are especially versatile. Roast chickpeas and have them with pasta or spooned onto soup.

Or warm up well-rinsed black beans or lentils, perhaps with oregano, chilli flakes or cumin seeds, and enjoy with your main meal, or as a dip.

Freeze for later

Frozen fruits or vegetables are a very economical way to be able to use only what you need, avoiding any wastage.

Try frozen berries in a smoothie or use some to make a compote to add to cereal or porridge.

There are many choices when it comes to frozen vegetables, including peas or broccoli.

They're easy to find and can be stirred into rice at the end of cooking.

Don't compromise when time poor

We don't always have time to prepare every meal from scratch and often for our lunch break we make or buy something convenient.

However, convenient food can still be nutritious. These days you can find plant based meals on supermarket shelves that offer two of your five-a-day and more of the 30-a-week.

Plus they have the added benefit that they can be heated and enjoyed in minutes.

Take healthy fast food brand BOL Foods, for example. Each pot of its garden pea and spinach soup includes three of your five-a-day and 19g of fibre. The firm's One Pot Meals contain beans that are packed with fibre to keep you fuller for longer and help you reach your 30-a-week goal with minimal effort.

Switch it up

Whether it's preparing an easy weeknight meal for the family, sorting out packed lunches or making something special for a weekend gathering, we all have recipes that we know and can rely on.

But switching things up doesn't have to mean relearning a familiar recipe - you can just make some easy tweaks.

You could swap regular potatoes for sweet potato or yams. Or blend some butter beans into a soup, or chop up some leftover green vegetables to add to pasta or a lunchtime salad.

Eat with the seasons

Now more than ever it makes sense to try locally grown British produce, and eating what's in season is a great way to try new foods.

Late spring brings us strawberries, watercress and asparagus while the summer crops include courgettes, cucumber and runner beans.

Make it fun for little ones

We all know it can be hard to get kids to eat new foods, but making a game out of it can make things a bit of an adventure.

You might get them to write the names of different fruits and vegetables on small pieces of paper or card, put them in a jar, then ask them to pick some each week to try with you.

Or you could ask your children to pick fruit and vegetables that begin with all the letters in their first name and set that as a goal for the week.

Look for colour

Trying new foods can be as simple as eating different varieties of some familiar everyday foods. That could mean orange tomatoes, yellow courgettes or purple radishes, as the varying hues all variously contribute to the 30-a-week.

How much is a portion?

Bear in mind that we should aim for at least 400g of fruit and veg every day, so each portion is 80g.

â– When it comes to fruit, a small portion is about two small plums or satsumas, seven strawberries or 14 cherries, a medium apple, banana or pear.

â– For vegetables, a raw tomato, three celery sticks or 5cm of cucumber will do, but when cooked you'll need two spears of broccoli, four heaped tablespoons of spinach or beans, but only three of cooked carrots or peas.

â– A smoothie counts as one portion, as does a 150ml glass of unsweetened juice - but stick to just one of these per day.

â– Ian Marber, known as The Food Doctor, is an independent nutritional therapist and resident nutritionist at BOL Foods (bolfoods.com)

Holly Willoughby will make an appearance on Midsomer Murders when the series returns this weekend, with a brief preview clip teased on Good Morning Britain earlier today

Holly Willoughby's cameo on Midsomer Murders has finally been teased with the star seemingly playing a version of herself on the ITV drama.

The This Morning presenter's acting stint was discussed on Good Morning Britain earlier today, with hosts Kate Garraway and Richard Madeley playing a clip from the drama ahead of its return to our screens this Sunday. The episode was actually filmed two years ago, with the mum-of-three speaking about her cameo in 2021.

""I thought it was just interesting people would turn to a series about murder and death for escapism. People have found it a joyous escape from the horrors of real life,"" Holly said around the time of filming. ""My episode involves a murder mystery country house party weekend. Barnaby and Winter turn up to investigate. Everyone is trapped on this island with a murderer.""

Holly's acting debut is almost finally ready to be seen, two years on from filming. In a preview clip of Midsomer Murders shown on Good Morning Britain today, Holly can be seen sitting on a throne like seat while seeming being interviewed. ""Is that the queen of daytime,"" one detective asks as he spots Holly's character, with his older colleague replying: ""Gloria Hunniford? Are you sure?""

""That's Holly!"" Richard declared once the clip ended, with Kate adding: ""What's she doing cropping up in Midsomer?"" Neil Dudgeon, who plays DCI John Barnaby in the ITV drama series, teased viewers and told the two presenters: ""Well, she's sort of a friend of the show I suppose - she's a great fan of the show and we're always looking to broaden our casting net.""

Discussing Holly further, Neil added: ""She was great, she was thoroughly professional. I think she was a bit nervous when she first arrived. She's playing a character called Holly Willoughby, I wouldn't like to say that it's herself."" It was later revealed Holly's scenes were filmed two years ago and a further two series of Midsomer Murders have been filmed since.

Holly described her filming stint on Midsomer Murders as one of the best days of her life back in 2021, with the star's friends and family rushing to praise her. ""Everybody I know who has watched all of Midsomer says it's one of their favourites we've ever made,' Holly said at the time. ""I said to them 'Thanks for having me, it was one of the best days of my life'.""

Discussing filming her cameo on This Morning in 2021, Holly told her then co-host Phillip Schofield it took her almost 25 takes before she was able to deliver her scripted words out properly. ""It wasn't 'take one', put it that way... Or 'take two' or 'take 10',"" she shared on the ITV show. ""Around about take 25 I got the words out but it's fine.""

Holly had been left speechless in March 2021 as she was surprised live on This Morning with the news she had landed a guest role on the detective drama. Midsomer Murders stars Neil Dudgeon and Nick Hendrix were the ones to ask the presenter to guest star in an upcoming episode.

""Yes! Of course, I say yes. I have seen every single episode since it started way back when. Are you serious?"" Holly exclaimed, immediately accepting the offer. She went on to joke about her acting abilities, quipping: ""I mean you are going to have to kill me off really quickly because I am terrible at acting. I don't know what I am going to do.""

The mum has been met with huge support online after admitting that she finds it difficult to see wealthier families going on more lavish trips than she can afford

A struggling mum has opened up about her resentment towards wealthier parents who take their children on lavish trips away, as she's jealous that she can't afford to take her own kids.

She knows that little ones always cherish any time away spent with their family, regardless of the location, but can't shake off the feelings of frustration.

During the holidays she often catches glimpses of other families' holidays through social media and says it's difficult seeing the pictures.

She added that she feels ""ashamed"" when she can only afford to take her kids to Wales rather than the fancy holidays that others take abroad.

After sharing her struggles on Mumsnet, other parents have flooded the comments in support of the mum and said she's still making amazing memories for her kids.

In the post, the woman, who remained anonymous, explained: ""I dread school holidays. Mostly because everyone we know has way more money than us resulting in an endless stream of Instagram or Facebook posts of skiing, Dubai, Thailand, whatever.

""I know I should feel happy for them, but I just feel like a failure that I can't give my kids these experiences. I do my best to avoid social media, but inevitably this topic crops up in conversation and I find myself feeling small and ashamed that we just go to Wales for a long weekend.""

She added that she understands people have bigger problems but admits she's worn out from her feelings of jealousy.

In response, many flooded the comments supporting the mum and said she shouldn't feel jealous at all as she's still creating memories her kids will cherish.

One person wrote: ""Do not feel jealous at all. I bet your kids just have the best time going to Wales and they don't even have the tiniest thought of doing anything else.""

Another stated: ""Enjoy what you guys do and amazing memories don't have to cost lots of money.""

A third recalled: ""Some of my happiest childhood memories are staying in a leaky cabin in Wales with my mum and dad and siblings, even though all my friends were jetting off to Australia and America and whatever.""

Tesco brought in buying restrictions in February in response to supply issues within the industry and put in place a three-item buying limit per customer

Tesco has become the latest retailer to lift buying restrictions across certain fruits and vegetables.

The big four supermarket confirmed on Tuesday that it had removed its buying limit on tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers.

The move followed Asda, Lidl and Aldi who removed all their buying restrictions over the past week.

Tesco brought in buying restrictions in February in response to supply issues within the industry and put in place a three-item buying limit per customer.

Aldi and Lidl also capped the number of peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes to three units per customer while Asda initially had a limit on eight pieces of fruit and veg.

The three item limit was across tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, salad bags, broccoli, cauliflower and raspberries.

As of writing, Morrisons is the only supermarket to continue to have restrictions in place for customers.

It recently removed its limits on cucumbers, but limits remain in place on tomatoes, lettuce and peppers to two packs per customer.

Other supermarket chains such as Sainsbury's, Waitrose, Marks & Spencer, Iceland and Co-Op did not introduce restrictions in their stores.

Shoppers began sharing their frustration about shortages of tomatoes around February 20 this year. .

The shortages soon spread to other products, leaving shelves bare of a number of fresh produce items.

The reason for the shortages was due to the UK's major winter suppliers Morocco and Spain experiencing cold temperatures, heavy rain, and flooding for a few weeks at the beginning of the year.

Morrocan growers and suppliers also saw ferries cancelled due to the bad weather.

The British Retail Consortium said Britain typically imports 95% of its tomatoes and 90% of lettuces from December to March.

Another reason for the reduced supplies has also been down to rising energy costs for British growers.

British farmers are struggling to power their greenhouses which are used to grow specific crops during the colder months.

The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said shortages of some fruit and vegetables in UK supermarkets could be ""the tip of the iceberg"".

Other food experts have warned that for shortages could become the norm in the UK due to the climate crisis as the world looks set to see more extreme floods, frosts, droughts and heatwaves.

Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool contract runs until the summer of 2026 and Michael Owen has now offered his view on who could potentially take over after the German's eventual Anfield exit

Michael Owen believes that Xabi Alonso could be an ideal successor to Jurgen Klopp with the German having a big role to play in a potential move.

Klopp has proven a pivotal figure during a transformative spell at Anfield. He ended the club's long wait for a Premier League title, while also winning the Champions League, FA Cup and more.

The former Borussia Dortmund coach's contract is set to run until the summer of 2026 - Klopp signing a new deal last year. However, it appears that thought is already being paid to his potential replacement.

Ex-midfielder Alonso has been touted as a potential successor following his excellent work with Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen. Former Liverpool striker Owen believes the midfielder would be an excellent candidate but circumstances outside of his control could dictate whether he returns to Merseyside or not.

Speaking with DAZN Bet, Owen said: ""Well, everyone was saying Steven Gerrard was Jurgen Klopp's successor when he was at Rangers, so as we all know timing is everything in life. Klopp has done, and is continuing to do, the most incredible job at Liverpool over the years.

""Things don't last forever and it all depends on what Klopp does. If Klopp decided to go in the summer, it would be about who was available then. If he decides to go in five years time then it's a totally different picture, so it's all about timing in life, it's all about as and when Klopp decides he's had enough.

Who do you think could replace Jurgen Klopp? Share your suggestions in the comments below

""Œ""It will be about who is doing well at the time. Of course [Xabi] Alonso has links with the club, the fans love him, so he would be someone the club would consider if he was still doing well. But there could be other people cropping up in the meantime, anything could happen.

""But it all depends on what Klopp decides to go, and looking at the team he's got right now I don't think that will be any time soon.""

Alonso has certainly been impressing during his time with Leverkusen. His side currently lead the Bundesliga standings ahead of reigning champions Bayern Munich.

They have won seven out of their opening eight league matches - their latest success coming in the form of a 2-1 victory against Wolfsburg. Leverkusen also sit top of their Europa League group with a perfect record of three wins from as many games.

Alonso was appointed as the club's new manager back in October 2022 and also sees his deal expire in 2026 after signing a two-year extension earlier this year.

The Mirror takes a look at the sinister world of dodgy dog breeding as bully-type puppies are being poorly bred and kept in a semi-comatose state trapped in darkness, trained on treadmills and forced to fight for social media

Extreme dog breeding is big business and profit-driven breeders are continuing to put their wealth over animal welfare in order to cash in - with dodgy dealers earning up to £250k salaries. Devastatingly, this often means mating and selling untrained crossbreeds that have the power to kill after putting them through their paces with treadmill training and leaving them alone in dark rooms.

When not looked after properly, these poorly bred yet powerful dogs can attack other pets and people, as we've increasingly seen in recent times. Of the 10 fatal dog attacks in the UK last year, more than half of them involved the controversial American XL bully.

It seems a cult has formed around bull breeds online, with an increasingly close relationship highlighted between organised crime and dog dealing. Careless and uneducated dealers are breeding dangerous dogs, and little is being done about it.

With American XL bullies making headlines after another viciously attacked an 11-year-old girl last weekend, and Home Secretary Suella Braverman pushing for an urgent ban on what looks like an uncontrollable breed, the Mirror takes a look into the depraved and dark world of dangerous backyard breeders - from training puppies on treadmills to forcing them to fight against each other.

Criminal gangs cashing in

Last year, a Mirror investigation found that new dog dealers were being encouraged to make ""monsters"" out of powerful dogs to earn up to £250,000. The RSPCA said it had seen animals kept in ""medieval"" conditions, with ""breeding bitches kept in darkness or living in their own faeces"" by money-grabbing breeders, making hundreds and thousands of pounds.

The dog breeding craze, which erupted during the pandemic, has caused the ""perfect storm for dog bites"". It prompted the arrival of pet 'fertility clinics', offering training on how to become a DIY breeder at home; and dog semen was found being posted with artificial insemination (AI) kits sent by post. Illegal ear cropping was also discovered being offered by crooks online, specifically to give XL bullies the American 'look'.

A gang from Stoke-on-Trent was jailed in 2022 after puppies were found in a semi-comatose state after cropping their ears. RSPCA chief vet Caroline Allen said at the time: ""Ear cropping has absolutely no positive effect on the dog themself and is done purely for cosmetic reasons because someone wants a specific 'tough' look for their dog. Sadly, it's a trend that, despite being illegal, seems to be growing in popularity.""

Ian Briggs, from the RSPCA's special operations unit, previously spoke out about the so-called cottage breeders ""churning out puppy after puppy after puppy and charging thousands with it with no real knowledge"". He explained: ""There are criminal gangs involved - certainly around the Bully XL market - that have obviously seen a way of coining in a huge amount of cash. They are operating outside the licensing rules.

""If you are looking at between £2,000 to £5,000 for a puppy and you get four puppies out of a dog, it's a lot of money. They are making hundreds of thousands of pounds. It's not just the XL Bullies though, there are the high value Frenchies too. It's all about turning over vast profits. But with the Bully XL if they bite you it is likely you will be seriously injured.""

Mr Briggs explained that the new market for puppy bull breeds has attracted a new wave of sellers that lack knowledge and care. ""What it's done is attract certain people to the breeding market that weren't there before because they can see so much money to be made. You can just see it coming. It's almost coming in slow motion, a tsunami of welfare issues,"" he said. He explained that these dodgy dealers are ""exploiting animals and the buyer for financial gain"".

Social media money craze

In recent years, the American XL bully business has been garnering popularity on social media platforms, with breeders swapping tips about how to 'market' your pack to make the maximum amount of money from puppies. In one YouTube video, viewers are told the UK is ""smashing"" the XL bully market and you can get puppies younger than eight weeks - which is against the advice of Lucy's Law in the UK.

A dealer online says: ""We've been in the bully game for over a year now and have got a bit of knowledge that we can guide you and help you on your way to raise monsters and make ker-ching."" His sidekick adds: ""Step One is picking your right stud, knowing what you are buying... do your research."" The dog dealers say that marketing is ""super important"" and ""it's all about status"" - rather than the welfare of the animal.

Sickening fighting pits

Dog fighting was banned along with all other animal fighting in 1835, and yet illegal dog fights have soared by almost a half since Covid, fuelled by a sickening stream of online videos. The RSPCA was called to 330 fights last year compared to 226 in 2019. And this year, numbers are on track to be even higher with 149 savage encounters recorded up to May.

The RSPCA runs stings to take down the violent and disturbing groups at the top level of this disgusting spectacle. The fights - some reported to be worth up to £50,000 - pit dog against dog until one dies or can no longer fight. They are said to attract heavy betting and guns and drugs are often found at the secret venues. Ian Muttitt, a chief inspector with the RSPCA, said earlier this year that technology now allows these fights to be organised easily and discreetly.

The charity believe backyard breeding and an explosion in demand for bully-type dogs is feeding lower-level fighting, such as chain contests in parks. And they say this is directly linked to the growing number of aggressive ""status"" dogs on the streets. Mr Muttitt said youngsters often start with an interest in ""status"" dogs and progress to the top levels of fighting. Coupled with the rising number of violent videos it was causing a ""perfect storm"".

He was also concerned about algorithms fuelling interest in fighting after it had been viewed once online. He advised: ""If you see a fight in a park or a public place contact the police and the RSPCA but do not get directly involved. Other tell-tale signs would be a lot of dogs coming and going from a property. If people are keeping dogs locked up and away from public view, or if people hear reports of dog fighting going on in their area, they can report things anonymously to Crimestoppers or to the RSPCA.""

Dog treadmills for training

Before pitting them against each other, dodgy dog breeders are tethering terriers to makeshift treadmills and forcing them to run for their life - training to either kill or be killed in the brutal fighting bloodsport. This hideous set-up was discovered in a raid this week, when the Mirror joined the RSPCA and police on the covert operation to take down a suspected dog fighting ring.

West Midlands Police said two men, aged 30 and 32, were arrested under section 8 of the Animal Welfare Act and five dogs were seized from a property in Saltley, Birmingham on Tuesday. Dogs, drugs and a machete were pulled from the house on a quiet residential road, and a huge medieval-type contraption was also wheeled onto the street.

As daylight broke, it became clear it was a dog treadmill. Such treadmills are commonly used to train fighting dogs, building both strength and stamina. A spokesperson for West Midlands Police said: ""Along with the dogs, officers found dog training equipment and books about dog breeding as well as a machete and a quantity of suspected Class A drugs.""

'Vicious' behavioural problems

American bullies and their variants can fetch as much as £6,000 on online marketplaces, and thousands of them are currently being listed across the UK for anybody to buy without checks. There are currently 1,303 American bully dogs and puppies for sale on Freeads, while on Pets4Homes, there are 866 puppies being sold. Meanwhile, on gumtree there are 163 XL Bullys available.

Several people currently selling bully-type dogs online allude to the animals having behavioural problems. And while some sellers don't stipulate the breed, many use the term 'not good with kids' on the listing as a codeword for a bully. One owner selling her American bully 'urgently' for £300 on Freeads described her pup, which is just 10-months-old, as being already a ""big heavy boy"". She added: ""Unfortunately my boy wasn't the right choice for my family. A big hyper dog and three young children. This isn't what I want to do but it just isn't fair on him or the kids right now.""

Another, who had originally paid £6,000 for their pocket bully - a smaller version of the American bully, said she had listed the dog on Freeads for £1000 to £1,500 after it had a fight with her other dog. One dog listing in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, for a male 15-month-old American XL bully going for £850 said it was not neutered as the vet was unable to get him upstairs to sedate him. The owner added: ""Looking for an only-dog home as can be vicious towards other dogs, hence the reason for rehoming. My older boys are 10 and he's attacked both of them mainly over food. You will need to be able to handle him as he is strong.""

Animal behaviourist Zoe Willingham told the Mirror: ""We need to look at the reasons why these dogs have attacked. Unscrupulous breeders are breeding them to be guard dogs and having these aggressive tendencies. But then they are falling into family homes as pets, which is how you end up with this situation of people trying to sell them on because they can't control them and don't know what they are taking on and not seeking advice about how to look after these dogs or keep themselves safe.""

Joseph Rindsland, head of trust and safety at Gumtree, said: ""At Gumtree, nothing is more important to us than the safety of our users and the welfare of the animals listed on our site. We pride ourselves on being a responsible platform and as a member of the Pets Advertising Advisory Group (PAAG) - the UK's trade body covering online animal sales made up of 25 welfare organisations including the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Dogs Trust, and the RSPCA among others - we will always follow Government advice and legislation. Should the Home Office move forward with a ban, our dedicated safety team would make sure that it was reflected in our posting policies. In the meantime, we would ask that all our users seriously consider the characteristics of a dog, and their needs, before agreeing to rehome a pet. We have comprehensive educational material about different breeds on our site which we would strongly recommend users read carefully.""

A spokesperson for Pets4Homes said: ""Pets4Homes takes our commitment to the safe rehoming of pets seriously. We work with responsible and vetted breeders, provide detailed breed guidelines to those considering rehoming a dog, and work closely with authorities to ensure that we adhere to all UK laws. We do not feature breeds that Defra or PAAG (the Pet Advertising Advisory Group) have a recommendation against rehoming. Should the law or recommendations change on this specific breed, we will update our policies.""

Dangerous dog capital

Figures released last year by NHS England revealed that you are almost 10 times more likely to be bitten by a dog in Knowsley, Merseyside, than the rest of Britain. Doctors in the area see more than 24 people each year with dog bites, 60 percent higher than the national average of 15. Coined the country's 'dangerous dog capital', owners are claimed to parade their XL bullies around the park and use public spaces as illegal breeding grounds at night.

Locals speak of being too frightened to walk down the street, and of being wary of taking young children out for the day. In Knowsley, one resident, who wished to remain anonymous, described the number of dangerous dogs roaming her community, including Stadt Moers Park, as ""appalling"". She said: ""There's been at least four dog-on-dog attacks recently in this park. Only the other day a dog had its throat ripped out and was left with 500 stitches. It's a miracle it survived.

""This is my fear all the time. What scares me is that it could be a child next. It's macho-ism, it's young men who own these dogs. You have all these bullies going around, all these pitbull crosses, and they rule the roost, they do what they want to do."" The resident added: ""They have even been here breeding the dogs of a night.""

Resident Kathy Brogan, 71, said the situation made her reconsider where she can take her three-year-old grandson, Finn, and pet dog. She said: ""It makes us wary of where we walk. You do hear about dogs attacking kids and dogs attacking other dogs in Knowsley. There was a child attacked just the other day. We get a lot of people with powerful dogs, some of them off the lead, and it's frightening."" Less than five miles away, in St Helens, attacks average 19 per year. Two children have lost their lives.

One St Helens woman told of being attacked by a Rottweiler last year. The 47-year-old, who did not want to be named, said: ""The girl had to punch her own dog in the head several times to get it off me. It was trying to rip my arm off. I thought I was going to bleed out."" The woman, who had to have surgery, said she was haunted by physical and mental scars. She said: ""The number of powerful breeds in the area is scary. The scales are heavily tipped towards the larger breeds and I think it's incredibly irresponsible. I have no issue with specific breeds but know how to handle it if you are going to get one, don't put us all at risk.""

Danger Dogs - our demands

The Mirror is calling for these changes:

1. The overhaul of the Dangerous Dogs Act . An urgent review of the law is needed and tougher penalties should be considered.

2. Enforce the rules to stop the illegal and irresponsible breeding and selling of dogs.

3. A public information campaign to promote the importance of responsible dog ownership and the need for training.

The Mirror is demanding more robust sanctions as part of its Time for Action on Dangerous Dogs campaign. We want a new Jack Lis Law to end the maulings - named in honour of the boy killed in November 2021. The Mirror is calling for an urgent review of the law on dangerous dogs and tougher penalties, as well as proper enforcement of rules to stop the illegal and irresponsible breeding and selling of dogs. We also want the Government to launch a public information campaign to promote responsible dog ownership and the need for training.

As Matt Baker's new Channel 4 series airs this Saturday, the former Blue Peter star spoke to the Mirror about his American travels, how it compares to farm life in Durham Dales, and why the I'm A Celeb jungle isn't that different to home

Matt Baker has been one of the most recognisable British faces on television for decades now - from presenting Blue Peter to starring in Doctor Who and feeling at home on Countryfile.

His passion for animals, farming and living in the countryside has seen him travel the world in search of rural communities and open his farm gates to camera crews in Durham Dales.

""I filed three passports when I was at Blue Peter. I've had a lot of amazing experiences throughout my career and there's not many things I haven't done really,"" Matt told the Mirror, ahead of his new Channel 4 show - Matt Baker's Travels in the Country: USA.

But the BBC presenter is yet to head into the Australian jungle, despite being rumoured in the line-up numerous times, and he revealed very little about the possibility of swapping sheep for snakes this year.

""We've got woods on our farm and I spend a lot of time out there - it's kind of the Durham Dales version of the jungle. I'm not shy of being out in the trees,"" Matt said on the topic of I'm A Celebrity: Get Me Out Of Here. So far, Boris Johnson, Josie Gibson, Susanna Reid and Olivia Attwood are among the celebs rumoured to compete for the 2023 jungle crown.

While Matt would most definitely adapt well to camping under the stars, the former BBC One host has numerous other programmes keeping him busy this year. ""I've got my new series starting this Saturday. I'm also doing some more travel shows with mum and dad - they love it. And you'll still see me popping up on Countryfile,"" he said.

The 45-year-old set off on an adventure across the United States to film his latest show, and said it was an ""absolute pleasure"" to immerse himself in the lives of rural workers. ""This series has been an absolute dream for me. I grew up on a sheep farm in the Durham Dales and whenever I go on holiday, I always find myself in the rural parts, chatting to local farmers and those who work the land,"" he said. ""So I took the heartbeat of Our Farm in the Dales and I went with that same intrigue to rural farms in America.

""I met the kind of people you don't normally see on television - the quiet ones working the land and doing the best for the environment. As soon as they realised I was very much into their world, they were so open and honest with me. I never feel happier than when I'm with like-minded folk in the rural community."" The series, which runs for six weeks, sees Matt learn how to lasso, hike in the desert and dive down to coral reefs.

""There was one guy called Dusty Crum in the Everglades who catches pythons by hand after they're released from the exotic capital in Miami,"" Matt recalled. ""The show was totally unscripted. It wasn't gimmicky, it was real. They showed me a lot of skills to take back to our farm. The Miccosukee Tribe and the Colorado River Indian Tribe taught me how to irrigate the land. When you meet farmers that grow crops in the desert, it's unbelievable. When the Durham Dales turns into a desert, I'll be very well prepared.""

While the exotic fruits grown in Florida and the last remaining cheesemaker in Monterey were fascinating to Matt, he was excited to return home to regular routine farm life and his close family, wife Nicola Mooney and their two kids. ""On a typical day on the farm, we get up nice and early to let the dogs out and check over the sheep. Then we have seasonal jobs through the day, like lambing or harvesting hay, and do the afternoon feed run,"" the dad-of-two explained.

The countryside is where Matt feels most at peace as he vows to never return to city life or head back to London. ""When I first got the job on Blue Peter, I moved to London for a few months before I realised that I couldn't cope with it at all, so I very quickly moved out,"" he said, before joking: ""I've only been six months in my life without a flock of sheep, so that was the worst period of my life really.""

Not being a huge fan of cities that come with not only their hustle and bustle but pollution, Matt hopes the next destination on his future travel is somewhere far cleaner than the capital. ""I've never been to New Zealand I'd love to experience the Galapagos Islands and explore there,"" he added.

Matt Baker's Travel in the Country: USA starts Saturday, August 5, at 8.15pm on Channel 4.

Love Island farmer Will kissed Layla when the girls were away in Casa Amor, but he immediately regretted his decision and has decided to recouple with Jessie once more

Love Island's Jessie returned from Casa Amor tonight - as Will confessed to his cheating.

The farmer shared a kiss with Layla during his time away from the Australian influencer, but later admitted his regret at doing so. He apologised to Layla the day after and told her that he wanted to go back to Jessie.

The pair agreed to be friends, but it remains to be seen whether Jessie will end up finding out about what happened during their time away. Jessie remained 100 per cent loyal to Will, and insisted to her friends he would never turn his head.

Tonight, as the recoupling took place, Will admitted that he was going to be a ""broken man"" either way. He admitted he was worried about explaining to her what he did on the first night, and was also worried she might walk in with someone else.

Jessie burst into tears on realising Will was still single, before she told him she could trust him. As they sat down together, Will paused before admitting he wasn't completely loyal to her. Jessie looked fuming as he admitted ""emotions were high"". He said he struggled mentally as he felt he left himself down and her down, as he said he felt like the ""worst human"".

Admitting he had ""f**ked up big time"", Will went on to chat with Layla about their kiss on Wednesday night's show and tell the Casa Amor bombshell: ""No trust me, I'm not a player! I'm a one girl type of guy to be fair.""

However, Will's declaration didn't go down too well with those who had been watching at home, as they questioned how he could be a ""one type girl"" when he had been sharing kisses with Layla during their time in the main villa.

""I don't want to sound pessimistic but something tells me Will is NOT a one woman type of guy. Just a hunch #loveIsland,"" one fan of the show wrote on Twitter, as another added: ""Will : I'm a one woman type a guy [laughing emoji] unless you not next to me .. so whoever is in front of him it's his girl."" A third shared: ""jessie deserves so much better WHY WILL WHY YOU F***ED IT ALL UP AHHH.""

Earlier in the series, Will and Jessie went on a date at a wine cellar, and things seemed great between the pair.

""This is so stunning, you're so romantic,"" Jessie said, as Will told her: ""You look beautiful.""

Jessie then went on to say Will makes her so happy, as she admitted: ""You honestly make me so happy, no guy has ever made me feel like this,"" before he replied: ""That's literally all I want to do, as long as you're happy and you feel loved and beautiful.""

She was emotional as she told him: ""Thank you, because that's how I do feel and I've never felt that way before,"" whilst Will told her as the pair held hands: ""You've got every single trait that I would look for in a girlfriend. In the outside world I've probably been quite shut off, I think that's why I haven't formed any relationships. I'm just terrified of getting my heart broken, however with you I definitely feel a lot more comfortable and it's something that I do want to do.""

Our Yorkshire Farm fans were concerned when shepherdess Amana Owen shared snaps of her children playing on a frozen river at Ravenseat as the country battles sub-zero temperatures

Amanda Owen worried some of her fans after posting pictures of her kids playing on a frozen lake.

The Yorkshire Farm star, 48, shared snaps of her brood out on the river at Ravenseat as the country battles sub-zero temperatures.

In the pictures, her daughters look like they're having a whale of a time, skating along the frozen stream, wrapped up against the cold.

But some fans thought the ice was too dangerous for them to be playing on.

However, taking to Twitter, Amanda told her 200k followers: ""Been slipping & skating around all week, but these lot have been doing it for fun.

""The water is incredibly shallow, only wet feet would result if the ice broke.""

Other fans praised Amanda for letting her children have fun, saying: ""Looks like they're having a fabulous time! I'm sure you wouldn't let them skate on anything that looks remotely unsafe"".

The pictures come after a tough start to the year in which Amanda gets used to life without Clive after the couple announced they'd split last year.

The mother-of-nine shares Raven, Reuben, Miles, Edith, Violet, Sidney, Annas, Clementine and Nancy, aged from 21 to five with her estranged-husband and admitted farming life had its challenges.

Speaking to us about her new show Farming Lives in which she visits farm across the country, she said: ""Life has its challenges, whether that's in media-land or on the farm. You have to adapt and change over time, don't you?

""It's never easy, it's different challenges. But I must admit I do like being a part of their journey as they grow up and seeing them develop.

""Raven is away at university doing a Masters now, Reuben's working independently and loving it, Miles has left school and is working at home. It brings in new people and keeps you on your toes. I hope it keeps me young.""

With her stunning looks and outdoor lifestyle, Amanda looks years younger than her age.

She's usually seen in wellies and without a scrap of make-up - but did confess she loves a false eyelash.

""I enjoy being not what people expect,"" she revealed.

""I hate the idea of stereotyping. I might be 6ft 2in and work on the farm, but I can wear heels, stick on false eyelashes and be totally happy talking to a bunch of hill farmers while I'm doing it.""

Despite suggestions Clarkson's Farm could be cancelled following Jeremy Clarkson's grim comments about Meghan Markle, the former Top Gear host has been speaking about the second instalment

Jeremy Clarkson says it's been a 'year of total and absolute disasters' - and not just because of the furious fallout to his vile Meghan Markle rant.

The outspoken 62-year-old has detailed his struggles ahead of the second instalment of Clarkson's Farm on Prime Video.

Jeremy is back in his wellies and revving up the tractor ahead of the show's return and he says it's been a challenging 12 months.

The former Top Gear presenter wrote in his newspaper column that he wanted the Duchess of Sussex to be ""paraded naked through the streets"" where he ""dreams of people throwing lumps of excrement at her"".

He added: ""Everyone who's my age thinks the same way"".

Both he and The Sun have apologised - and it lead to question marks over the future of Clarkson's Farm.

The TV star says he emailed the Duke and Duchess on Christmas Day to apologise and say his language in the column had been ""disgraceful"" and that he was ""profoundly sorry"".

In an interview ahead of the programme's return next month, Jeremy accepts it's been rough time - but mainly because of his cows.

He said prior to the controversy: ""You put cows in a field. They keep the grass down.

""They turn the grass into manure, effectively. And then you keep them in a very small area of the field, so they eat every bit of grass and cover every square inch with faeces.

""The next day you move them, and you put hens where the cows were, and the hens eat the worms out of the cow s***, and then trample the cow s*** and their own s*** into the fields.

""So, you fertilise it using natural stuff, rather than chemical nitrates, which is what you used to do.

""I thought: ""Right! Well, I'll get some cows."" But I don't know anything about cow farming. Literally nothing at all.

""It's been a year of total disasters on the cow front. Absolute disasters, because I didn't know anything.

""I shouldn't have had cows. It was a mad thing to have got.""

The series, which will follow another year in the life of Diddly Squat Farm in Chipping Norton, sees Clarkson return as the amateur farmer with big ideas.

In his attack on the royals, Jeremy also claimed that Prince Harry was once a dim but fun-loving guy but Meghan's ""vivid bedroom promises [turned] him into a warrior of woke"", adding that she was now controlling him like a glove puppet.

His comments have been widely slammed, both from other celebrities and members of the public who are astounded by the inflammatory views shared by Jeremy - who has two grown-up daughters.

Clarkson's Farm series 2 launches on Prime Video on Friday February 10.

Love Island stars Jessie Wynter and Will Young have shunned the glitzy London life for life on the farm as she moves in with her beau's family in Buckinghamshire

Love Island stars Jessie Wynter and Will Young appeared to make a dig at their co-stars in a recent interview.

The Australian personal trainer and her farmer beau are currently living low-key with beau Will on his family's Buckinghamshire farm.

And the pair, who both admit to being country bumpkins, look like they couldn't be happier living on the farm.

Jessie has been spotted cuddling sheep and donning her wellies as she gets stuck into life in the country.

And the 26-year-old admits she prefers this to living a glitzy life in London, like some of her Love Island pals.

In a chat with OK! the Tasmanian-born reality star said: ""I'm all settled in. It's really nice getting out of London and back to the countryside that I'm used to.

""I think it's been really good for mine and Will's relationship to just settle back into the normal world instead of trying to be in London and living that high life.""

Jessie's comments follow reports of a feud with some of their Love Island co-stars since leaving the ITV show.

Tensions ran high with Olivia Hawkins after she branded Jessie and Will's relationship ""˜fake' in the villa.

There were also rumours Will was no longer as close to boys Casey O'Gorman and Tom Clare, who were dubbed ""˜The Three Muskateers', after they were spotted meeting up without him.

Speaking on The Useless Hotline Podcast, Will shared: ""I was pretty close with Tom and Casey in the villa, you know, the three musketeers! But kind of outside me and Jessie are just focusing on ourselves.""

Jessie added: ""We've been out on the farm, it's really hard, they're all like 'Come to Manchester' and it's like babe we're so far away! It would take us a day to get there.""

The speculation continued as Casey visited Tom in Barnsley, without Will.

However, a spokesperson for Tom told the Mirror: ""There is no feud between the Three Musketeers, since coming out of the villa all of them have been busy and they look forward to reuniting soon. There's regular contact between all three.""

Jessie also addressed her spat with Olivia and said although the pair will probably never be great friends, they had spoken since the show.

She said: ""We saw each other on the Aftersun reunion very briefly. She did send me a message.

""Before she left the villa I gave her a hug because, while she did hurt my feelings, I did really appreciate our friendship. It's a bittersweet situation. I don't want to hold on to the grudge, but I was hurt from it.""

The TV star, who also appeared on the Australian version of Love Island in 2019, says she couldn't be happier with 23-year-old Will and revealed ""sex is a million times better"" outside the show.

Although they didn't win - getting knocked out in fifth place just before the final - Jessie confessed her and Will see marriage and kids in their future.

Agreeing, Will added: ""I wouldn't be with her if I thought she wasn't marriage material. Our plan is to split our time between the UK and Tasmania.""

A family in Wisconsin has suffered the ultimate loss after an alleged drunk driver slammed into an SUV containing four siblings during their time Christmas shopping, leaving Daniel Gonzalez, 26, Fabian Gonzalez, 23 Lilian Gonzalez, 14, and Daniela Gonzalez, 9, dead

A community in Wisconsin has been left heartbroken after an alleged drunk driver slammed into a car containing four siblings on their way out Christmas shopping, killing everyone in the car.

Daniel Gonzalez, 26, Fabian Gonzalez, 23 Lilian Gonzalez, 14, and Daniela Gonzalez, 9, were killed by a drunk driver on December 16 in Weyauwega, about 100 miles northwest of Milwaukee.

Police arrested Scott Farmer, 47, shortly after the incident, and have charged him with four counts of homicide by intoxicated use of vehicle, one count of operating while intoxicated, and one count of operating while revoked, causing death.

""My wife will never be the same, but with strength, we will be good,"" said Kurt Schilling, the victims' stepfather. The Gonzalez family told WLUK the siblings were only about three miles from returning home after going out together. ""All were beyond lifesaving measures and were pronounced deceased at the scene,"" the first responding officer, Waupaca County Capt. Todd G. Rasmussen, wrote in a criminal complaint.

The child's mother, Paulina, immigrated from Ecuador, and had a combined family with Schilling, who treated all four like his own. Schilling also has four children from a previous marriage of his own. ""Our house was a true home. Very blessed by God and by being a very united family,"" Kurt Schilling said. ""And we're a very close family.""

In an interview with Fox 11, Paulina revealed her boys, 25-year old Daniel Gonzalez and 23-year old Fabian Gonzalez, loved music. She said, ""They both spent a lot of time together because they worked together on the same schedule."" Lilian Gonzalez, 14, was a freshman at Weyauwega-Fremont High School. Her mom said, ""Lilian wanted to be a teacher."" Daniela Gonzalez, 9, was in the fourth grade. ""She loved and really wanted to be a cheerleader,"" said her mother.

According to a criminal complaint, Farmer had previous arrests and stops for driving under the influence, and police were informed of a car going the wrong way on a street just minutes before the crash. The complaint, written by the first responder on the scene, Deputy Malueg, further states that a bottle of vodka was found next to Farmer in the front seat. Malueg wrote that there was a ""strong odor of intoxicants"" and Farmer had ""thick, slurred, speech.""

Farmer is now facing a $25,000 fine per charge, and may be sentenced to serve 10 years in prison, in accordance with Wisconsin state laws. Kurt Shilling told interviewers, ""All I would say is, that he and all people who might drink for many bad reasons, to excess, or other drugs, would be responsible and think of others, because you really destroyed our lives.""

The parents added that the kids were on their way back from a weekly outing. ""The big brothers would always treat their sisters to Culver's and then drop them off here, go to bed, be in church in the morning, that kind of thing. It was the Saturday tradition,"" Kurt Schilling said.

Two people drove up to the scene before officers arrived, and checked on the children in the car, providing officers with updates and ensuring they got an ambulance. ""Knowing that they were all siblings was just heart-wrenching and we just wanted to hug everyone, offer our condolences and let them know that we were there holding their hands, whether they were helped or not,"" Shelby Strahl said.

""Their children were not alone and they were being given great praises and wake up and we were there,"" added Strahl's twin sister, Farah Krueger.

The Tinkers Bubble commune is in 40 acres of Somerset countryside houses a group who get by making their own cider and farming cows

An off-grid community hidden in part of the English countryside sees its residents pay just £120-a-mont for their eco-lifestyle.

The Tinkers Bubble commune is in 40 acres of Somerset countryside and houses a group who get by making their own cider and farming cows.

While the communal home currently houses nine residents, numbers have fluctuated since it opened in the mid 1990s.

The commune comprises of eight self-built houses, made from wood, straw, cob walls and reeds recycled from local thatched cottages.

Since its creation the commune has seen eight babies born as part of the community which aims to live self-sufficiently.

One residents, Alex, told Positive.News: ""Most of our food is grown or killed by us. Our fuel is wood we've chopped. It feels empowering, we're not reliant on shops.""

Alex, a former civil engineer, relocated to the west country commune two years ago after starting as a volunter.

They explained the lure of the eco-commune, claiming to challenges around mental health and isolation in urban society, adding: ""If I look at the crises of modernity, there's so many aspects, whether it is loneliness, mental health, housing, access to food, climate change - life here provides an answer to a lot of that stuff in one go.""

Most that live in Tinkers Bubble in their late-20s to mid-30s, as the strenuous work required to upkeep the commune does not suit older people, Alex said.

The commune has two cows, which are milked by the residents. They also have chickens and grow much of their other food.

They manage around 28 acres of woodland, used to create their own fuel.

Thousands of tonnes of dried haricot beans are imported to the UK each week by the major brands - but all that could change with new hope for growers

Farmers and scientists are optimistic Britain can start growing our own baked beans.

Until now, it has been impossible for farmers to grow the haricot variety used for baked beans in the UK because of our climate.

But scientists have developed a seed they hope will allow the plants to thrive after a 12-year project.

""It's crazy shipping a bean halfway around the world,"" Prof Tim Lang said.

Thousands of tonnes of dried haricot beans are imported to the UK each week by the major brands, coming from the US, Canada, Ethiopia and China.

""It's the first commercial scale planting of a variety of haricot beans that could end up in a can on everybody's supper table,"" said Andrew Ward, the farmer growing the beans in Lincolnshire.

""At the moment we don't have any beans that are grown here that are suitable for baked beans, our climate isn't right for producing this type of bean.""

The seeds sown mark the latest phase of the research by the University of Warwick who developed seeds which can be sown in early May and harvested as a dry grain before mid-September, matching the UK's warmer months.

Prof Eric Holub, from the university's Life Sciences department, said: ""The work that I have been involved with started in 2011, but actually it was inherited material that had been used here on the university farm in the 1970s and 80s.

""It was put into storage, and it was 2011 that I realised that there was some valuable material and I started reviving it.""

A smaller scale trial in 2022 failed due to the summer heatwave, with hopes this current crop being grown in Leadenham near Lincoln will be ready to harvest in late August.

""We've seen empty supermarket shelves over the last few months"", said Mr Ward.

""That's down to the problem that we don't grow enough of our food, ourselves, here.""

Some health food brands have attempted to market British-grown fava beans as ""˜baked beans', but they have lacked mass appeal due to the difference in taste to haricots.

Prof Lang from City, University of London, said it was ""very important"" the project succeeded.

""It has been a desperate desire of the British food industry and baked bean manufacturers to have a British baked bean for decades,"" he said.

""When I started in food policy 40 years ago, people were wanting this.

""It's crazy shipping a little bean halfway round the world just to put it in a tin can with some tomato sauce.""

Today in the UK we get through more than two million cans of baked beans every day...more than the rest of the world.

The Heinz factory in Wigan - the largest baked bean factory in the world - makes more than three million cans of beans every 24 hours.

They were first introduced in 1901 by an American man, Henry Heinz, owner of the Heinz food company.

In 1905, Mr Heinz started to advertise his baked beans as the perfect pre-cooked meal at the end of a long day in a factory. They were instantly popular.

Baked beans get their name because the raw haricot beans are baked in tomato sauce while inside the can.

Originally the recipe included small pieces of pork, however during World War 2, they became vegetarian because of meat rationing.

Love Island winner Kai Fagan has broken his silence on Will Young's alleged feud with his former housemates after the Buckinghamshire farmer unfollowed multiple castmates on social media

Kai Fagan has addressed the alleged feud between Will Young and his fellow Winter Love Island contestants, admitting that his former reality TV co-star is 'doing his own thing' now that the season is over.

Will hit headlines in August after unfollowing a number of people who starred alongside him on the ITV series in January, in what appeared to be a savage swipe against his ex roommates in the South Africa villa. The 23-year-old has reportedly now disconnected from his castmates altogether, after coming to blows with former besties Casey and Tom in the house and subsequently being snubbed from their group chat

Kai, who won the season with Sanam Harrinanan, has now made a brief comment about his current relationship with his former castmates, including the divisive Buckinghamshire farmer.

""I speak to them when I see them, and when I see them at events we catch up on group chats, but everyone is doing their own thing. Will seems like he's doing himself,"" he told the Sun at the Pride of Britain Awards in London on Sunday evening.

""There is still a Whatsapp group but obviously Will has had a bit of a disagreement with a few of the boys, but apart from that I have no animosity towards Will, we got on, but we weren't best friends.""

It's no secret that the 23-year-old, who finished in fifth place alongside Jessie Wynter on the January edition of the ITV reality series, left the show on bitter terms with other castmates.

Rumours of a feud date back to a February 2023 episode of Winter Love Island, which saw Tom Casey and Casey O'Gorman accusing Jessie of faking her feelings for Will. Their comments, in turn, prompted the farming expert to confront his mates on the matter, which only exacerbated tensions in the villa.

Casey immediately denied he'd badmouthed Jessie, even going as far as to contradict his previous statements altogether and insist he actually thought she was 'genuine'. This exchange left viewers of the show fuming, with many taking to social media to slam the recruitment consultant as insincere.

""Did Casey just lie to Will? I'm sure we all watched him speak to Tom & Samie AND Maxwell about Jessie not being genuine?"" one frustrated viewer wrote.

Will said he was ""livid"" over the situation, fuming on the aftershow: ""I said so many times, be honest with me, be open with me and the boy lied.""

He has since unfollowed both Casey and Tom, as well as Ron and Kai, on Instagram. Will explained that he made this decision to disconnect after realizing he'd been removed from their group chat on the same night that the boys went out for dinner without him.

""I was invited but I couldn't go - I live out of the city, I'm working on the farm and focusing on my girlfriend. They had their dinner and from what I saw on their [Instagram] stories had a couple of drinks, had a good time and then later that night Ron removed me from the group chat,"" he told Heatworld. ""I was really confused but I sat back and thought, you've got four people sat at a table, a conversation about me would have happened, I don't know what is it, so although Ron removed me I think it was a whole group situation.""

Thirteen members of the same family have died in Namibia after eating porridge that authorities believe became toxic when it was mixed with sediment left over from a homemade beer, the state broadcaster reported

Thirteen members of the same family have died in Namibia after being poisoned with toxic porridge, with the youngest victim aged just two-years-old.

Authorities believe the staple breakfast dish was tainted after it was mixed with sediment left over from homemade beer, according to state broadcaster, the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation.

NBC added that another four people are in hospital in critical condition.

Quoting the Namibian health ministry, NBC reported that the ""poisonous or toxic"" porridge was ingested by at least 20 people.

It had been mixed with a fermented substance left over from a homemade alcoholic drink.

The victims ranged in age from two to 33, NBC said.

The incident happened in the Kavango East region in the far north-east of the country.

Earlier this year, a shocking ""mass poisoning"" incident happened in Gujarat, when at least 28 people were killed after ingesting fatal levels of methanol.

In the Ahmedabad and Botad districts of Guajarat in India, methyl alcohol was used to make booze that was extremely strong according to police.

A permit is needed for the consumption of alcohol in Gujarat and it cannot be bought or sold in the state. Reports say that victims, mostly agriculture and sanitary workers, did not seek help for fear of arrest after the consumption of alcohol.

Bhavnagar Ashok Yadav, inspector general of police, told The Times of India: ""There was 98% methanol in the liquor they consumed, that means they had consumed methanol only which has increased the death toll.""

Police also said they had arrested ""several"" people involved for alleged sale of ""spurious liquor."" Narol's Jayesh Khavadiya was arrested along with eight other people.

They were also forced to form 100 teams of people to go to surrounding villages and makes sure anyone who had ingested the alcohol was admitted to hospital for treatment.

The state has experienced frequent problems with booze and this is not the first time it has experienced several deaths from the sale of black-market alcohol.

Joe Lewis is facing a federal prosecution for insider trading, as the Tottenham owner became the latest billionaire to be investigated by authorities in the United States

British billionaire and owner of Tottenham Hotspur, Joe Lewis, is facing charges of insider trading in the United States.

The 86-year-old is the latest businessman to be under threat from federal prosecutors following a crackdown on insider trading investigations, according to Bloomberg. In a federal indictment in New York, it was alleged by prosecutors that Lewis shared information from companies to friends, partners and also his personal employees.

""Today I'm announcing that my office, the Southern District of New York has indicted Joe Lewis, the British billionaire, for orchestrating a brazen insider trading scheme,"" Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement Tuesday.

""We allege that for years Joe Lewis abused access to corporate board rooms and repeatedly provided inside information to his romantic partners, his personal assistants, his pilots and his friends. None of this was necessary, Joe Lewis was a wealthy man.

""But as we allege he used inside information as a way to compensate his employees or shower gifts on his friends and lovers."" Lewis now faces more than a dozen charges, including securities fraud and conspiracy.

A Tottenham spokesperson told Football London on Wednesday: ""This is a legal matter unconnected with the club and as such we have no comment.""

Prosecutors believe he was involved in insider trading for eight years from 2013 to 2021, and in doing so passed on non-public information about multiple companies. These alleged companies include Solid Biosciences, Australian Agricultural Co. and Mirati Therapeutics.

Lewis reportedly loaned money to those he shared the sensitive information with, the authorities say. The octogenarian has a net worth of £5billion, a figure that's soared due to the valuation of Tottenham.

Lewis has been involved in currency trading for a number of decades and also is an investor in Tavistock Group, which owns more than 200 companies in 15 countries. The recent crackdown in Manhattan has seen 10 people in four cases have charges filed against them.

Calls and emails to Tavistock's media team are yet to be returned, following Tuesday's news. The charges come just days after Lewis reportedly told Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy that he must sell striker Harry Kane this summer or agree terms with the England international on a new contract.

Tottenham have refused bids from Bayern Munich this summer as they look to hold on to their record goalscorer. But Kane is out of contract next summer, and face him walking away from the club for free. Bayern have offered a transfer fee in the region of £80million to take him off their hands.

Levy has remained firm over his stance of wanting to keep Kane at the club and says that the striker is still not for sale. Kane is still yet to win a professional trophy throughout his career, and pushed to leave the club back in 2021.

Kilnsey Crag - a ­well-known climbing hotspot that is 170ft-high and has a 40ft overhang - is up for grabs along with the 19 acres of land it stands on in the Yorkshire Dales

How about this for a high-end purchase""¦ a cliff has gone on sale for £150,000.

Kilnsey Crag is up for grabs along with the 19 acres of land it stands on in the Yorkshire Dales.

It is one of the national park's best-known spots, which features on countless postcards and was painted by JMW Turner in 1816.

The 170ft-high crag, which has a 40ft overhang, is a also ­well-known climbing hotspot.

Agents Savills said: ""The sale represents a genuinely unique opportunity to purchase one of the Big Three limestone crags in the Yorkshire Dales National Park.

""The overhanging cliff, formed by the force of the Wharfedale Glacier thousands of years ago, is awe-inspiring.""

Kilnsey Crag is a limestone cliff that dominates the drive into Upper Wharfedale.

The sale details point out that the cliff and surrounding ­grassland is teeming with rare flora and fauna and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

A local farmer is selling the crag and land, which is designated as open access by law. Savills added: ""The sale offers significant amenity, ­biodiversity, and ­environmental opportunities.""

Kilnsey Crag's overhang which, along with its proximity to the main road through Wharfedale, has made it one of the most ­challenging and popular ­rock climbing locations in the north of England.

It is also the backdrop to the annual Kilnsey Agricultural Show. That culminates in the British Open Fell Running Association fell race.

The other two limestone crags in the Dales are Gordale Scar and Malham Cove.

Kaleb Cooper is set to tie-the-knot with his fiancÃ©e Taya - who he has been engaged to for almost a year and shares two young children aged two years and four months with

Clarkson's Farm star Kaleb Cooper has given an update about his upcoming wedding to fiancÃ©e Taya - and it sounds like the pair will be tying-the-knot with efficient style.

The 25-year-old TV star has become a runaway star of 63-year-old Jeremy Clarkson's Amazon Prime show which follows his trials and tantrums while trying to turn his farm in the Cotswolds into a success. Kaleb has been engaged to Taya for almost a year and two-year-old son named Oscar - and welcomed a daughter named Willa in June.

Following the birth of their second child, it seems Taya made the decision to increase efforts to plan her and Kaleb's wedding - and she wasted literally no time in booking a venue. In an interview with the Express, Kaleb shared details about the fast advancing wedding plans.

He revealed: ""She did say that as soon as the second baby is born she'd be planning this wedding. About 20 seconds after delivering the baby, she says 'Right, wedding planning, should we have it here or here?' She's already booked the venue! So yeah, she's smashing it!""

And it seems Taya is just as accomplished when it comes to running the Cooper household. Kaleb said: ""No matter what happens or how late I have to work, she's always helping at home, whether it's just by saying 'Dinner's on the table when you get in, let me know when you're coming back,' or the kids have had a bath and are in bed.""

Earlier this month, while promoting his new book - titled Britain According to Kaleb: The Wonderful World of Country Life - the Clarkson's Farm opened up to the Mirror about his new life in the spotlight. He said: ""I don't think it changed me at all, I think I'm still the same person as in season one, I've just got a bit of a beard now and I've got four-and-half chest hairs, and two kids.

""It doesn't matter if you get As or Us, or if you don't do GCSEs at all. I did okay on my GCSEs, and I went to agriculture apprenticeship. I got two of them and it went well and I'm where I am today.""

Meanwhile, Jeremy's girlfriend Lisa Hogan has hinted that fans of Clarkson's Farm will soon have more episodes available to binge on. She posted a photograph of herself on the farm and revealed that filming of the third season was nearing an end.

She wrote in a caption: ""Penultimate week #clarksonsfarm #tractor #amazonprime."" Her post sparked a flurry of questions from fans - with more details about the show's future being leaked as a result.

One fan asked: ""When is season 3 being aired?' with Lisa confirming: ""Once they edit!"" Another fan enquired: ""Hopefully not the penultimate week of the penultimate season,"" to which Lisa replied: ""...nope"". Meanwhile another viewer quizzed: ""And season 4??"" to which the actress responded with a thumbs up emoji.

Canadian entrepreneur Michael Henderson plans to erect a 274-metre (900ft) sphere in Dubai which will replicate walking on the moon as part of his ambitious £4billion project

A Dubai resort hopes to build a giant replica of the moon on top of a skyscraper costing over £4billion.

Canadian entrepreneur Michael Henderson plans to erect a 274-metre (900ft) sphere on top of a 30 metre (100ft) building in the United Arab Emirates city state.

It is already home to the world's tallest building, among other architectural wonders.

The project - called MOON - would essentially provide the experience of visiting the space satellite without having to leave Earth.

And hopes to attract over 2.5million guests annually.

It is estimated that the attraction could bring in over £1.5billion in a single year.

The scheme - likely to cost £4.28 billion - is being funded by Moon World Resorts Inc, of which Henderson is the co-founder.

He said: ""We have the biggest 'brand' in the world.

""Eight billion people know our brand, and we haven't even started yet.""

The project would include a resort inside the spherical structure, complete with a 4,000-room hotel, an arena with 10,000 capacity, a nightclub and wellness centre.

A 'lunar colony', meanwhile, would allow guests to experience what it would actually feel like to walk on the moon.

The structure would be placed on a pedestal-like building and would glow at night as a full, half or crescent moon.

Earlier this month, Henderson talked about his plans at the Arabian Travel Market in Dubai.

In a previous statement, he and co-founder Sandra G Matthews said Moon Dubai will ""significantly impact every aspect of the UAE's economy, including tourism"".

Also targeted are ""transportation, commercial and residential real estate, infrastructure, financial services, aviation and space, energy, MICE, agriculture, technology and of course education"".

They continued: ""[It] will be the largest and most successful modern-day tourism project in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, doubling annual tourism visitations to Dubai based on its global appeal, brand awareness and unique multiple integrated offerings.""

The city already boasts the UAE's space centre, which has sent a probe to Mars and unsuccessfully tried to put a rover on the moon.

Henderson's project would be a step further than the MSG Sphere, a $2.3billion dome blanketed by LED screens, due to launch in Las Vegas this year.

Plans to build another MSG Sphere in London were scrapped after locals protested about the light pollution and disruption it would cause.

Henderson responded: ""It's hard to please everybody.

""You might need dark curtains.""

Jeremy sparked a deafening backlash last December when he wrote a poisoned letter in The Sun where he expressed his wish to strip Meghan naked and parade her through the streets

Amazon Studios have defended their decision not to cancel Clarkson's Farm following a spectacular backlash against show star Jeremy Clarkson last year after he penned a toxic article about Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex.

The wildly popular rural reality show has been an unexpected hit for Amazon Prime - the streaming service that supplies films and TV shows to subscribers. The series follows 63-year-old Jeremy as he tries to build a successful business out of a farm he bought in Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire.

Jeremy's partner Lisa Hogan, 48, and business associates Kaleb Cooper, 25, and Charlie 'Cheerful Charlie' Ireland star in the show which has run for two seasons so far. But last year, Jeremy sparked a furious backlash when he wrote an article in The Sun where he expressed a wish to see 42-year-old Meghan ""paraded naked through the streets"" as he dislikes her so much.

The poisoned column led to ITV to consider cutting their ties with Jeremy over hosting Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? While Amazon themselves reportedly decided to cancel The Grand Tour - the car show that Jeremy hosts alongside James May, 60 and Richard Hammond, 53.

The future of Clarkson's Farm also looked to be in question as some reports suggested Amazon planned to only air episodes of both The Grand Tour and Clarkson's Farm that had already been filmed before cutting ties entirely with Jeremy in 2024. But now bosses have confirmed Clarkson's farm will go ahead with a third season.

Speaking at the Edinburgh TV Festival at the EICC, Fozia Khan, unscripted lead, UK Originals for Amazon Studios and Dan Grabiner, head of originals for UK and Northern Europe, Amazon Studios, said the show is a ""phenomenon"" and has had an ""impact"" on the agricultural and farming industries.

While bosses remarked they were ""shocked and disappointed"" following Jeremy's article about Meghan, but argued they made the decision to carry on production as there is ""so much more to the show than Clarkson"".

In February it was reported by Deadline that Clarkson's Farm became ""Amazon Prime Video's most-watched original show in the UK"" when it began streaming that month.

Jeremy himself had defended the analogy he had used of parading Meghan naked through the streets as a dated reference to the fantasy drama Game of Thrones. In a 2015 season five episode of the HBO series, an evil queen was stripped and forced to walk through the streets of a city while the public were invited to hurl insults and excrement at her.

He also denied speculation he had been fired as the host of Who Want's To Be A Millionaire?, tweeting in March: ""So many kind messages about today's reports. But relax... I have not been sacked as host of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.""

Rachel Elnaugh, who was one of the five investors in the first two seasons of the hit BBC show, intends to turn the land into an eco-farm and retreat for followers of her group who believe in a 'food apocalypse' and the 'great reset'

A former Dragon's Den star has hit back after being ordered to tear down a controversial 'anti-vaxxer sanctuary' in the Peak District.

Rachel Elnaugh was one of the original five investors and starred in the first two seasons of the hit BBC show, alongside Duncan Bannatyne, Simon Woodroffe, Peter Jones and Doug Richard.

But her business, Red Letter Days, floundered and was carved up by her fellow dragons, and since then she's slipped out of the limelight - but it turns out she's been busy.

She purchased 70 acres of protected land including ancient trees and unimproved grassland in Cressbrook Dale, a limestone gorge near Bakewell, Derbyshire, which she refers to as an ""incredible vagina of land"".

Her declared intentions with the land have changed over time, and locals fear she intends to turn it into an eco-farm and retreat for followers of her group, the ""Inner Sanctum"", who believe in a ""food apocalypse"" and the ""great reset"".

But the supposed plan came undone when the Peak National Park Authority issued an official enforcement notice stating the group had to return the land to its original state.

Now Rachel has hit back at a local campaign group, Save Cressbrook Dale, stating the council's intervention is a result of a 'hate campaign' by the group.

Do you remember Rachel Elnaugh? Let us know in the comments...

Speaking to the Mirror, Rachel said: ""I am dismayed at the depths to which the Cressbrook local community have stopped in what is now clearly a hate campaign directed at me personally.

""I am currently compiling evidence for a private prosecution of those involved.

""I am not authorised to comment on behalf of the co-owners, some of whom are elderly with walking disabilities - however I do wonder whether their right - to freely and safely access the land which they own - have been considered by those attempting to deny those rights?""

The notice, seen by The Mirror, states that there has been a breach of planning protocol on the land, and a vehicle parking area, some steps, a path, and a tipi must be removed.

The notice goes on to describe the land in question as a part of a 'natural zone', subject to specific restrictions.

A spokesperson for the Save Cressbrook Dale group said: ""We see it as the right thing - the quote that is in the notice about the importance of the landscape and maintaining access is what our campaign has all been about, so it's validation of that really.

""She has the right of appeal and she could appeal the notice, it's hard to know what motivates her and how she works.

""The notice means she has to remove everything noted in the enforcement notice - the steps, the parking, the teepee, there are a few things that have been left out like the caravan and the pond that they put in - they have been left out of the enforcement notice, we are talking to peak park about that.""

Rachel Elnaugh became a celebrity of sorts when she appeared on the BBC game show where she competed to invest in new businesses alongside her fellow dragons.

The businesswoman, who starred in the first two series of the show and was initially the only female investor, founded Red Letter Days in 1989 which became a whopping success with a turnover of £18m.

But it eventually faltered and she was ' forced out ' of the show, before her company finally went into administration leaving behind a series of unpaid suppliers and disappointed customers.

Since then she aired her controversial views on the Covid vaccination programme - and sparked outrage when she called for Chris Whitty to hang, calling jabs of 12-15-year-olds ""child abuse"".

She also snapped up the ancient and protected woodland in the Peak District, angering locals and the local authority in the process.

John Butler, chair of the Cressbrook community group and lead spokesperson for the Save Cressbrook Dale campaign, previously spoke to The Mirror.

He has lived in the area for the past 50 years and regularly enjoyed walking through the dale - which he described as a ""crown jewel of the Peak District National Park"" - but he fears for its future.

He said: ""It's not clear what she intends to do with the land, it seems to be changing.

""The original intention that was expressed was to establish a self-sufficient eco-community on the land.

""They had a million-pound business plan in order to bring that to fruition, which included quite a lot of infrastructure that they were going to install, including wind turbines, greenhouses and polytunnels, alongside £90,000 worth of movable structures.

""So at that point, it looked like they were building a settlement on the land. However, it was clear right from the outset that the land is simply not fit for that purpose.

""It's not fertile agricultural land, most of it is ancient woodland, there's 70 acres altogether and 50 are just woodland.

""Some is marginal grazing land, it's very poor soil and unimproved land, so it's never been cultivated in a serious way - so it's not remotely capable of producing viable crops for a self-sufficient community.""

In a letter, Rachel explained to local residents that she had bought the land and stated that she wanted to ""get as much as we can planted for this growing season.""

She stated that it was her intention to ""create a fully self-sustaining 'food-apocalypse-proof' site"", and invited them to ""be part of our growing community of open-hearted souls"".

Rachel's prospectus states that her aim is to ""build a better world"" away from ""polarization of rich and poor"" (sic) and ""ecological devastation"".

After obtaining the land, Rachel posted on Facebook: ""Given the predicted food apocalypse, one of our first priorities will be to create a food forest across the land to nourish the entire Cressbrook community.""

In one version of the prospectus, that has been seen by The Mirror, she encourages people to invest the project, stating that for anything from £20,000 up to £100,000 you could become a ""founding freeholder"".

This entitles the investor to ""access to Cressbrook Dale Estate for yourself and your immediate family"", alongside ""rights to any produce of the land"", including ""wood, vegetables, foraging, natural water"".

The prospectus states that these rights ""will continue, in perpetuity, for the heirs/descendants of the founding Freeholders.""

The document also hints at the structure of the organisation, with ""potentially thousands"" of micro freeholders on the outside of the sphere, or bottom of the pyramid, 15-55 elite ""founding freeholders"", and a group of six who make up the ""Core Mandala""

It states: ""The Core Mandala (aka Phoenix Rose) is the group of six women who both held the vision to manifest this land, as well as being committed to investing, plus having a future involvement in the ongoing management/enhancement of Cressbrook Dale Estate.

""Micro-Freeholders are by-invitation-only visitors over time who will enjoy limited rights to access, for example, a weekend's camping or a shamanic retreat - ensuring that Cressbrook Dale Estate may be enjoyed by many thousands of people over the years, in return for a reasonable amount of financial resources.""

The Core Mandala consists of Rachel Elnaugh, Janet Spence, Leila Rose, Mog Fry, Angela Harrison, and Davina Mackail.

On her website, Rachel writes about the ""Inner Sanctum"", which is on the quest to establish ""several eco-communities across the UK"" where people pool their resources to acquire land.

She wrote: ""I am delighted to let you know that on June 7, 2022, we acquired Cressbrook Dale Estate - a breathtaking c70 acre site near to Monsal Head in the Peak District National Park, Derbyshire UK.

""This opportunity came about quite by chance via one of our local Bakewell 'Stand in the Park' regulars who knew the estate management team at Stanton Estate.

""They had acquired the land when the Cressbrook Mill went bankrupt in the 1930's, had found it difficult to manage, but wanted it to go to a good home.

""The opportunity necessitated a complete shift in our initial vision - as although all c50 acres of forest and c20 acres of pastureland is agricultural there are no farm buildings on site.

""However it is rich in all the resources required for self-sustainability with natural springs plenty of wood and sheltered from the harsher elements of weather.

""We're managing it remotely for now and hope to rent or buy properties in the area as a closer base for those wishing to be on-site more regularly.""

The website also included the words to the 'prayer of the seven galactic directions', and went on to explain how she made a spiritual offering to the land.

Previously, Rachel spoke out about the Covid-19 vaccination program, and in 2021 she sparked outrage when she called for Chris Whitty to hang, calling the vaccination of 12-15-year-olds ""child abuse"".

Some locals believe the ""inner sanctum"" is a cult where people believe the UK is heading to a food apocalypse.

John added previously: ""What you and I might think of as a cult, people within might think of it as a loving community, certainly she was talking to an audience who had feared apocalyptic change for sure, and were attracted by the thought of some kind of retreat from that.

""She's a very persuasive speaker, she's imbued with the full range of conspiracy theories, and she's very good at regurgitating them and connecting them into one overarching conspiracy. If you're susceptible to that kind of spin, she's very convincing. If you try and analyse what she's saying, it all unravels very quickly.

""She's very skilful at handling any rejection of her point of view, for instance, her expressed view about the covid vaccination program was that that was a conspiracy to insert microprocessors in us, in order to conduct a world population cull.

""If you take a deep breath and think now hang on a minute, there will be many of us that have a bit of anxiety about that, but that leading you to an idea that the world economic forum is organising a program of extermination or a population cull is many steps too far for me.

""She's monetised the threat, and she's done that through her online presence - she makes these pronouncements to people who are already worried about these things, many of us have read that stuff and think it's bonkers but some hang in there and they're clearly vulnerable to a line of argument or accumulation of arguments that don't hold water but do none the less create fear and anxiety and make people at risk.

""I think, I'm speculating and inferring from what she's saying and what she's not saying, her focus has now changed from agriculture towards an assertion to the land they've bought or in the process of buying is some sort of natural temple.

""She has very repeatedly referred to it as 'the great vagina', I think she's moving towards an esoteric healing community centre. She hasn't said that explicitly, let me make that clear.

""I think the plan would depend on the capacity for the land to become a campsite, and there are strict regulations about how much camping is permitted on this land, as well as requirements for sanitation, water supply, all that kind of thing.

Cressbrook Dale is a limestone valley and sits between Bakewell and Buxton, near Matlock, and the woodland in question is home to a rare species of moss and two types of butterfly, the Dark Green Fritillary and the White-letter Hairstreak.

It provides a unique habitat for local flora and fauna and as such, the area is subject to a Tree Preservation Order protecting the trees and woodland.

It is also designated as part of the Natural Zone, the highest level of conservation protection in the Peak District National Park.

Locals believe that all of the stated intentions of the Phoenix Rose community would require change of use planning approval, and the Peak District National Park Authority has made it clear such approval would not be granted.

But since Rachel bought it in May 2022, she put in a hard-standing car park and installed a caravan and agricultural tools including a polytunnel and a teepee, according to local residents.

The local authority warned Rachel that her activities must stop, and when she carried on they issued a Temporary Stop Notice on July 25.

A spokesperson said: ""Following concerns over the nature of activities recently undertaken on land owned in Cressbrook Dale, the Peak District National Park Authority has served a Temporary Stop Notice, issued a Tree Preservation Order and served a Planning Contravention Notice questionnaire to the landowner, who now has a statutory period to respond.

""Senior officers from both the authority's planning and ecology teams have also engaged with the landowner to discuss the works, and explain the importance of the sensitive habitats and the landscape value of the area.""

John continued: ""The Peak National Park Authority are clearly monitoring the situation, they issued the temporary stop notice, I guess they were hoping that would be sufficient to deter the new owners and I'm pretty sure that they will at some point take some enforcement action because there is some stuff on the land that has been there for six months, which is illegal.

""The trouble is it's not just our back garden, the fact is that land is heavily protected by the national park, all those items shouldn't be there, there on a piece of open access land, which means that anyone can go through anywhere they want on that land.

""It's because it is one of the last wild spaces and it supports an amazing array of natural flora and fauna. The biodiversity is remarkable there, and that's because it's been unchanged, not dug, up, not cultivated, for a very long time.

""Everything they have done to the land so far, which is clearly the beginning of their plans, has been detrimental to the land because of its fragility.

""When you look into it and think why was this land given this level of protection, what makes it so special, you see that everything they've done is quite unacceptable.""

Annie Sanderson, 66, a resident in Cressbrook, described the project as a ""disaster"". She said: ""The dale is beautiful, it is why people moved here. We were given no consultation, we just started seeing videos being posted by this group about a food apocalypse"".

On Rachel's website, she also talks about ""PsyOps"" being used to ""manipulate the masses"" and win elections, describing it as the "" day democracy died "".

Local resident Jenny Caven said: ""I think what they're doing is creating a community, that's what she's trying to sell to investors - that they will be able to support themselves when things go wrong - when they go apocalyptic.

""One of the things that is interesting, is that investors aren't investors in the original sense - they can't get their money back if they want to pull out, they're putting money into something that they believe in - they're not necessarily ever going to be able to get their money back out, so it's not a safe investment.

""She's trying to get people to put money into something that isn't a rational thing but an emotional thing.

""She bought the land for £640,000, they made an initial payment of £240,000 and according to their prospectus were scheduled to pay a further two payments of £200,000 in August and October.

""It is not clear whether those payments have been made. They set out a total investment capital requirement of £1 million. The cost of the land is £640,000 payable to Stanton Estate, £30,000 payable is fees and stamp duty with a balance of £330,000 to be raised from investors.

""It's not clear what it's for. It's a lot money for people who don't know if they'll get it back, and a lot of money to invest in infrastructure.""

Lynn Crowe, a local resident and emeritus professor of environmental management at Sheffield Hallam University, said: ""These limestone dales are the closest thing that we have to true wilderness in the area.

""They are home to different species of orchid and rare butterflies including the Dark Green Fritillary and the White-letter Hairstreak.

""The area needs to be protected as a precious last refuge for wildlife, and so that the area remains accessible to walkers and nature lovers who come to enjoy the tranquillity and solitude of the area.""

Ukrainian military spokeswoman Natalia Humeniuk told Radio Svoboda that drones did not cross into Romania but reports indicate it left two people wounded and dozens of trucks damaged

Russia has attacked a border area with NATO territory, injuring two people, melting cars and forcing the closure of a key border.

The drone attack on the port of Izmail forced the Orlivka-Isaccea border crossing, which links the country with Romania, to close. Ukrainian military spokeswoman Natalia Humeniuk told Radio Svoboda that drones did not cross into Romania but reports indicate it left two people wounded and dozens of trucks damaged. Footage of the strike shows a fireball engulfing the cargo terminal as the cameraman dives for cover.

Photographs show smouldering, mangled frames of what appeared to be trucks, some of them covered in large amounts of firefighting foam. A port building, storage facilities and more than 30 trucks and cars were damaged in the two-hour attack, regional governor Oleh Kiper said. ""The operation of the Orlivka ferry crossing point has been temporarily suspended. Now, there are measures to stabilize the operation after the night attack of the enemy. We will inform you about the resumption of crossing operations,"" the State Border Service of Ukraine announced.

Izmail is a port on the Danube River and has been one of the main exit routes of Ukrainian agricultural products since Moscow ended the grain deal. It is not the first time Russia has done such a thing, as western regions near Poland have repeatedly been hit in airstrikes, while Bulgaria destroyed a device attached to a drone that landed on its territory this month.

It was the second day in a row of attacks on ports in the Odesa region. Russian drone and missile strikes damaged an abandoned hotel, a grain silo and killed two people who were buried in the rubble of a grain warehouse in the Black Sea port city, Ukrainian officials said. Russian attacks elsewhere were blamed for killing six other civilians in the past day in Ukraine.

Ukraine's air force reported downing all Russian drones launched overnight, but one of 12 Kalibr missiles and two P-800 Oniks cruise missiles apparently made it past air defences. Russia has continuously targeted port and grain storage facilities in Odesa since pulling out of a wartime deal that allowed Ukrainian grain exports to countries facing the threat of hunger. The attacks have destroyed silos, warehouses, oil terminals and other infrastructure critical for storage and shipping.

Meanwhile, six people have been killed in Kherson after Russia targeted ""residential quarters"" of the region, its governor Oleksandr Produkin has said. He added that ten others were injured in the strikes, which also hit a pharmacy, a market and a number of educational institutions.

Jade O'Brien was jailed for four months, banned from owning dogs for five years and XL Bully dog Narla will be destroyed after the two attacks in the Stockport area

An XL Bully dog viciously mauled a mum who was walking with her two children before going on to kill another dog, in a series of horrifying attacks just two weeks apart.

Jade O'Brien, who was looking after Narla, an XL Bully for her ex-partner at the time, then verbally abused the owner of the dog that had died, telling him ""It's not my f***ing fault."" She was jailed for four months as a result of both the incidents, which happened near the home they shared in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport.

Manchester Magistrates' Court heard how a woman was walking her one-year-old spaniel with her two children in July 2021 when she spotted a large grey dog running down O'Brien's driveway. The woman was so worried she grabbed her spaniel - but the dog then attacked her instead.

Nick Smart, prosecuting, said the animal ""began jumping up in an attempt to get to the dog she was carrying in her arms"". The woman was backed into a hedge and shouted for help and was bitten on the forearm. She eventually managed to get Narla off her but was left with serious injuries to her arms and legs, with scars that were ""still visible six months later"".

In the second attack, two weeks later, a teenage girl was walking her small, white dog near O'Brien's home when it was set upon and attacked by the XL bully. The teenager was so scared, the court heard, that she ""ran off believing the dog was going to attack her"". The white dog was badly injured with flesh ripped from its hind leg.

It was rushed to the vets but could not be saved. When her dad told O'Brien what had happened and that Narla was to blame she told him: ""It's not my f****** fault. F*** off d***head.""

In a victim impact statement, the man said the loss of his family's dog had left his daughter ""traumatised"" and she had suffered sleep problems and ""night tremors"" as a result. The court heard that O'Brien has eight previous convictions for battery, excess alcohol and criminal damage.

She was also banned from keeping dogs for three years in March after she failed to get treatment for her puppy's wounds leaving it in agony. The six-month-old XL bully-type breed called Babyface developed infected stitch wounds after undergoing an ear cropping procedure, which is illegal in the UK.

O'Brien, of Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, had previously pleaded guilty to two charges of being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control and one charge of using threatening/abusive/insulting words or behaviour.

Jonathan Condor, defending, told the court that Narla wasn't her dog and its owner, O'Brien's ex partner, was currently on remand in prison. He said O'Brien accepted she was responsible for the two attacks. He described O'Brien as a ""dog lover"" who had been left ""shocked"" by the attack on the girl's dog, saying she ""strongly opposed"" Narla's destruction.

District judge Thomas Mitchell said he had considered O'Brien's circumstances and that she had ""to some extent been imposed upon"" by her ex and wasn't the ""best person"" to look after dogs. O'Brien was jailed for four months, banned from owning dogs for five years and handed a £154 victim surcharge. A destruction order was made for Narla.

Danger Dogs - our demands

The Mirror is calling for these changes:

1. The overhaul of the Dangerous Dogs Act . An urgent review of the law is needed and tougher penalties should be considered.

2. Enforce the rules to stop the illegal and irresponsible breeding and selling of dogs.

3. A public information campaign to promote the importance of responsible dog ownership and the need for training.

Didier Drogba became one of Chelsea's most influential players during Jose Mourinho's time at Stamford Bridge, but the former Blues chief ignored him after his exit from Tottenham

Jose Mourinho and Didier Drogba were an integral part of the Chelsea team that reigned supreme in the Premier League during the former's maiden Stamford Bridge reign.

Mourinho was the coach coveted above all others and would go on to manage the likes of Manchester United and Real Madrid. Drogba was the imperious striker who spearheaded the Blues to numerous accolades and trophies during Mourinho's premiership.

The duo's careers have followed very different paths since Mourinho parted ways with Chelsea, but they seemingly remained in touch. But that didn't prevent Mourinho from ignoring his former star striker following his ill-fated stint in charge of Tottenham.

Mourinho spent 17 months at the helm of Chelsea's London rivals with the remit of turning the team into genuine title contenders and ending the club's long wait for silverware. But after overseeing matches behind closed doors through the Covid-19 pandemic, Mourinho was sacked by Daniel Levy following a chastening run.

At the time of his departure, Spurs were seventh in the Premier League and just days away from competing in the Carabao Cup final against Manchester City.

Mourinho responded to his exit by sharing a video on his Instagram account, which was commented on by Drogba. The Ivory Coast star replied: ""Enjoy your life ze. Enjoy it,"" along with a number of laughing emojis, but got no response.

Join the debate! What are your best memories of Mourinho at Chelsea? Let us know here.

Did Mourino follow his advice? Well, you be the judge. The Portuguese coach undertook a new role with Italian outfit AS Roma shortly after leaving the Premier League and it remains to be seen whether the former FC Porto chief will return to these shores.

That hasn't quelled speculation, though, with his name cropping up earlier this year when Chelsea were (again) on the lookout for a new head coach. It certainly seems far more likely that there could be further chapters in the story between Mourinho and Chelsea rather than Tottenham, who have turned away from hiring elite coaches after being burned by Mourinho and then Antonio Conte.

It was even claimed back in January that Mourinho was eager to return to the Premier League after growing disillusioned with life in Rome. And while it remains to be seen if a return to England will materialise, his reign in Italy appears to be reaching its conclusion.

He is currently under pressure after enduring a difficult start to the campaign. That has left him frustrated, though, given he rejected the overtures of the Saudi Pro League during the summer.

Speaking last month, he said: ""Three months ago the idea of me leaving was seen almost as a tragedy. During the holidays, I received the biggest and craziest offer a coach has ever received in the history of football.

""And I turned it down. I did so because I'd given my word to my players, I'd given my word to the fans and I'd given my word to the club owner. Three months later, it seems like I'm the problem. I can't accept that.""

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have to face the music if they do attend King Charles' Coronation - as they could bump into a lot of people they have thrown allegations at

If Prince Harry and Meghan Markle do attend the Coronation of King Charles III, they could face a large number of awkward confrontations.

The question on everyone's lips is whether the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will fly over from California for the momentous occasion.

The couple have confirmed they have been invited as part of the 2,000-strong congregation at Westminster Abbey - but they have not revealed if they will be part of the celebrations.

There are a number of key issues, with relations between Harry and his family at an all time low, and the historic event awkwardly takes place on Archie's birthday.

If they do decide to go, they will have to face the music and could bump into a lot of people they have thrown allegations at.

Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh

One of the most awkward interactions that the Coronation will throw up is between Meghan and Sophie, the new Duchess of Edinburgh.

Sophie, the former Countess of Wessex, was duty-bound to curtsy to the Duchess of Sussex due to Meghan being of higher rank, but now this is not the case after receiving her new title.

A friend of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh told Daily Mail: ""Sophie is relieved. She no longer has to curtsy to someone in the family who has not only left Royal duties but has spent the past three years criticising the institution that Sophie works so hard to support.""

The late Queen Elizabeth II actually wanted Prince Edward and daughter-in-law Sophie to become mentors to Harry and Meghan when the former Suits actress joined the Royal Family.

According to a book, Meghan ""made it clear"" she didn't need Sophie's help and would instead rely on her new husband.

But author and friend of the royals Gyles Brandreth in his book, Elizabeth: An Intimate Portrait, he writes: ""The Queen (who, of course, had seen it all before) understood that Harry's girl might find adjusting to Royal life 'challenging to begin with' (as she put it). 'It is very jolty, but you soon get used to it' - that was Her Majesty's experience going back many years.

""To help Meghan, the Queen suggested that her daughter-in-law, Sophie Wessex, would be an ideal mentor. 'Sophie can help show you the ropes,' said the Queen.

""Meghan made it clear that she did not feel she needed Sophie's help. She had Harry.""

The public

Once loved by almost everyone, the Sussexes have slumped in popularity in recent years.

And it's been particularly bad in the last few months since the release of Spare and the Netflix series.

Harry had a net positive rating of 51 percent before Megxit, which then fell to 20 percent immediately after and further still after the Oprah Winfrey interview.

Meghan's popularity has taken a similar hit, going from a net positivity of 20 percent in November 2019 to -11 in January 2020 and now stands at -46.

Most recently, the couple had a serious fall in popularity in the US, taking them lower than disgraced royal Prince Andrew.

According to a poll conducted by Redfield & Wilton for Newsweek on February 19, Harry was disliked by 42% of Americans, compared to 32% who said they liked him ""” with a 'net approval rating of -10.

The same poll saw Harry at 38 points in a December 5 poll showing a staggering 48 point drop in.

In December, the pair were confronted by a heckler as they arrived at a New York awards show who shouted: ""What do you think about destroying the Royal Family?""

There could be more hecklers on the streets during the Coronation.

Queen Camilla

Harry has blasted a lot of the royals - but some of his strongest criticism has come against Queen Camilla.

Sources said the King was outraged by a string of Harry's accusations in his controversial memoir, in particular his attacks on his wife.

There were more than 60 mentions of Camilla in Spare - and the Duke of Sussex does not hold back his dislike for 'the Other Woman'.

Harry once pondered if she would become his ""wicked stepmother"" and says she would throw people under the bus to sit on the throne - and even turned his bedroom into her dressing room.

He claimed he and William begged Charles not to marry Camilla but they said they would welcome her into the family, and eventually only wanted her to be happy so she could be less ""dangerous"".

In a TV interview, Harry added: ""She was the villain. She was the third person in their marriage. She needed to rehabilitate her image.""

Charles was said to be furious at how his son has spoken about his wife - saying it ""crossed the line"".

Harry having to meet Camilla would be a very awkward moment at the Coronation.

The Bee, The Fly and The Wasp

No they're not a new set of spandex-wearing superheroes, but according to Prince Harry they are a trio of advisors who wield incredible power and each considered themselves to be 'The One True Monarch'.

Harry blasted the trio in Spare, who are believed to be the private secretaries of the senior royals at the time, in Spare.

Harry says they sorted the advisors into zoological categories, with The Bee being codename for the late Queen's private secretary, Sir Edward Young, according to The Times.

The Wasp is believed to be King Charles' private secretary, Clive Alderton, while The Fly is reportedly Prince William's, Simon Case.

In the book, Harry explains that he spent his life dealing with courtiers but now it is mostly just three ""middle-aged white men"" who had consolidated power ""through a series of bold Machiavellian manoeuvres"".

Describing them as ""usurpers"", Harry adds: ""Deep down, I feared that each man felt himself to be the One True Monarch, that each was taking advantage of a Queen in her nineties, enjoying his influential position while merely appearing to serve.""

There might be an awkward reunion with the trio.

King Charles

Perhaps the biggest tension rests between Harry and his father after the family's dirty laundry was aired in his autobiographical memoir Spare and in his Netflix docu-series with Meghan.

He alleged Charles and William were conspiring against him and revealed private conversations from Prince Philip's funeral.

King Charles obviously crops up a lot in the book, with Harry writing about the night his father told him that his mother had died and how he did not hug him.

Charles is said to have told his sons not to make his final years a misery and made a joke to Diana after Harry was born - saying his work was done now he had an heir and a spare.

The King also reportedly jokingly questioned whether he was Harry's father and made a joke in 'poor taste' about rumours James Hewitt is his real dad.

More recently, Harry has accused his father of being cold, revealing his parenting technique is to 'smother' his kids with 'love and affection', and claimed he ""doesn't speak the same language"" as the rest of his family.

And their relationship has become strained even further as Charles decided to kick Harry and Meghan out of Frogmore Cottage - the home which was gifted to them by the late Queen Elizabeth II.

According to Omid Scobie, one of the authors behind the biography of Harry and Meghan, Finding Freedom, the couple was told the property was needed for ""someone else"" and that relations between the Sussexes and the rest of the Firm was at ""an all-time low"".

Scobie also said that Harry and Meghan were left ""stunned"" by the movie, while two other royals have also been left ""appalled"".

Royal sources have claimed Charles took decisive action immediately after being passed a dossier of findings by aides revealing details from Harry's explosive book.

An insider said: ""It was the last straw. Harry was well aware how Camilla would be a red line for his father and he crossed with flagrant disregard anyway. The King felt without a doubt it crossed a line - it was the ultimate act of disrespect.""

Harry reportedly wants a showdown meeting with Charles before the Coronation, but will it happen?

Prince Andrew

Harry and Meghan might be spending a lot of time with his disgraced uncle - as all three will reportedly not be allowed on the balcony if they attend.

But the outcasts might not be very chummy, as the Duke of Sussex commented about the Duke of York come when discussing his own security arrangements.

In 2021, Andrew paid millions to settle a US civil case brought by his accuser Virginia Giuffre.

The Duke of York stepped down from public duties following the fallout from his disastrous BBC interview with Emily Maitlis, where he was questioned about his friendship with paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.

He has always denied any allegations and has said he had no recollection of ever meeting Giuffre.

In Spare, Harry writes about his uncle: ""He was embroiled in a shameful scandal, accused of the sexual assault of a young woman, and no one had so much as suggested that he lose his security.

""Whatever grievances people had against us, sex crimes weren't on the list.""

Harry also awkwardly said Meghan believed Andrew was the late Queen's personal assistant during their first meeting because he was carrying her handbag.

So things might be a tad tense with Andrew if they do attend the Coronation.

Prince William

The demise of the relationship between William and Harry has been sad to witness - and it doesn't look like they will make up any time soon.

Referred to as 'Willy' in Spare, Harry accused his brother of plotting with their father and revealed details of that sensational reported fight.

William allegedly pushed him to the floor during a row at his Kensington Palace home, leaving him with a ripped necklace and bruises.

Harry said William and Kate encouraged him to wear a Nazi costume to a fancy dress party, which sparked outrage in 2005.

The Duke discussed being told by William to pretend he didn't know him at Eton and his brother's 'alarming' thinning hair.

Harry reportedly wants to speak to his brother before confirming whether he will attend the Coronation.

Princess Kate

Harry and Meghan seemed destined to have a strong relationship with Kate when they formed the Fab Four.

But relations started to sour and Harry detailed a number of rows between Meghan and the Princess of Wales.

Meghan upset Kate after she had given birth in 2018 by saying she must have 'baby brain' because of her hormones.

Harry claimed Kate admitted she made Meghan cry during a row over bridesmaids dresses before her wedding - and Charlotte burst into tears.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were also jealous of the furnishing William and Kate had in their home and had to make do with shopping at IKEA.

They was very little interaction with Kate at the late Queen's funeral - and the same would be expected at the Coronation.

Two men detained in Saffron Walden, Essex, have become the first to be prevented from owning dogs under a new law. The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act stopped David Hilden, 39, and Tyron Young, 35 from owning dogs for the next three years

Two men have become the first people in the UK to be banned from owning dogs under a law.

New laws designed to target poachers have prevented David Hilden, 39, and Tyron Young, 35 from owning animals.

It is the first time anyone has been slapped with disqualification orders under section 66 of the new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022. It means neither of them can own a dog for the next three years.

The pair were detained by police while they were walking across crop yield in Saffron Walden, Essex.

Hilden of Croydon, southeast London admitted to police that he went on to the land to pursue rabbits. Young, from Morden in south London claimed to be just walking his dog at the time.

They were found in the field with four dogs - including two lurchers on slip leads.

Admitting to daytime trespass in pursuit of game, they were given the punishment at Colchester Magistrates Court, Essex on Tuesday.

A further charge of £120 was given to Hilden and he also had to pay court costs of £105 and a victim surcharge amounting to £48.

Young was also slapped with £105 in court costs, but his fine was extended to £200 and he received an £80 surcharge.

Investigating officer PC Nigel Wright, of Essex Police, said: ""The poaching of wild animals is extremely cruel but it can also cause a lot of damage to crops and farmland, which is very costly for the land owner or farmer.

""Dogs are integral to poaching and I am delighted that the magistrates were able to use this new legislation to deprive these two poachers of any access to dogs, even just walking someone else's, for the next three years.

""We look forward to working with the CPS to have these disqualification orders applied in cases of hare coursing and other poaching offences in the future.""

Sally Robinson, District Crown Prosecutor for CPS East of England and CPS Hare Coursing Lead, added: ""This type of offending has a profound impact on rural and farming communities, which is why I am thrilled that, in a legal first, we successfully asked the court to apply disqualification orders in this case.

""I hope this sends a warning to anyone who thinks about poaching any form of wildlife, that we will not hesitate to ask for these orders whenever possible.

""We will continue to clamp down on poachers - working closely with the police and other partner agencies - using all the powers at our disposal.""

John Fewtrell managed to snag a cucumber in his weekly Tesco order despite ongoing fruit and vegetable shortages affected the salad staple, but the Brit was left livid when it finally arrived

A miffed Tesco shopper managed to snag a cucumber despite shortages but was left reeling when it finally arrived.

Despite ongoing issues over fruit and vegetable shortages affecting the UK, John Fewtrell managed to buy the salad staple as apart of his weekly shop from Tesco.

But when the 75p veg finally arrived, John was left furious by what he had been given.

Instead of ready to eat in his favourite sandwich or salad, John's cucumber was misshapen and had peeling skin.

The dented veg wasn't what he had ordered and it comes as Tesco, along with other supermarkets, recently rationed how many cucumbers customers could get their hands on.

But as John, from Wilstead, Bedfordshire, complained to the supermarket giant, other shoppers argued he had gotten lucky being able to land the veg at all amid current shortages.

Nat Martinez said: ""Think yourself lucky you got one at all with the mass shortages. I went to four supermarkets for a pepper and cucumber and none to be found.""

Charley Cobbs added: ""Given the cucumber shortage, be grateful you got one.""

But others were more sympathetic to his plight. Gemma Slinger said: ""Looks like it needs a warm tank and feeding.""

Tate Read added: ""Looks like it has been kicked and picked back up.""

The shortages of cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers and other vegetables was partly driven by poor weather in southern Spain and north Africa.

At this time of the year, the UK relies on imports for a lot of its veg - and from these two regions especially.

However, the weather impacted harvests and left supermarkets shelves running low.

This was exacerbated by farmers in the UK choosing to leave greenhouses empty this winter as fuel costs skyrocketed, making it too costly for some to grow their veg.

But Brits were recently warned that such shortages could only be the ""tip of the iceberg"".

Tom Bradshaw, deputy president of the Farmers' Union said that a reliance on imports had left the UK more vulnerable than ever to shock weather events.

Speaking to Times Radio he said the UK was at a ""tipping point"" and needed to take ""command of the food we produce"".

He said: ""We've been warning about this moment for the past year. The tragic events in Ukraine have driven inflation, particularly energy inflation to levels that we haven't seen before.

""There's a lack of confidence from the growers that they're going to get the returns that justify planting their glasshouses, and at the moment we've got a lot of glasshouses that would be growing the tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, aubergine that are sitting there empty because they simply couldn't take the risk to plant them with the crops, not thinking they'd get the returns from the marketplace.

""And with them being completely reliant on imports - we'd always have some imports - but we've been completely reliant on imports (now).

""And when there's been some shock weather events in Morocco and Spain, it's meant that we've had these shortages.

""It's really interesting that before Brexit we didn't used to source anything, or very little, from Morocco but we've been forced to go further afield and now these climatic shocks becoming more prevalent have had a real impact on the food available on our shelves today.""

Puppies struggling to breathe or sleep due to painful health issues are being bred in squalid conditions or even vehicles, investigations have shown

An explosion in unlicensed ""backyard breeders"" putting profits over puppy welfare is fuelling a spike in serious and fatal dog attacks, a Mirror investigation has learned.

Puppies struggling to breathe or sleep due to painful health issues are being bred in squalid conditions or even vehicles, experts say.

But even more disturbing is a trend of gangsters breeding dogs to cash in on the cruel trade and evade the law.

Dog breeding pens are available online for £200, while experts say one litter can rake in more than £10,000.

A dog pregnancy can last 57 to 70 days, meaning that in one year a ­backyard breeder with just one bitch can feasibly make £50,000 to £60,000.

Dog trainer Kate Golding, of Scawby, Lincs, said: ""Dogs can sell for a lot of money - fashionable Frenchies, American Bullys and Bulldogs can make tens of thousands if not more per litter.

""It's easy money, particularly if you're not investing in their environment or how they're brought up and you're happy to sell to the highest bidder.""

Sting operations by local authorities and welfare agencies have exposed the abhorrent conditions of puppy mills and backyard breeders. Multiple dogs are often crammed into tiny cages, kept in small bedrooms using a baby gate, or even loaded into the back of vans.

They are regularly deprived of proper nutrition, sunlight, social skills or even forced to live among their excrement.

One image shows a backyard breeder using corrugated iron tied together to separate a small corner of their yard. Neighbours claimed they were keeping Jack Russell dogs in the ""barren"" space.

""A reputable breeder will be health testing dogs to the nth degree. There are loads of inheritable diseases that can be screened for, in the backyard dogs that doesn't happen,"" Kate added.

Earlier this week the Mirror saw a clip of a pack of dogs mauling a six-year-old girl as she played in the street.

Neighbours in Trafford, Manchester had raised concerns about someone allegedly breeding dogs and keeping more than a dozen in a caravan.

Police have seized 17 dogs and charged a 35-year-old man with eight counts of being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control that caused injury.

The charges are in ­relation to the girl and on a separate occasion to a man in December 2022.

Since last March, 11 people, including five children aged four or younger, have been killed by dogs in Britain. Last year was the ­deadliest on record for dog attacks in more than 30 years and experts say attacks have tripled since 2000.

They believe there is ""a direct link"" between the rising number of fatal and serious dog attacks and poor breeding.

""They are so poorly bred they are often in pain. There is a link between behaviour and pain,"" said Vanessa Waddon, of animal charity Hope Rescue, near Cardiff, South Wales. Seven of the last 11 fatal attacks in the UK involved a Bull breed.

The Mirror has also heard reports of rescued XL Bully dogs needing two or three handlers to control them.

Organised crime groups have been linked to backyard breeding to create status pets, launder drug money or simply turn a quick buck.

Vanessa explained: ""There is a very clear link between people who have convictions for drug dealing and illegal puppy farming. We got a load of English and French bulldogs from a police raid where they found drugs, weapons, cash. It is an easy way to launder money, the consequences are not nearly as severe as drug dealing.""

This year, convicted drug gang boss Thomas Raymont was exposed as running a bulldog breeding business from prison. Raymont, of Warrington, Cheshire was jailed in 2021 for his part in a cocaine and heroin supply worth more than £100,000.

When sentenced at Liverpool crown court, Raymont claimed his illegal drug money came from his dog breeding business. But in January an undercover journalist found Raymont was still running the UK arm of Muscletone Bullys from his cell. Popular Frenchies, Pugs, Bulldogs and Bullys fall into flat-faced breeds.

But animal behaviourist Hannah Molloy warns the animals are ""struggling to breathe and sleep"". She said: ""Dogs are being bred with what we call ""˜extreme conformation' so there are breeds like French bulldogs and pugs living with painful conditions.""

This extreme breeding combined with cruel procedures like ear cropping can make the dogs agitated by the pain. ""Ear cropping is illegal but it is not illegal to import a dog with ears cropped. So lots of breeders pretend they have imported them,"" said Vanessa. ""They've bad spines, they are trying to get as much muscle as possible on.""

Another fear is a trend towards co-owning dogs, where an investor houses a dog while the breeder puts it out to stud, and they split the profits.

Trainer Kate Golding said: ""There's a ­disregard for personality traits of the parents. We hear ""˜the mum growled at us and the dad was the same, we couldn't go anywhere near him'."" The National Police Chief Council said it is working across the country through its Dangerous Dogs Working Group.

Forces such as North Wales and Sutton Police in London have introduced early intervention systems to warn owners of dangerous behaviour.

But experts say the law needs to be overhauled and properly reinforced.

Conor McGregor is currently filming the UFC's latest series of The Ultimate Fighter alongside rival Michael Chandler, and the pair clashed as tensions rose

Conor McGregor has suggested his issue with Michael Chandler has now been resolved ahead of their UFC meeting.

McGregor has been out of action for almost two years after breaking his leg, but recently announced his long-awaited return to the octagon will take place against Chandler later this year. His comeback outing is part of the UFC's latest instalment of The Ultimate Fighter series, with McGregor and Chandler currently filming in Las Vegas for the coaching stint of the event.

With both men competing against each other to win the competition, tensions threatened to spill over while on set as the pair were involved in a number of spats over their differences. However McGregor has now insisted the tense moments were natural in rivalry and confirmed he still has respect for his upcoming opponent.

""I had respect for (Michael) Chandler [before TUF 31] - we had an issue, right,"" McGregor told Barstool Sports when explaining his recent reported altercation with Chandler. ""Obviously, tempers are flaring - it's a f***ing hostile thing. I like his style, he likes my style, we have a good little buzz.

""There's still competitive fire - I'm still gonna mince him. I know he's gonna try and throw everything into his shots also. But there's still admiration - that's how it should be. That's how sport should be, you should have the ability to separate it. We had an issue once during it, and it's all good. Tempers were flaring - we got past it.""

Chandler will be looking to rain on his rival's parade with fans likely to lap up the UFC's biggest star's comeback fight despite his recent form. McGregor is looking to make a successful comeback to the octagon to halt his slump of just one win in his last four fights which included two defeats by Dustin Poirier.

Equally, Chandler lost to 'The Diamond' last time out and he will to regain momentum in his push for a title charge. With new differences cropping up between the pair, Chandler has since claimed he no longer likes McGregor despite admitting previous fondness.

""I'm a pretty nice even keel guy but I don't really like Conor McGregor that much,"" he said after filming. ""I've got a ton of respect for him, but he and I don't see eye-to-eye in a lot of ways. That's a lot of competitive chirp. Even in his awesome trash talk, he's got a lot of respect for the purity of MMA.

""We have a lot of mutual respect for one and other, but I don't know if we like each other as much we thought we were going to. The good thing is we get to settle it with 4oz gloves.""

The third instalment of the landmark series took 1,904 days to film in 43 countries across six continents, but it opens closer to home with Sir David Attenborough in Kent

Planet Earth returns to our screens this month as Sir David Attenborough once again reveals the wonders and dangers of life on our fragile planet.

The highly anticipated third instalment of the BBC franchise opens with Sir David, 97, walking through the same meadow in Kent where Charles Darwin observed the natural world 200 years ago and created his theory of evolution. Sir David says: ""The natural world continues to surprise us but since Darwin's time, it has changed beyond recognition, being transformed by a powerful force - us.

""We will see how animals are adapting in extraordinary ways to survive the new challenges they face. ""We must now look at the world through a new lens."" Executive producer Mike Gunton, who has worked with Sir David for more than 30 years, says the broadcasting veteran still has a huge influence on the way the show is made, even though he is not able to go out on location as often as he used to.

Mike says: ""You can't make the series without him. His voice is in my head in every conversation we ever have about this. I think, ""˜How would he tell it? How would he say it?' ""We are the producers, but it's the DNA that comes from him."" Here, we take a look at some of the natural phenomena that will be going under the microscope in the eight-part series, from the remotest jungles to the deepest oceans.

Animals brutal fight for survival

The landmark series is renowned for being visually spectacular, and this season certainly does not disappoint. One extraordinary scene which took four years to film shows a bloodbath off the Robberg Peninsula in South Africa.

A seal pup glides through the Indian Ocean as a great white shark cuts through the water. The seal narrowly escapes but a hunting frenzy ensues and the world's greatest predator leaves a cloud of blood in its wake. But incredibly, the cape fur seals fight back, slowly building in confidence and numbers to drive the shark back. And in a scene that wouldn't look out of place in a horror movie, a translucent sea angel, found in the depths of the White Sea in Russia, traps a sea butterfly with tentacles from its head before eating it alive.

The crew also captured the fascinating archer fish in the coral reefs of Raja Ampat, Indonesia, for the first time. It fires jets of water from its mouth like arrows to shoot down insects in the plants above the surface. When blasted by the powerful streams, the bugs are sent flying in all directions.

Cameraman Mitch Buckley says: ""The most unexpected challenge was the trigger-happy habits of these fish. ""A hopeful archer fish will fire at anything just to see if they can knock it down. They got me in my ear and, on more than one occasion, my eye.""

New tech and fearless crews

The series took 1,904 days to film in 43 countries across six continents. Cutting-edge technology, such as lightweight drones, high-speed cameras and remotely operated deep-sea submersibles were used to create the show. Filming during the pandemic also forced Planet Earth's team to come up with new ways of working.

Almost a third of the shoots were managed remotely and filmmakers from 27 countries were hired to help capture the magic. And it took more than a year of consultation with scientists to develop a camera that could be attached to southern right whales in Argentina to achieve the show's stunning footage.

Producer Nick Easton reveals: ""We used food-grade silicone suckers, essentially, but they had a little tube running off them clumped with cornstarch that dissolves in salt water after 20 minutes."" Viewers can also hear sounds normally undetectable to humans thanks to special contact microphones, which reproduce the sound of treehoppers summoning bees to defend them from ""assassin bugs"".

But it isn't just technology which produces the show's iconic moments - the crew themselves take on intense challenges. Assistant producer Georgie Ward waded through crocodile infested lagoons to capture flamingos in Mexico, and lived in a Vietnamese cave for three weeks to document how life can exist without light.

""It was a huge undertaking,"" she says. ""My sense of time was completely gone. ""Coming out and hearing birds in the jungle and seeing colours""¦ it felt like everything was in 3D.

Inventive creatures

Among the animals shown to be thriving in the show are ""mafia macaques"" in Bali, Indonesia. They got their name after learning how to steal items from tourists they can trade back for food. Executive producer Mike Gunton says: ""They know the most valuable things they can steal are worth more, so they deliberately pick iPhones because people will give anything for their phone back.""

The team also found chimpanzees living in a Ugandan forest that has been overrun by farmland. They were struggling to find enough food so they learned to cross the road and go into the farms, where the crops grow.

Mike adds: ""The relationship between the farmers and the chimps is evolving because actually the farmers think, ""˜OK, we're going to have to put up with this'.""

Human intervention can be a good thing

In Planet Earth III, a conservation group can be seen stepping in to help green turtles which come ashore on Raine Island in Queensland, Australia, to nest. Because of rising sea levels, the largest rookery on the tiny island will disappear beneath the waves in the not-so-distant future. To illustrate the change, Planet Earth III shows a 31-year-old Sir David on one of the first visits to the island in 1957.

Today, the temperature of the sand is at a record high, meaning most of the turtles born are female. BAFTA-winning series producer Matt Brandon says: ""One of the golden rules of wildlife filmmaking is that when you're witnessing a natural event, you try not to get involved. ""But many of the things our crews are witnessing around the world are no longer natural. ""They found numerous turtles trapped in nets and there was no way those turtles could survive so they did cut them free.""

One of the final episodes in the series also shows how two animal-loving women in Austria dress up in yellow as foster mothers to rear ibis birds, which were extinct in Europe until about 400 years ago. Matt adds: ""Bald ibis can't survive unless they migrate so the most extraordinary thing these women do is to teach them to fly in nail-biting fashion by going up in microlights. It's pretty exceptional.""

Harsh reality of modern life

In the two decades since Planet Earth was first filmed, the team have seen the world battered by climate change and animals struggling to survive. Executive producer Mike Gunton says: ""I think audiences now, more than ever, want to know the truth. ""We hold a great responsibility, as filmmakers, to create that spark of passion for our natural world.""

The show tackles the impact of the climate crisis head-on and looks at some of the planet's winners and losers. The world's rarest freshwater dolphin is among the losers featured. The animals live cheek by jowl with people but when the dams shut in the Sukkur area of Pakistan, they get stuck on the wrong side of the river.

Producer Nick Easton says: ""We feature a special dolphin ambulance and it's a very risky operation. ""The dolphin may well die, but it faces certain death in the irrigation canal. ""That's the sad reality. Dolphins are thriving in that area, but without our help they're not going to thrive much longer.""

Joe Thompson had been a classic yo-yo dieter for most of his life but when he was too big to be able to do up his seatbelt on a rollercoaster and told to get off he knew he had to do something - now the 35-year-old has been named Slimming World's Mr Sleek

A former yo-yo dieter who was once too big to ride a rollercoaster has finally lost weight for good after joining his local Slimming World group.

Joe Thompson is now 5st 3.5lbs lighter and has been named Slimming World's Mr Sleek 2023.

The 35-year-old from Essex said: ""I'd struggled with my weight for most of my life. I was adopted at birth, so I found it hard looking different to the rest of my family - I convinced myself that I had the ""˜fat gene'.

""Leaving home for university meant I was away from my mum's healthy cooking, relying heavily on takeaways and drinking more than I ever had before. During this time, I was also figuring out my sexuality and realised I wasn't straight. I struggled to come to terms with this and sought comfort in food.

""I had many embarrassing moments over the years - one that sticks in my head was an incident at Thorpe Park where I couldn't fasten the safety harness on the Colossus ride. I had to get off and walk past a queue of people, who I'm sure all knew exactly why I couldn't ride. I tried to brush it off, but inside I was completely mortified.""

Joe, who lives in Buckhurst Hill with his husband Gareth, continues: ""I also suffered from chronic podagra. I'd have a flare-up every four to six weeks - during which time I'd be in a

lot of pain and sometimes unable to walk for a couple of days. Gareth also used to complain about my very loud snoring, which must have been linked to my weight because he doesn't mention it anymore!""

Although Joe was worried about his weight and wanted to change, he found himself trapped in a cycle of yo-yo dieting.

He said: ""For about two years I cut out all carbohydrates and while I did lose a lot of weight I found it really restrictive, and I was miserable.

""I also put all of the weight back on when I started eating normally again. I felt like I was always on or off a diet, and I'd never found a way to lose weight sensibly and sustainably. I was a classic yo-yo dieter.""

Joe's turning point came when he saw photographs of himself after attending a number of back-to-back weddings.

He said: ""I really hated having photographs taken by other people. I'd become quite good at angling the camera so I looked slimmer or cropping out my body so you wouldn't notice my weight as much.

""I even used apps to edit my photographs to appear slimmer. So, when the photos came back from my friends' weddings, I was shocked. I couldn't believe it was me in the pictures and I just felt terrible. I think I'd become so used to editing my photographs that it really hit home to see the ""˜real' me.""

Joe had heard a lot about Slimming World but was sceptical about the plan, especially given that it was a lot more flexible than methods he had tried in the past.

He said: ""I joined my local Slimming World group just a few days after I'd seen those photographs from the weddings. I have to say when I learned about the eating plan I was pretty cynical - I couldn't see how I'd be able to lose weight without cutting carbs or counting calories.

I decided the only way to find out was to put my faith in the plan and I was soon eating my words - I lost 11½lbs in my first week! From that day forward I haven't had any more reservations, and I'm living proof the plan works.""

With Slimming World's Food Optimising eating plan, members can choose freely from more than 350 healthy foods, including lean meat and poultry, eggs, fat-free dairy, pasta, rice, grains, fruit and veg - without weighing, counting or measuring. By satisfying their appetite

with this Free Food, which forms the basis of hundreds of everyday meals, slimmers can reduce calories without counting them, lose weight without feeling hungry, personalise the plan to their dietary requirements and enjoy the foods they love.

Weighing almost 20 stone, Joe felt nervous about joining his local Slimming World group, though soon realised he had nothing to fear.

He said: ""I texted my Slimming World Consultant Lorna in advance and she was so lovely, so that made me feel better. After a few weeks I really threw myself into the group setting and soon found the support of my fellow members to be fundamental to my success. It was like nothing I'd ever experienced before.

I wasn't alone anymore and that was such a wonderful feeling. I'm now help out each week at group and have made some lifelong friends.

""I love that the plan allows me to eat to satisfy my appetite. I had tried calorie counting before, so being able to lose weight without measuring and weighing everything is so freeing.

Before, I'd panic about ""˜running out' of calories and ending up hungry. With Slimming World that never happens because there's always something substantial to eat when you are hungry. It was totally revolutionary for me.""

As Joe began to lose weight, he found that his mobility and energy levels increased, which encouraged him to start thinking about getting more active.

He said: ""I used to be quite sporty as a kid, but my podagra meant that I'd become really sedentary over the years. As my symptoms started to ease and the flare ups became less frequent, I started to do more exercise.

""I love walking - I find it's as good for your mental wellbeing as it is fo your physical health.""

Joe soon got on board with Slimming World's Body Magic physical activity support programme.

He said: ""I loved that it gave you a framework to build up your activity levels gradually and there wasn't any pressure. As I became fitter I started walking with a 30kg weighted vest. It's amazing to think I used to carry extra weight around like that every day!""

Now that he's transformed his own health, Joe's next mission is to inspire other people to follow in his footsteps by sharing his journey on social media.

He said: ""I love when someone tells me that they have joined Slimming World because they have been inspired by my success. I wish I could tell everyone that losing weight doesn't have to be miserable and boring - and that by joining a group you'll always have the support you need to achieve your goals. I'm done with the yo-yo diets because I've finally found a way to live healthily, for the long term.""

582,"Man cries out in agony as he is NAILED to cross in real crucifixion on Good Friday","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/man-cries-out-agony-nailed-29653293","Man cries out in agony as he is NAILED to cross in real crucifixion on Good Friday

The real-life crucifixions in the farming village of San Pedro Cutud in Pampanga province north of Manila resumed after a three-year pause due to the coronavirus pandemic

Eight people were nailed to crosses to reenact Jesus Christ's suffering in a gory Good Friday tradition that draws thousands of devotees and tourists to the Philippines despite being rejected by the Catholic church.

The real-life crucifixions in the farming village of San Pedro Cutud in Pampanga province north of Manila resumed after a three-year pause due to the coronavirus pandemic.

About a dozen villagers registered but only eight men participated, including 62-year-old sign painter Ruben Enaje, who was nailed to a wooden cross for the 34th time in San Pedro Cutud.

In a news conference shortly after his brief crucifixion, Enaje said he prayed for the eradication of the Covid-19 virus and the end of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has contributed to gas and food prices soaring worldwide.

""It's just these two countries involved in that war, Russia and Ukraine, but all of us are being affected,"" said Enaje, who appeared to be well and showed his two bandaged hands to journalists.

The father of four said he wanted to end his extraordinary penitence because of his age but would decide with finality before Lent next year.

While the pain from the nailing was not as intense as anticipated, he said he always felt edgy before each crucifixion.

""To be honest, I always feel nervous because I could end up dead on the cross,"" he said before Friday's nailing.

""When I'm laid down on the cross, my body begins to feel cold,"" he said. ""When my hands are tied, I just close my eyes and tell myself, 'I can do this. I can do this.""'

Surviving nearly unscathed when he fell from a three-story building in 1985 prompted Enaje to undergo the ordeal as thanksgiving for what he considered a miracle.

He extended the ritual after loved ones recovered from serious illnesses, one after another, turning him into a village celebrity as the ""Christ"" in the Lenten reenactment of the Way of the Cross.

Ahead of their crucifixion on a dusty hill, Enaje and the other devotees, wearing thorny crowns of twigs, carried heavy wooden crosses on their backs for more than a kilometre (more than half a mile) in the scorching heat.

Village actors dressed as Roman centurions later hammered 4ins (10cm) stainless steel nails through his palms and feet, then set him aloft on a cross under the sun for about 10 minutes

Other penitents walked barefoot through village streets and beat their bare backs with sharp bamboo sticks and pieces of wood

Some participants in the past opened cuts in the penitents' backs using broken glass to ensure the ritual was sufficiently bloody.

The gruesome spectacle reflects the Philippines' unique brand of Catholicism, which merges church traditions with folk superstitions.

Many of the mostly impoverished penitents undergo the ritual to atone for sins, pray for the sick or for a better life, and give thanks for miracles.

Church leaders in the Philippines have frowned on the crucifixions and self-flagellations, saying Filipinos can show their deep faith and religious devotion without hurting themselves and by doing charity work instead, such as donating blood.

Robert Reyes, a prominent Catholic priest and human rights activist in the country, said the bloody rites reflect the church's failure to fully educate many Filipinos on Christian tenets, leaving them on their own to explore personal ways of seeking divine help for all sorts of maladies.

Folk Catholicism has become deeply entrenched in the local religious culture, Reyes said, citing a chaotic procession of a black statue of Jesus Christ called the Black Nazarene each January, which authorities say draws more than a million devotees each year in one of Asia's largest religious festivals.

Many bring towels to be wiped on the wooden statue, believing it has powers to cure ailments and ensure good health and a better life.

""The question is, where were we church people when they started doing this?"" Reyes asked, saying the clergy should immerse itself in communities more and converse regularly with villagers.

""If we judge them, we'll just alienate them.""

The decades-long crucifixion tradition, meanwhile, has put impoverished San Pedro Cutud - one of the more than 500 villages in rice-growing Pampanga province - on the map.

Organisers said more than 15,000 foreign and Filipino tourists and devotees gathered for the cross nailings in Cutud and two other nearby villages.

There was a festive air as villagers peddled bottled water, hats, food and religious items, and police and marshals kept order.

""They like this because there is really nothing like this on earth,"" said Johnson Gareth, a British tour organiser, who brought 15 tourists from eight countries, including the United States, Canada and Germany, to witness the crucifixions.

""It's less gruesome than people think. They think it's going to be very macabre or very disgusting but it's not. It's done in a very respectful way.""

In the past, Gareth said tourists were ""genuinely inspired and I think they left with a newfound respect for people's beliefs"".

The shocking incident that left former Springbok star Lukas van Biljon and his father injured took place in the early hours on a farm at Oranjeville, Free State Province with police now hunting those involved

Former South African rugby star Lukas van Biljon was stabbed repeatedly in the chest and his father shot three times and left for dead when six men attacked their farm at midnight.

Springbok hooker Van Biljon, 47, was warned if he fought back his children, who were tied up, would be killed as the gang ransacked the farm at Oranjeville, Free State Province. The controversial player - who was dropped from the Boks after 13 caps in 2003 after yet another nightclub brawl - was stabbed several times as a ""strong warning to behave"".

Dad Andre, 70, had tried to make a desperate call to fellow farmers for help on a radio but was spotted and was shot three times in the chest and hand and is critical in hospital.

South African Police spokesman Captain Loraine Earle said two of the attackers were arrested after local farmers were alerted and put into place an action plan to block all roads.

She said: ""Just after midnight on Saturday the police were called to a robbery at a smallholding at Oranjeville belonging to the Van Biljon family where two men were injured.

""It is alleged six armed men entered the house and tied the children with cable ties and a 47-year-old man was stabbed and his 70-year-old father shot during the robbery.""

A farmer who knows the Van Biljon family well said: ""Lukas is a big strong boy but he could do nothing as it was made clear his children would be shot if he put up a fight.

""He was still stabbed several times but it is father Andre who is the worry as he is in intensive care in a very bad way from gunshots.""

The two arrested suspects are due at the Heilbron Magistrate's Court today (Monday) on charges of house robbery and attempted murder while the other four are still being hunted.

The former Sharks hooker played 13 times for the Boks between 2001 and 2003 with his first game vs Italy and his last vs New Zealand.

Amanda Owen, who rose to fame starring on her farming reality show Our Yorkshire Farm, debuted her glam new look on ITV's Lorraine today as she opens up about co-parenting with her estranged husband Clive

Amanda Owen debuted her glam new look on Lorraine today, as she opened up about co-parenting with Clive.

The Our Yorkshire Farm star appeared on the ITV morning show today as she discussed her split from her husband and how they manage to co-parent and continue to look after the farm. She confirmed Clive is still living nearby.

However, fans of the show were left distracted as they noticed Amanda's very glam look as she chatted about the importance of taking time for herself and making sure she was able to practice self-care and focus on herself alongside raising her large family.

Speaking about co-parenting with Clive, she confirmed he was living next door, before adding: ""It's not a big story. I feel there's so many people in similar situations. That's the reality, we all have to get on with it. There's the animals to look after, the childcare.""

Amanda looked very glamorous during her appearance on the ITV morning show today, as she also chatted about her self-care and how she prioritises herself despite looking after the whole farm and juggling parenting too.

""I am content. You do have to take a little time for yourself. Even if I'm going to be feeding the sheep, I put my moisturiser on and mascara on, it's self-care,"" she said of her new routine following her split.

Amanda previously explained to The Mirror that her kids coped fine when she was away as she opened up about the ""different challenges"" she has faced as a parent over the year, joking she hopes parenthood keeps her young.

She said: ""Years of training means they're fine. The nature of what we do means there's always something to be done, so they can bake, cook, even tidy up - usually when I give them a warning that I'm coming back!

""It's never easy, it's different challenges. But I must admit I do like being a part of their journey as they grow up and seeing them develop. Raven is away at university doing a Masters now, Reuben's working independently and loving it, Miles has left school and is working at home. It brings in new people and keeps you on your toes. I hope it keeps me young.""

She also insisted she loves getting glammed up, but is happy to balance both parts of her life.

Asked if she enjoys the showbiz side of her life aswell, she added: ""Of course I do, although I think at the moment I'd need a very big scrub and a manicure! I enjoy being not what people expect. I hate the idea of stereotyping. I might be 6ft 2in and work on the farm, but I can wear heels, stick on false eyelashes and be totally happy talking to a bunch of hill farmers while I'm doing it!""

Emmerdale's Moira Dingle could be saved from Caleb Miligan's cruel plan, with fans convinced a familiar face is about to return after seven years

Emmerdale viewers speculated a return could be on the way as others hoped it was on the cards, following a comment by a past cast member regarding the latest episode of the ITV soap.

Fans wanted the character in question to return to save Moira Dingle from her scheming brother-in-law Caleb Miligan, and village villain Kim Tate.

Moria was left with an impossible choice on Wednesday, when issues with her business led to her considering selling her farming land.

After her husband Cain Dingle's brother Caleb encouraged Moira to sell the farm to Kim, amid his plan to keep Kim on side as he continues to try to fleece her, Moira wasn't convinced.

But she was left with no choice it seemed, after Caleb sabotaged her business to push her to sell her farm to Kim - resulting in financial woes for Moira and Cain.

While Caleb's plan is to destroy Kim, over his secret link to her ex-husband Frank Tate, and steal everything she has, it seems in order to continue that plan he's throwing his own family under the bus.

Caleb had lost Kim the originally chosen land for their stud farm project, and saw an opportunity when he realised Moira's land was close to Home Farm.

Now, viewers are hoping a past character might return to help Moira and save the farm, after a cryptic comment from a former cast member of the show.

Andy Sugden actor Kelvin Fletcher, whose character used to work with Moira on her farm, teased a possible comeback on Emmerdale's Instagram, saying about the farm: ""I'll buy it.""

While it was possibly a jokey reference to the fact he owns his own farm in real life, fans took it as a sign he may return to the village after Andy fled in 2016.

Others begged the actor to reprise his role and buy the farm, amid Moira's dilemma.

Taking to Instagram, one fan said in reply to the comment: ""Yes please. I'm sure everyone would love to see you back.""

Another begged: ""please come back!"" as a third echoed this by saying: ""come back!!!""

One viewer was convinced a return was sealed, writing: ""he's coming back.""

Others called for the twist, with a fan saying: ""wouldn't that be brilliant!!! What a twist in the tale!!"" with a further comment saying: ""brilliant that would bring you back into the show.""

Emmerdale airs weeknights at 7:30pm on ITV1 and ITVX, with an hour-long episode on Thursdays.

Jessie Wynter was greeted by her boyfriend Will Young's parents as the Love Island couple landed back in London just one day after Farmer Will found himself embroiled in a row with Casey O'Gorman on live TV

Love Island lovebirds Will Young and Jessie Wynter have landed back in the UK after a whirlwind two months where they fell head over heels for one another - but not without any obstacles.

TikTok sensation farmer Will, 23, and Australian bombshell Jessie, 26, are set to kickstart their love story in the real world after the pair documented their arrival back on UK soil on Monday as the pair seemingly missed the grande finale where fellow contestants Kai Fagan and Shanam Harrinanan were crowned the 2023 winners.

Taking to her Instagram stories after the final, Jessie shared a collection of sweet snaps of herself and her boyfriend Will in the airport after they made it to the last five couples in the villa before being booted out ahead of the final.

An excited Jessie posed alongside her beau in the baggage collection area of the London airport while sporting a dressed down look which included a pair of grey jogging bottoms and an off-the-shoulder black top.

Jessie and Will appeared to be wearing accidental matching outfits as the TikTok star also modelled some joggers and an oversized black t-shirt as she wrapped his arm around his girlfriend's waist in the sweet snap.

""Hellooooo London,"" Jessie captioned the snap - hinting that she may be staying around for longer than she anticipated after falling head over heels for Will.

In another wholesome snap, Jessie posed alongside Will's parents after they were all reunited following the couple's whirlwind experience in the South African villa.

""Heart is so full right now,"" Jessie wrote alongside the cute photo before thanking her followers for their love and support.

""I cannot explain how grateful I am,"" the Aussie bombshell added.

Will and Jessie's return back to London comes after the couple faced an awkward encounter with dumped islander Casey O'Gorman on Sunday night's Aftersun, where farmer Will branded his so-called friend as a 'snake' after discovering that Casey was speaking badly about Jessie behind his back.

During the explosive Aftersun episode, the couple were shown clips from their time on the show and were shocked to see Casey share his thoughts and claimed Jessie was being 'fake' and 'playing games' with her now-boyfriend, Farmer Will.

A clip was shown of Casey speaking to Maxwell, saying: ""The way she was speaking to me, it seemed like such an act.""

Another video saw Casey and Will discussing the accusations, with him claiming it was Maxwell who instigated the speculation.

Speaking to Will, Casey said: ""He doesn't feel she's being genuine,"" before the farmer asked: ""Do you think she's being genuine?"" before Casey dramatically claimed: ""Yeah, I think she is.""

However, it appeared to become too much for Will as he directed his anger towards Casey who was sitting in the Aftersun audience before loudly branding him a 'snake'.

Later in the dramatic episode, the camera showed Will and Casey sitting at the same table and it appeared that they were still in a rather heated exchange although it is not clear what they were saying.

The ex-wife of Amanda Owen's rumoured new partner has warned her to 'be very careful' and 'think of her children' as she claims he 'loves fame'

The ex-wife of Amanda Owen' s rumoured partner has reportedly warned the shepherdess to ""be very careful"".

The farming sensation, 48, is said to be dating businessman Robert Davies, 71, following her shock split from husband and Our Yorkshire Farm co-star Clive last summer.

Amanda's new beau is believed to have had five marriages and his fourth wife Jan Coates, 72, has offered a warning to the TV star.

Jan was married to Robert for just two years, after their relationship broke down in 2002 when he ""had an affair"".

Amanda is thought to be thriving in her new relationship and is said to be 'inseparable' from her new man, but is yet to publicly confirm or deny the rumours about her love life.

""That's what he does, gets married, have an affair and move on,"" Jan told Mail Online.

""He is very charming but he is also very ruthless in the way he treats people. I think he gets bored easily. I can see what's happened. He loves fame and fortune and he loves money.""

Jan offered a message to Amanda, saying: ""Once somebody is in love with someone they don't want to know. I would just say be very careful and think about your children.""

Robert's wife wife Yusami, 56, is said to have been left in shock after the businessman walked out of the family home and ended their 12-year marriage after confessing to an having an affair with Amanda.

Yusami's friends claim she discovered the relationship last year when she found a love letter to her husband while cleaning out his car.

A source close to Yusami told Mail Online : ""She is absolutely heartbroken by what's happened. She can't believe it. She gave up a career in banking after meeting Rob in Tokyo and he persuaded her to leave all of her family and friends in Japan to start a new life with him in the UK.

""Now he has left her on her own to start a new relationship with Amanda. She is so upset and lonely.""

Amanda and her ex-husband Clive, 68, were married for 21 years and have nine children but announced they were separating last June.

At the time, Amanda and Clive released a joint statement which read: ""Clive and I are sad to confirm that we have made the difficult decision to separate.

""This hasn't been easy, but we both believe it's the right choice for the future of our family. Although we are no longer a couple, we continue to work on the farm and co-parent together, with our number one priority being the happiness and well-being of our children.""

Amanda was seen pictured with Robert four years ago.

In a Facebook post from December 2018 Robert shared a picture of himself with Amanda and wrote: ""Have you been watching Channel 5 's series ' Our Yorkshire Farm ' about the Yorkshire Shepherdess?

""I really enjoyed working on her website earlier this year, and very happy that she loves it!""

The Mirror has contacted Amanda's representatives for comment.

Lexi Thompson will become the seventh female golfer to compete on the PGA Tour at the Shriners Children's Open, but her invite was labelled a 'gimmick' by Peter Malnati

PGA Tour regular Peter Malnati labelled Lexi Thompson's invite to compete at next week's Shriners Children's Open a ""gimmick"", before quickly backtracking on his comments.

Thompson was offered the chance to compete in the men's field at the upcoming tournament, at TPC Summerlin in Las Vegas and duly accepted. In doing so the 11-time LPGA Tour winner and Solheim Cup star will become the seventh female golfer to compete on the PGA Tour.

Following Thompson's exemption for the the Vegas-based tournament Malnati was questioned on his thoughts, and despite having some kind words for the American appeared to quickly regret his response.

Speaking at this week's Sanderson Farms Championship, the Tour star said: ""I just got a text this morning, so I don't know much about it,"" Malnati said of Thompson's invite. ""Obviously I know that Lexi at times has been one of the top players on the LPGA Tour, and she's obviously very athletic.

""Distance won't be a problem. She'll hit it far enough... I don't think we're going to need to resort to gimmicks to drum up interest."" After labelling the invite as a 'gimmick' to increase interest in the FedEx Cup fall event, he quickly added: ""I shouldn't have said that.

""I don't know that having Lexi play is a gimmick, but I don't think the tournaments are going to have to go to those kind of lengths to drum up interest and get storylines that they can sell because I think these events are actually going to have a lot of meaning.

""Like I said, change is hard for everyone at every level, so I assume if you're a host organization of a tournament, if you're the Century Club here in Jackson, if you're Wayne Sanderson Farms, you just don't know right now for sure what you have anymore because the fall is completely reimagined.

""I'm pretty sure that the fall is going to be a blockbuster hit. I think it's going to be very successful. But these tournaments, they don't know yet."" Thompson meanwhile is more than looking forward to compete against male competition, and is hoping to inspire the next generation of female players.

""I'm hopeful that my ability to play with the men next week at the Shriners Children's Open sends a great message to the young women,"" the former major winner commented. ""You can chase your dream regardless of how hard it is.""

Larry the lamb and Del the duck have grown inseparable and are often spotted grooming each other after finding common ground in their difficult upbringings

An unlikely friendship has flourished between a sheep and a duck who were raised together on a farm after being rejected by their parents.

Shortly after Larry the lamb was born in May, staff at Farmer Palmer's Farm Park near Poole, Dorset, started to worry that something was wrong with him as he became increasingly distant.

Around the same time, a farm hand rescued a duckling that had been abandoned by its family, taking it in and naming it Del.

Katy Lester, animal manager at the farm, decided that it would be a good idea to group the two strays together.

They quickly became inseparable.

Del and Larry now do everything together and when they are separated they quack and bleat to be brought back together.

They are often spotted grooming each other in the evenings.

Katy said: ""It was so heartwarming seeing them grow together and they are completely inseparable now.

""We were worried that Larry had some hearing issue that meant he was never properly accepted as a member of the flock.

""When Del was brought in limping and abandoned we thought that they would be the perfect pair.

""Now they chatter away to each other and groom each other on evenings, it's just lovely to see.

""Everyone that comes to visit the farm thinks it's lovely, we are so glad it has worked out for them both.""

It's not the first time the two species have come together in perfect harmony.

In 2015 a duckling was captured grooming a lamb's woollen coat in what the owner called ""a heartwarming sign of trust and friendship"".

The clip showed the lamb lowering its head down to the duck and staying still while the baby duck pecked away at its head and neck.

And just as the lamb looked as if it was walking away, it can then be seen sitting down and letting the duckling continue its grooming session.

""What could be mistaken as pecking is actually a heartwarming sign of trust and friendship,"" the owner told the Daily Mail.

""The duck pecks out little clumps of debris that gets stuck in Winter's woollen coat.

""They seem so comfortable with each other that Winter can just lay down on the grass for a nap and let his feathered friend do what he does best.""

Telegram channel General SVR claims that president Vladimir Putin died on Thursday - the channel has alleged that his body has since been stored in a deep freezer

The body of Vladimir Putin has allegedly been stored in a freezer following rumours of his death, according to a Telegram channel.

The channel doubled down on its claims that the Russian president has died on Thursday night at around 8:42pm in Moscow time. The channel alleged that his body had been placed in a freezer used for deep-frozen food.

General SVR has reported that medics who were caring for Putin have been forced to stay inside his Valdai palace. Secret service operatives have reportedly locked the doctors in several rooms.

The channel further claimed that senior aides are preparing a body double to take over as the president so he can rule Russia without question. However, the Kremlin has disputed the rumours and branded them ""absurd"". It comes after General SVR has continued to claim that his health has deteriorated over the years due to cancer.

Despite the Kremlin denial, the unsourced channel claimed Dmitry Kochnev, 59, director of the Federal Guard Service, has launched a security operation to mask the dictator's death. ""At about 20.00 Moscow time, the doctors on duty called an additional team of doctors, who upon arrival, within fifteen minutes, began resuscitating the president,"" said the channel.

""By that time, Putin's condition was critical. At 20.42 Moscow time, doctors stopped resuscitation and pronounced the president dead. After informing the security officers on duty at the door about what had happened. By personal order of Dmitry Kochnev, the room in the presidential residence in Valdai, which was converted into an intensive care ward in which Putin died, was blocked.""

The channel added: ""The doctors remained locked with the president's corpse. Security officers ordered the doctors to calm down, not make noise and wait."" In a later post the channel alleged: ""No respect for the deceased. Putin's corpse was placed in a freezer, which previously contained deep-frozen food, at the presidential residence in Valdai. The doctors who took part in the treatment and resuscitation of Putin were distributed among several rooms in the residence and continue to be held by the president's security service.""

The channel claimed Nikolay Patrushev, 72, Putin's top security aide, was issuing orders that Kochev was carrying out. ""By order of Kochnev, the security of the president's double was strengthened. Now the question, including the future fate of doctors, is being resolved. Negotiations on the creation of a coalition of representatives of the pro-Putin elites under the leadership of Nikolai Patrushev are almost completed to preserve the current regime and use Putin's double in the image of the president.""

Political analyst Dr Valery Solovoy, said Patrushev plans to use this double until the New Year and then decide what to do next, including whether the doppelgÃ¤nger will take part in elections. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov branded the death claim an ""absurd information canard"". Earlier this week he had strongly denied Putin suffered a heart attack last weekend, and said reports the Russian president used a doppelgÃ¤nger were false.

Patrushev, 72, is secretary of Russia's powerful Security Council, and Putin's top intelligence advisor. General SVR has claimed he is in pole position to succeed the president but may wish power for his son, agriculture minister Dmitry Patrushev, 46. The channel has claimed for months that Putin was ill and replaced by actors trained by the security services who underwent plastic surgery to look like the dictator.

Solovey, a former professor at Moscow's prestigious Institute of International Relations [MGIMO], a training academy for spies and diplomats. He said recently: ""The fact is that the current President Vladimir Putin is living out the last days of his earthly life."" The head of Ukrainian military intelligence Lt-Gen Kyrylo Budanov has alleged the real Putin has not been seen since June 2022. ""The one, who everyone used to know, was last seen around 26 June 2022,"" he said last month.

A recent Japanese TV report used AI to analyse Putin's face, walk and voice in multiple appearances and concluded that he does use one and perhaps two body doubles. ""I can tell you there are no doubles when it comes to work and so on,"" said Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier this week.

The spokesman continued: ""These [kinds of stories] belong to the category of fake news, discussed with enviable tenacity by a number of media outlets. This brings nothing but a smile [in the Kremlin]."" Solovey predicted that Putin's lover Alina Kabaeva and secret family would leave for the Emirates after his death. General SVR is supposedly run by a former Kremlin lieutenant-general, known by the alias Viktor Mikhailovich. Russian social media was awash with memes linked to the Putin death claim. One showed multiple body doubles with one asking: ""So who died"". Another showed a meeting of the supposed doppelgÃ¤ngers.

It comes following a multistate Listeria outbreak related to the Big Olaf Creamery in Sarasota, Florida, with multiple flavours impacted and the company forced to recall products after an investigation

Three people have died after eating contaminated ice cream this year with another eight becoming seriously ill and needing to be hospitalised.

Six people in Washington and two from New York and Pennsylvania have contracted Listeria as a result of eating contaminated ice cream from two separate brands. Those in Washington were listed as having consumed Frugals ice cream while the others in New York and Pennsylvania had eaten Real Kosher ice cream.

It's not the first outbreak of Listeria connected to ice cream, with a huge multistate outbreak reported in 2021-2022. Of those, 23 people became ill, 22 were hospitalised and one person died with the brand identified as Big Olaf Creamery, according to the Food Poison Journal.

Mrs Billman enjoyed an ice cream at the Big Olaf Creamery in Sarasota, Florida in January 2022. She died of a Listeria infection on January 29, 2022, leaving behind a husband, children and grandchildren.

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.

It's thought Mrs Billman fell ill on or around January 27 that year and had symptoms consistent with Listeria. She was admitted to Memorial Regional Hospital South on January 27 where a stool sample tested positive for Listeria serotype ST5. Mrs Billman died on January 29 and the family was left with medical bills of $89,698.02 (£70,274).

Further testing confirmed that her Listeria was associated with the 'multistate cluster' identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This was the Listeria outbreak associated with Big Olaf's ice cream.

Listeria can contaminate a wide range of food, with most infections caused by eating chilled, ready-to-eat foods, such as cooked sliced meats and cured meats, smokes meat and cured fish (including sushi), cooked shellfish, soft mould-ripened cheese such as camembert and blue-veined cheese, pÃ¢tÃ©, pre-prepared sandwiches and salads, pre-cut fruit, unpasteurised milk and dairy products made from unpasteurised milk.

Listeriosis, the infection caused by listeria has no symptoms or only causes mild symptoms for a few days such as a high temperature, aches and pains, chills, feeling or being sick and diarrhoea. It usually goes away on its own, but it can make some people seriously ill.

As of June 29, 2022, a total of 23 people infected with the outbreak strain of Listeria monocytogenes had been reported from 10 states. Of the 22 people there was information for, 20 sick people reported living in or travelling to Florida in the month they got sick - although the significance of this is under investigation.

People became ill on dates ranging from January 24, 2021, through to June 12, 2022. The Florida Department of Health, CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several other states and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) collected different types of data to investigate the multistate outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections.

As a result of the investigation Big Olaf Creamery in Sarasota voluntarily contacted retail locations to recommend against selling their ice cream products. Consumers who have Big Olaf Creamery brand ice cream at home should throw away any remaining product.

People are being interviewed by public health officials about the foods they ate in the month before they got sick. Of the 17 interviewed, 14 of them, or 82 per cent, reported eating ie cream. Among the 13 who remembered details about which ice cream they ate, six reported eating Big Olaf Creamery ice cream or eating ice cream at a location that might have been supplied by Big Olaf Creamery.

Listeria was found on equipment in the ice cream processing facility and in 16 of 17 flavours. At first, Big Olaf refused to recognise that it was the cause of the outbreak and refused to stop production and stop ice cream sales.

The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS): ""The results from product sampling taken from the Big Olaf production facility last week by FDACS found that 16 of the 17 flavours tested were positive for Listeria monocytogenes (L mono).""

The impacted flavours were:

The FDACS said: ""With these results, FDACS is currently issuing formal stop sales on the 16 products where L. mono was found, which were previously part of a voluntary recall. Our department continues to work closely with our state and federal partners on this investigation and enforcement of the stop sale.""

The Algarve in Portugal, which has more than 100 beaches stretching for many than 200km, has been voted as ""˜Europe's Leading Beach Destination' at the 2023 World Travel Awards

A sunny region a three hour journey away from the UK has been named the best beach destination on the Continent for a 10th year.

The Algarve has been voted as ""˜Europe's Leading Beach Destination' at the 2023 World Travel Awards. Home to more than 100 beaches, the region in Portugal has some of Europe's most beautiful coastline in the world and stretches for more than 200km. There are 88 blue flag beaches in the Algarve - an award giving to the cleanest beaches with the best facilities and purist water - making it one of the largest concentration of Blue Flags in Europe.

If you are planning a trip to the Algarve then there are plenty of beaches that are worth a visit. The Praia da FalÃ©sia is a long straight strip of sand 10km east of Albufeira which offers one of the region's most impressive first views. It is a great spot to visit with family as there is plenty of room for everyone to run around, dig a big hole or simply relax in the sun.

The beach on the ilha de Cabanas near to Tavira requires a little bit of work to get to, located as it is across the river from Cabanas village on a spit of land squished next to the sea. The beach has a unique blend of fresh and salt water flora, fauna and wildlife, making it an ideal location for nature lovers.

The Ria Formosa national park is an area of outstanding natural beauty that has a series of small islands within it, with the Armona Island - home to home to a stunning beach - probably the most notable. You can only access this island by water taxi or ferry, with regular boat trips taking place throughout the day.

If you are a fan of throwing caution and your trousers to the wind, then the naturist beach on Tavira island is worth a visit. It is one of five official naturist beaches in Portugal. To get to the island you need to catch a ferry from the little port just outside Tavira and then walk for 15 minutes.

Getting there doesn't need to be expensive either. On Skyscanner you can find flights from just £27 each way although it's worth noting the cheapest tickets tend to be outside of the peak summer season.

Speaking about winning the award, President of the Algarve Tourism Bureau AndrÃ© Gomes said: ""We are honoured and delighted to have won this award for the tenth time. It's a real privilege for the region to have been recognised as Europe's Leading Beach Destination, and to be making history this way.

""The Algarve has beaches to suit all tastes. From long, sandy beaches protected by golden cliffs to small bays nestled between rocks, and the calm waters of the east coast beaches like Manta Rota and Altura, which are perfect for families. Meanwhile, the west coast beaches of Amado, Bordeira and Monte Clerigo have some of the most scenic and uncrowded in the country and are a go-to destination for surfers. There also famous beach resort towns such as Albufeira, Lagos and Vilamoura, all with fine beaches.

""And complementing the beaches, we have a rich culture and tradition, with a long history of fishing, agriculture, crafts and gastronomy that has been shaped and influenced by its long Atlantic coastline, Moorish ancestry and sunny climate.""

Retiree June Armstrong, 77, from New Zealand, was flying into Brisbane, Australia in May but had forgotten that she was carrying a sandwich - which can be considered a biohazard to the country's notoriously strict customs control

An elderly pensioner faced a costly nightmare after forgetting a sandwich in her backpack while flying abroad.

June Armstrong, 77, from New Zealand, was at Christchurch Airport for an early-morning flight in May when she picked up a muffin and gluten-free chicken a lettuce sandwich. Eating the muffin, she completely forgot about the sandwich - which was sealed - and left it in her bag thinking she'd go back to it during the three-and-a-half hour flight.

During the flight, the 77-year-old decided to have a snooze so didn't have the urge to fish out her sandwich. Even when she reached Australian customs - which is notoriously strict when it comes to food items - she forgot she had it and therefore forgot to declare. It wasn't until Australian Border Force officials checked her backpack that she realised the pricey mistake she'd made.

At the airport she burst into tears after being slapped with an eye-watering £1,731 fine. Speaking to the New Zealand Herald, she said: ""I was just sobbing and said '$3,300 for a little sandwich?""

She had the option to appeal within the 28-day payment period, but after getting nothing but automatic responses, she ended up coughing up the hefty sum so she wouldn't be breaching the deadline.

""My husband kept saying, ""Just pay it"". I said, ""It's our pension, we can't afford this"".' June is still contesting the fine, which she says has been gruelling and taken a toll on her physical and mental health.

In her submission to the Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, she wrote: ""I think of it night and day, I now am on sleeping tablets. I am consumed by how much this fine was and how much it will affect our lives."" Australian officials have yet to respond to her requests and she says she's becoming resigned to the fact that this fine may be upheld. Instead, she hopes that her experience will help others to not make the same mistakes.

""I should let it go, and my husband says I should, but they just don't give me any answers,"" Ms Armstrong said, adding: ""Everybody I show the fine to is dumbfounded, they just can't believe it."" According to Australian customs rules, food items being transported into Australia must be declared on their incoming passenger card.

The ABF website explains: ""Biosecurity officers may need to inspect some of the food you're bringing with you."" Bread products are allowed to be brought in for personal consumption but they are a problem if they contain meat or uncanned animal products, reports the MailOnline. For travellers who fail to declare the items which pose a ""high level of biosecurity risk"", they can be fined $3756 depending on ""the risk of the goods"".

Stoke-on Trent recorded 860 complaints about smell last year and has the dubious honour of being the stinkiest authority in the UK the survey by Airmatic has found

A city has been named the 'stinkiest' place after receiving 1000 smell complaints every year.

The place with the most complaints about stenches last year was has been revealed as Stoke-on-Trent City Council

It notched-up 860 complaints about smell last year and has the honour of being the stinkiest authority in England.

The complaints average almost two and a half per day, and the Staffordshire city helped make it a one-two for the West Midlands, joined by Birmingham, with the second city receiving a total of 649.

In the top 10 of all the locations which were the 'stinkiest places' in England, the cities also included Westminster, Leeds and Swindon were also listed in the chart.

Claire Watson, an odour expert at Airmatic which carried out the study, said bad smells can affect our health.

She said: ""Odour complaints are a direct result of air pollution in an area.

""This can have a negative effect on the health and well-being of the residents in such areas with them breathing in air pollutants.

""These can enter our bloodstream and contribute to coughing or itchy eyes and cause or worsen many respiratory conditions.

""Aside from the physical health impacts, there are also the negative mental effects on residents living day to day exposed to such odours.""

Other cities which also took a place on the list included the cities of Portsmouth, Bradford and Nottingham,.

Three London boroughs were also represented in Westminster, Kensington, Chelsea and Bexley - which gathered 1,694 complaints in total

There were other areas, however, which scored low in smell complaints.

The fewest number of odour complaints were recorded in Yorkshire which had 42, followed East Riding in Yorkshire with just 66 complaints.

There was one location, Norwich, which had the honour of being the nicest-smelling location with zero reports of bad smells.

Businesses need Environment Agency permits if their work falls into manufacturing, agriculture and energy sectors and have any activity which can pollute air, water or land.

The top two places with the highest number of complaints about businesses in these areas were the West Midlands and London.

For every 28 businesses operating there was one complaint in three sectors in the West Midlands area and one for every 54 in London.

In 2021 The Mirror reported how residents in 'Britain's smelliest village' claimed the stench coming from a landfill site is causing an ""off-the-scale environmental disaster"".

In February, locals reported a nauseating eggy stench like ""rotting flesh"" or ""dirty nappies"" coming from Walleys Quarry in Silverdale, Staffordshire.

Angry residents have been forced to tape up their doors and put bags over their windows to try to stop the vile smell getting into their homes.

Some say the so-called The Silverdale Stink is so unpleasant it burns the back of their throat.

Others have reported headaches, asthma attacks, stress, anxiety and sleeplessness and are demanding something is done about the problem in Newcastle-under-Lyme.

The Harry Potter set provided an unlikely setting for romance over the cast and crew's 10 year history, from teenage crushes, complicated love triangles, a nine year relationship and even an engagement

The much-loved Harry Potter move franchise changed the lives of its cast forever, not only shooting them to stardom but also influencing their love lives.

Putting together a group of teens and watching them grow up together on screen, undoubtedly influenced many crushes and romances. Just this week a pair of co-stars confessed to having a secret romance for nine years after meeting on set. The film series also gave some of the cast their very first crushes.

Some turned into real-life relationships as one couple were set to walk down the aisle. While others were kept as just teenage crushes, that resulted in a very awkward but sweet love letter being sent. The Harry Potter series rehashed a complicated love triangle between the adult stars, whilst also building life-long relationships. We take a look at all the ups and downs from the Harry Potter romances that blossomed on set.

Nine year secret romance

Luna Lovegood actress Evanna Lynch recently spilled on her secret nine year romance with a Harry Potter co-star, which she kept from the public eye. The Irish star dated Robbie Jarvis, who played a young James Potter, for nine years before splitting up in 2016. The actors first met in 2007 after they were both cast in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, before embarking on a lowkey romance that they mostly kept out of the public eye.

Evanna even convinced Robbie to quit eating meat, dairy and eggs while they were together, after sharing with him graphic information about the animal agriculture industry during a trip to New Zealand. Despite keeping things lowkey, the Luna Lovegood actress paid tribute to her Harry Potter beau in a sweet public tribute in May 2015, taking to Instagram to wish her ""sweetest boy"" a ""happy 29th birthday"" and revealing their plans to see a show together. After breaking up, they remained amicable and continued to attend vegan events together.

Wedding plans

Bonnie Wright, who played Ginny Weasley in the series, dated Stranger Things star Jamie Campbell Bower after their time in Harry Potter together, and even got engaged. Gellert Grindelwald actor Jamie, who played the wizard in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, started dating the youngest Weasley in 2010. Bonnie confirmed the romance, stating: ""Yes, we're dating. We've been seeing each other for a few months, it's good.""

The following year the pair got engaged, however sadly split in 2012. A source at the time told US Weekly: ""It was amicable, but things had not been going right for some time. It's sad."" Bonnie has since moved on with her husband Andrew Lococo, who she is currently expecting her first child with. While last year, Jamie opened up about his past 'active addiction' as he celebrated 7.5 years of sobriety.

Messy love triangle

It wasn't just the teenagers who were swept up in romances on the Harry Potter set. Three adult actors all had to put their differences aside as they joined the movie franchise following a complicated love affair. Kenneth Branagh, who appeared in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as Gilderoy Lockhart, fell in love with Helena Bonham Carter, who portrayed Bellatrix Lestrange, when they worked together on Frankenstein in 1994.

However, they started their romance when Kenneth was still married to Emma Thompson. He divorced Emma in 1995, and then dated Helena for several years before splitting up in 1999. Emma Thompson, who appeared in the franchise as Sybill Trelawney, said that, while it was difficult, she made her peace with Helena eventually. Things are now good between everyone involved.

Sweet crush

Emma Watson and Tom Felton have been fighting off romance rumours for years. Having met when they were just children, some may say it was only natural for them to develop crushes as they grew up together. Emma has since confessed to having a ""massive crush"" on the Draco Malfoy star, admitting: ""I used to come in every day and look for his number on the call sheet. It was number 7. And if his number was on the call sheet, it was an extra exciting day.""

The Hermione actress did eventually outgrow her crush, but they have both shared how they have a special relationship with each other. ""We are something, if that makes any sense. We've been very close for a long time. I adore her. I think she's fantastic. Hopefully she returns the compliment,"" Tom said. ""Emma and I have always loved each other. I became very protective over her [as kids] ... I've always had a soft spot for her, and that continues to this day."" Emma shared ""nothing has ever ever ever ever happened romantically with us. We just love each other. That's all I can say about that.""

Teenage infatuation

Daniel Radcliffe developed such a huge crush on his co-star that he even wrote a love letter. The Harry Potter star confessed he had a thing for Helena Bonham Carter, which the whole crew knew about. During the cast reunion to mark 20 years of the films, Daniel shared a very sweet love letter he gave Helena many years ago.

It read: ""Dear HBC, it was a pleasure being your costar and coaster in the sense that I always ended up holding your coffee. I do love you, and I just wish I had been born 10 years earlier I might [have had] a chance. Lots of love and thanks for being cool."" The two of them can still laugh about the moment all these years later.

Hundreds of angry fishermen gathered in Rennes, France, to protest worrying recommendations made by the country's Council of State in relation to the costly carbonisation of the sector

Angry fishermen fearing for their futures reportedly threw live crabs at police during bloody clashes in France.

Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Rennes on Wednesday to protest ""the regulations and persecution of the direction of maritime affairs"", according to an open letter to President Emmanuel Macron.

The sector is facing a costly carbonisation and recruitment crisis.

Olivier Le NÃ©zet, head of the country's National Fisheries Committee, went on to say the treatment of the industry has evoked ""aggressions"", with French fleets being decreased by more than a quarter in 20 years.

The ill-feeling came to a head earlier this week when the highest administrative court, the Council of State, gave the government six months to close some fishing areas in the Atlantic.

The move was made in a bid to protect dolphin populations in the Bay of Biscay.

Mr Le NÃ©zet said fishermen have been involved in programs to ""determine avoidance solutions"" to help protect the aquatic mammals while continuing fishing activities for the last five years.

He said 560 of the netters in the Bay are participating in the action plan, and while accepting more can be done, ""you can't ask a trawler to become a netter overnight"".

""The Council of State has just called everything into question,"" he said, asking the President for ""a pause in this avalanche of bad moves"".

Mr Le NÃ©zet has, however, condemned yesterday's violent clashes, which are also said to have seen a tractor reportedly used against the police.

One particularly graphic photo shows a bloodied protestor, with a bandage around his face, being detained by a riot officer.

Under fire President Macron assured fishermen of his support on the issue at the annual Paris International Agricultural Show earlier this month.

It comes as Macron continues to stubbornly resist growing discontent on the streets of his country after his forcing through of a pensions bill without a vote caused nationwide unrest.

He said yesterday the bill - which would see the retirement aged raised from 62 to 64 - must be implemented by the end of the year.

After his interview broadcast on national television, critics attacked Macron, describing him as ""self-satisfied,"" ""out of touch"" and ""offensive.""

Some suggested that the president is playing with fire amid strikes and daily demonstrations, some leading to clashes with police.

Unions have called for nationwide protests today that are likely to further raise tensions.

""He is in absolute denial,"" said Olivier Faure, the head of the Socialist Party.

""It's as though there's a well lit fire and he is pouring jerrycans of gas on the flames.""

The president's remarks Wednesday were his first since the government finally forced the pension bill through parliament last week, then survived two no-confidence votes in the lower chamber of parliament on Monday.

France's Constitutional Council will review the bill in the coming weeks, and it can only be turned into law after the body gives its approval.

Many Londoners have blasted the new low emissions rules on some of the city's roads, but there are a number of exemptions and discounts available to help you avoid paying

The new ULEZ rules have been controversial, but data shows it has already had a hugely positive effect on the overall health of people in central London. Still, there are a number of ways drivers of certain vehicles can get around the fee.

Classic cars are completely exempt, for instance, as are the city's black cabs (under certain conditions). Certain types of farm vehicle qualify, as do builders driving ""certain types of mobile crane"", or ""non-road going vehicles which are allowed to drive on the highway [for example, excavators]"".

'Showman's vehicles' are also exempt, TfL confirmed. The conditions are that the vehicle has to be either used in a performance, used to carry equipment, or provide the performance, used for displaying animals, or have modifications which means emission abatement equipment cannot be fitted.

According to MyLondon, all London-licensed taxis are exempt, though older more polluting taxis are subject to a 12-year age limit with cleaner ones being extended to 15 years. All newly licensed taxis must be zero emission capable (ZEC) vehicles.

When it comes to classic cars, or what TfL calls 'historic vehicles', there are two categories - all vehicles built before January 1, 1973 and those more than 40 years old that have been successfully registered with the DVLA for a historic vehicle tax class.

The authority said that if your vehicle meets either of the above criteria but is registered outside the UK, it is also exempt but it must be registered with TfL online. As to the others, those that are disabled whose vehicle is registered with the DVLA as having 'disabled' or 'disabled passenger vehicle' tax class will get a grace period of no charges until October 24, 2027.

Motors with tax classes registered abroad will have to register with TfL to benefit, however. Wheelchair-accessible vehicles with permanent ramps, hoists, swivel seats, or accelerator rings will also have a grace period until October 25, 2027.

Those claiming certain disability benefits will also benefit from a grace period until 25 October 25, 2027, and these benefits include:

Other factors that would mean you qualify include: if you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of three with a medical condition that means the child always needs to be accompanied by bulky medical equipment; are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of three with a medical condition that means the child always needs to be near a vehicle in case they need emergency medical treatment; are registered blind or have a terminal illness, which means you cannot walk or find walking very difficult.

There are a few other discounts and exemptions available, such as with military vehicles, while specialist agricultural vehicles are also exempt. NHS patients who are too ill to travel on public transport can claim back ULEZ payments from the hospital they attend.

And a short period of exemption is available to small businesses (under 50 employees), micro-businesses (up to 10 employees), charities, and sole traders with a registered address in one of the 32 London boroughs or the City of London, who have either ordered a new light van or minibus that meets the ULEZ emissions standards or are having their light van or minibus, that does not meet the ULEZ emissions standards, retrofitted by a Clean Vehicle Retrofit Accreditation Scheme (CVRAS) approved fitter to meet the ULEZ emissions standards.

The two men - named only as Zheng and Wang - were arrested for allegedly smashing a path through a section of the ancient Great Wall of China to use as a shortcut to their work site

China's Great Wall has been pierced by Genghis Khan, the Manchus, and now, allegedly, a couple of construction workers named Zheng and Wang who wanted a shortcut.

Authorities in China arrested the two men for smashing a path through a section of the ancient wall, a cultural icon and United Nations protected heritage site. The area of the breach was a broken-down section far from the restored segments most Chinese and foreign tourists are familiar with.

State media showed a dirt road cut through a the wall against a rural landscape in Youyu County, hundreds of miles west of Beijing, and identified the suspects only by the surnames Zheng and Wang. The pair wanted a shorter route for some construction work they were doing in nearby towns, the reports said.

China places immense pride in the system of towers and connecting walls wide enough for carriages to pass that stretch approximately 5,500 miles, built mainly during the Ming dynasty that lasted until 1644. In that year, Manchu tribespeople from the north overcame China's defences and took over the empire as the Qing dynasty.

The wall was subsequently abandoned and plundered for bricks and stones by local villagers, only to be revived by the Communist government as a symbol of patriotism, mass mobilisation and resistance to outside pressure. The Youyu County government said the arrests were made after a report of the breach was received on August 24. It said the two men were in custody with further legal action pending.

In its citation of the the Great Wall, UNESCO described it as reflecting the ""collision and exchanges between agricultural civilizations and nomadic civilisations in ancient China."" The citation added: ""It provides significant physical evidence of the far-sighted political strategic thinking and mighty military and national defence forces of central empires in ancient China, and is an outstanding example of the superb military architecture, technology and art of ancient China.""

Baby name experts from BabyCentre have shared their top predictions for the monikers that will be a big hit with parents throughout 2023 - with new trends such as Bambi and space-themed

Each year baby name trends come and go, with the list of the most popular names shifting and changing as parents choose their favourites and some monikers rise up, while others sadly fall from the charts.

Most recently people have been abuzz after former Love Islander Molly-Mae Hague and her partner Tommy Fury announced they'd named their daughter 'Bambi'.

Some people went wild for the name, while others cruelly trolled the couple for their choice.

But it seems cute Disney-themed names could become incredibly popular with parents this year, according to Sarah Redshaw, the UK Managing Editor for BabyCentre.

She told the Mirror: ""It's a possibility that parents may take the lead from celebrities and their recent Disney-inspired names. Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury named their newborn daughter Bambi, and Stacey Dooley called hers Minnie so we could see an increase in searches for Disney names.""

However, while this could be popular, it doesn't look set to be the biggest baby name trend of 2023, as this honour goes to wild west-inspired names.

Sarah claims this is a move that none of the baby name experts ever saw coming, but it seems expectant parents just can't stop searching their website for monikers that would be fit for a little cowgirl or cowboy.

As such BabyCentre believes we can expect to see more babies named Billy, Butch, Wyatt, Pearl, Daisy and Clementine being welcomed into the world over the coming months.

The experts went on to claim that outer space names will also dazzle parents, with Apollo, Cosmo, Ariel and Luna all being good options.

Other trends you may see cropping up in 2023 include gemstone names like Ruby and Jet as well as old-fashioned and classy-sounding names such as Tybalt, Tamara and Barnaby.

Gender-neutral names continue to be popular with BabyCentre users as well, with the number of names in their registrations that are shared by both boys and girls doubling over the last 10 years.

The most popular gender-neutral registrations are currently Riley, Frankie, Harley, Blake, Rowan, River, Robin and Morgan.

Sarah added: ""Who could have predicted that wild west names would be a new trend? We'll be looking out for more babies named Billy, Wyatt, Butch and Levi and Clementine, Daisy, Pearl and Mae later this year when we look at our registrations.

""And one thing's for sure, old-fashioned names are still in fashion while parents are still loving Bible names.

""Meanwhile names from ancient mythology and the planets could become a new classical trend though as mums and dads look for something more unusual but familiar.""

UK sea life is far more exotic than many people think, with hundreds of different types of fish and colourful corals - but there's also a range of terrifying creatures that are becoming more popular on our beaches

There are about 330 different types of fish in the UK, as the colder waters make it an ideal temperature for sea life.

But there's also a whole range of different types of sea creature that also inhabit our shores.

As the world gets unnaturally warmer through man-made climate change, British waters are getting warmer too...

...and that means some exotic sea creatures are becoming far more popular on the UK coast.

Sharks

There are more than 40 different species of shark living in or visiting the UK's waters, according to the Marine Conservation Society (MCS).

They include basking sharks, mako sharks, thresher sharks, and even Greenland sharks.

But, great white sharks and other warm-water species could now become more popular as the ocean gets warmer.

Chris Fischer, founder of Ocearch, told the Times: ""We believe that Mediterranean white sharks should be moving north to feed on seals, like all the other populations we have worked on.

""We believe they should be moving up past Brest [in Brittany] and Cornwall.""

Jellyfish

Unusual jellyfish species are cropping up more often on UK beaches, it's been revealed.

There were 11 species spotted around the UK at the end of last summer, which is more than the usual eight.

Bioluminescent crystal jellyfish made up about three percent of all jellyfish sightings last year, according to the MCS.

The species - which is completely transparent and gives off a shimmery green-blue light - is usually found in the warmer Pacific Ocean waters.

Amy Pilsbury, the citizen science project lead at the MCS, said: ""Changes in jellyfish abundance can be affected by lots of different climate change factors, like sea surface temperature, salinity, pH, oxygen availability and habitat changes.

""Future climates will change marine dynamics even further and continue to influence planktonic communities.""

Portuguese man o'war

Despite looking similar, Portuguese man o'war are actually different from jellyfish.

Their long tendrils can reach 30m underneath the water, and are used to paralyse their prey; usually small fish and crustaceans.

They're rarely deadly to people - but their stings will certainly leave a mark!

Just like jellyfish, however, Portuguese man o'war are becoming more common in the UK.

Their species numbers increased by two percent from 2021 in the UK - and is expected to keep rising.

Orca whales

Most people associated orca whales with the chilly waters surrounding the Arctic or Scandinavia - but they're more recently being found in Scotland.

It's never been unusual to see an orca around the Scottish coastline - but it certainly is unusual to see them in their current numbers.

They've also been found in the English Channel, the Irish Sea, and even around the Cornish Isles of Scilly.

It's believed they're following their natural prey - mackerel and herring - as they migrate further south, and fishermen seeing more every year.

The University of Aberdeen's PhD student Andy Foote said: """"That sort of sighting does seem to be on the increase. The killer whales shift their migration and distribution quite drastically.

""Fish like herring and mackerel seem to be doing pretty well at the moment, and it makes sense for the killer whales to follow them.""

Pulp Fiction filmmaker Quentin Tarantino allegedly 'paid $10k to lick a woman's feet', which comes as the iconic director has long been accused of having a foot fetish

Quentin Tarantino allegedly ""paid over $10,000 to lick a woman's feet"" until they ""looked like prunes"", it has been reported.

It has long been speculated that the Pulp Fiction filmmaker, 60, has a foot fetish after a number of close-up shots of women's feet crop up in some of his most famous movies.

And now a senior staffer at a club has claimed that he witnessed a woman getting paid a staggering five-figure sum to have their feet licked by the Oscar winner.

Lowlife (AKA Page Rad), who currently works at Crazy Girls in Hollywood, has claimed the filmmaker, who has two children with wife Daniella Pick, requested a VIP room - in an undisclosed location.

Speaking on the Get in the Car podcast, Lowlife explained that Quentin wanted a dancer with the ""biggest t**s"" and ""biggest a**"" to join him in the room, with Lowlife not disclosing when or where it took place.

The staffer then claimed how he watched Quentin and the unidentified woman on a CCTV monitor.

""He's sitting down, she's about to do her little""¦ take her top off,"" Lowlife said.

""And he gets up, throws her on the f***ing seat, takes her boots off one by one, both shoes, just starts licking the bottoms of her feet, sucking toes.""

This is said to have gone on for around 30 minutes, according to Lowlife.

Speaking about what the woman's feet looked like after the alleged toe sucking, he likened them to a fruit when he explained that they looked ""like""¦ you know when you take a bubble bath? Like prunes.""

Revealing how much money Quentin allegedly paid the woman, Lowlife revealed: ""I think he gave her 10 Gs.""

Mirror US reached out to Quentin's representatives for comment.

Quentin Tarantino movies often feature a scene containing feet, with them popping up Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, as well as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

With close-up shots of women's feet cropping up in his films, he has long been accused of having a foot fetish.

Addressing his alleged foot fetish in an interview with GQ, Quentin previously said: ""I don't take it seriously,"" adding that it's ""just good direction"".

Speaking to the magazine in 2021, he added: ""There's a lot of feet in a lot of good directors' movies. Before me, the person foot fetishism was defined by was Luis BuÃ±uel, another film director. And Hitchcock was accused of it and Sofia Coppola has been accused of it.""

Robert Card, 40, was found dead with self-inflicted gun wounds on Friday evening, more than 48 hours after he committed a mass shooting which killed 18 people and injured 22

The body of mass shooter Robert Card who gunned 18 people enjoying their evening was found putting an end to a terrifying 48 hour manhunt.

After killing 18 people and injuring another 13 in Lewiston, Maine, on Wednesday night, the army reservist disappeared with authorities mobilising hundreds of officers to try and find him. Three cities, including Lewiston, Lisbon and Bowdoin, were locked down with police having no idea where he was.

His body was found at 7.45pm on Friday at a nearby recycling centre near to where his car was found abandoned. He was found in an unlocked trailer in the overflow car park of the recycling centre. He was still wearing the same sweater he wore during the shooting. Despite the manhunt now being over, many questions are still left unanswered.

READ MORE: Maine shooter Robert Card's ex-wife and son 'were in hiding' with guns 'under lock and key'

What was his motive?

Robert Card, 40, was armed with an assault rifle when he walked into the bowling alley, where a children's party was taking place, and opened fire. He then drove to a bar ten minutes away and started shooting there as well.

But what could drive a man with no apparent criminal record to massacre all those people.

Many hoped a note written to his son would shed some light on his motive, but instead Card was revealing the passcode of his phone, along with bank account numbers. It wasn't an ""explicit suicide note"" but instead the note insinuated Card was going to take his own life.

Department of Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck said this is ""not uncommon in a suicide situation."" He added: ""Clearly a mental health component to this."" Police say they believe he bought the weapons used legally.

Card's mental health is under much scrutiny since the shooting. Mr Sauschuck said: ""The individual felt people were talking about him. That he was hearing voices."" But he also pointed out that millions of people suffer mental health issues without hurting anyone.

Card's family were very cooperative with authorities looking for the shooter. Card's devastated sister-in-law, Katie O'Neill, told how his mental health spiralled in recent weeks.

She told how they had tried to get help for her brother-in-law but failed as she revealed he may have targeted a bar and bowling alley on Wednesday evening, knowing his friends may have been inside. ""I have known Rob my whole life,"" O'Neill said. ""He is quiet but the most loving, hardworking, and kind person that I know. But in the past year, he had an acute episode of mental health, and it's been a struggle.""

How he evaded police for 48 hours

Despite police from across Maine, other states and even Canada mobilising in the hunt for Card, he wasn't found for 48 hours.

His body was found near to where his car was dumped in the back of a large trailer used by the recycling plant. Police teams had already searched the centre, twice before eventually finding Card's body, authorities said Saturday.

Department of Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck said the teams that scoured the Maine Recycling Corp. property, including a tactical team, on Thursday night. He said another state police team returned to the site Friday and found Robert Card's body in a location that hadn't been searched.

So many have been left asking how police missed the spot in the first two searches. Or if Card was hiding and doubled back to where he took his own life.

How long was he planning the attack

The attacks happened so quickly in locations kilometres apart, that many were left thinking there could be two shooters.

Card's vehicle was later found by a nearby river and he was discovered to be a boat owner. This led the coastguard to be scrambled. It all seemed very well planned. He had even left a note for his son. Investigators will be trying to discover how long he was planning the attack for.

Did authorities miss a chance to stop the attack

Concerns for Card's mental health were raised long before the massacre. His family said he was hearing voices that were mocking him.

Two senior law enforcement officials also said the gunman's commanders in the army reserve sent him to receive psychiatric treatment over the summer over threats he made to the base.

Despite all this he could buy an assault rifle in the days before the killings. Many have been left asking if crucial moments to intervene were missed.

How long was he dead before police found him

Although found on Friday night, it will take until the autopsy comes back to figure out how long Card was lying there dead before police discovered the body.

Once that is figured out, questions will be asked about if police missed out on bringing the terrifying 48 hour manhunt to an end sooner.

Were the businesses targeted

In between the bowling alley and the bar hit by Card, there are countless other places that could have been targeted. The precision of the two massacres has left many wondering if the evil gunman had chosen these businesses for a reason.

Police will be desperately trying to figure this out.

Will anything change in the US?

Anyone who follows US news will know that massacres like this one are far from rare. In the wake of such atrocities, lawmakers often try to introduce gun control to prevent wannabe killers having access to such high powered weaponry.

Barely four years before Card's massacre the governor signed a law aimed at preventing a mass shooting like this one.

It was called a ""yellow flag"" law, different from the ""red flag"" laws cropping up in other states to seize weapons from gun owners viewed as a threat. In a sign of the pro-Second Amendment mindset in Maine, a gun-rights group helped write the law, and critics said that, while it was a first step toward stronger gun safety measures, the state could save more lives by doing more ""” like passing a red flag law.

But the killing happened none-the-less. What will it take for legislators to put a stop to mass shootings?

The Publican Awards will announce which of the country's firms serve the best drinks, have the best new single pub and offers the best rooms at the final at the end of March

The best pub chains serving up pints and delicious meals across the UK have been shortlisted ahead of the finals.

The Publican Awards pit the best pub companies in the UK against one another across a number of categories, such as the places which serve the best drinks, offer the greatest meals, and provide the best in-house accommodation.

The awards are just one of a number putting the country's best to the test, and come hot off the back of the Rate Good Roasts.

Judges for the competition spent 2022 working out which British pub was serving the best plate of Yorkshire puddings, vegetables and meat, and then plotted the results on an interactive map.

A top 10 list for 2022 was released featuring the likes of The Nags Head in Haughton, Cheshire and London's Blacklock in Soho.

Blog Rate Good Roasts put together the online map, with good roasts cropping up from York to Liverpool and Bristol to Worthing.

Below is the shortlist for the 2023 Publican Awards:

Best New Site

To be up for this gong, the pub must have opened during the past 24 months and be either a new-build pub or a substantial re-development.

This category is one for the pub aficionados out there who like to try out something a little new and be up to date with the current trends in the world of pubs.

Best Brewing Pub Company

To qualify for this section, the pub company had to have between two and 150 sites which manage to juggle both a pub estate and a successful brewery.

Best Community Pub Operator

This category has been created to essentially determine which is the best local in the country, serving up the most pints in the local area to its loyal following.

Best Accommodation Operator

This award will be presented to the company coming out top for excellent rooms, perhaps after a long walk in the countryside or following one too many beers.

Best Drinks Offer

Arguably the most important category of them all - which pub firm is serving up the best pints and glasses of vino.

Best Food Offer

Pub companies which sell a two course meal (Starter/Dessert and Main) from between £12.50 to £25 per head can enter the award, which are looking to find out where serves the best pub grub in the country.

Best Late Night Operator

A category for the kind of pub which specialises in only ringing for last orders late into the night and can convince its punters to stay long after midnight.

Best Sustainable Pub Company

An award for the firm which best demonstrates a significant and concerted effort to reduce its waste and be as green as possible.

All of the categories and finalists can be found on the Publican Awards website.

People around the world rely on rivers for their freshwater to drink and wash in but many of the biggest across the planet are polluted beyond the point of human consumption

Rivers around the world are people's lifeblood, as they provide freshwater and food for people to fish - but many of the world's biggest are unfit for humans.

Pollution, both manmade and natural, fills the waters of several of the world's largest waterways and their conservation is vital for the planet. Delicate ecosystems could be destroyed for good if action is not taken to rid them of horrors. Many have been polluted by the very people who rely on them most, with untreated human waste flowing through the water many have to drink.

In some places the issue has been caused by the huge increase of the human population, while others have been damaged by toxic waste leaked from industrialisation. Below are five of the most polluted rivers across the world.

The Ganges

The third largest in the world is believed to be the most polluted river in the world. Sacred to the people of India, it is believed to cleanse the people of the sins and used by two billion people who wash and drink the water on its 2,525 km length.

However, it is believed more than one billion gallons of raw sewage and industrial waste is unleashed into the river every day, bringing disease and possible death. It is known to cause illnesses including dysentery, cholera, hepatitis and severe diarrhoea which is one of the main causes of death of children in India.

Yellow River

The Yellow River, or the ai-Huaih Yellow River, in China the sixth longest in the world and known for its distinctive colouring caused by its colourful sediment. Its water is toxic and home to industrial waste from the likes of chemical factories. Research has shown more than 80% of the river is polluted.

Doce River

The Doce River flows though southeastern Brazil and was once a source of freshwater for millions of people. However, in 2015 two dams ruptured and contaminated its 853km length with 50 million tons of iron ore sludge and mud. The ecological disaster killed 19 people as well as polluting the river and devastated the wildlife. Many people relied on the river for their livelihoods as they fished and used its water to grow crops - which has now been lost.

Citarum River

The Citarum flows through Indonesia and serves a huge population. Along its banks are 2,000 factories and industrial waste has increased its mercury levels beyond the point of human consumption. Its waters are full of the likes of lead, mercury, arsenic, and other toxins. A project known as Citarum Repair is attempting to clean and restore the river by 2025.

Mississippi River

The Mississippi River is one of the longest rivers in the world at 3,766km and brown in colour because of the sheer amount of waste released into it. Several oil spill disasters have also occurred over the years, causing yet more issues on the waters.

Joe Thompson weighed 19 stone when he was told to get off the Colossus ride at Thorpe Park. The 35-year-old man has now lost five stone and eight inches off his 40-inch waist

A man has said he was inspired to lose weight after being told to get off a rollercoaster at Thorpe Park as he was ""too big"" to ride on it.

Joe Thompson, 35, lost five stone and eight inches off his 40-inch waist. after making a drastic lifestyle change.

The former yo-yo dieter weighed 19 stone when he was told to get off the Colossus ride at the theme Park in Surrey as the safety harness wouldn't close around his belly.

Mr Thompson said he had to get off the rollercoaster and walk past a queue of people, which initially made him feel ""completely mortified"" - but then motivated him to lose weight.

He said: ""I couldn't fasten the safety harness on the Colossus ride. I had to get off and walk past a queue of people, who I'm sure all knew exactly why I couldn't ride.

""I tried to brush it off, but inside I was completely mortified.""

His motivation pushed him to swap a bacon and sausage bap breakfast for poached eggs on wholemeal bread and instant noodles for lunch with a healthy veg soup.

Joe also replaced his sedentary lifestyle, made worse by gout, by going on long walks with a 30kg weighted vest to keep off the pounds.

Gout is a type of arthritis that causes sudden, severe joint pain, explains the NHS.

Getting to a healthy weight and eating a balanced diet can help manage the condition.

Before his diet Joe's chronic gout meant he suffered from ""flare-ups"" every month and on some days he couldn't even walk.

But now, Joe has been dubbed Slimming World's 2023 Mr Sleek after joining the Woodford Green group in London to help him with his weight loss challenge.

He understood he needed to lose weight after seeing photos from back-to-back weddings he had attended in the summer of 2021.

He had taken to using photo editing apps to create the illusion of a slimmer man.

Joe said: ""I really hated having photographs taken by other people.

""I'd become quite good at angling the camera so I looked slimmer or cropping out my body so you wouldn't notice my weight as much.

""So, when the photos came back from my friends' weddings, I was shocked. I couldn't believe it was me in the pictures and I just felt terrible.""

He joined Slimming World weeks later in November 2021, saying: ""I struggled with my weight for most of my life. I was adopted at birth, so I found it hard looking different to the rest of my family - I convinced myself that I had the ""˜fat gene'.

""Leaving home for university meant I was away from my mum's healthy cooking, relying heavily on takeaways and drinking more than I ever had before.

""During this time, I was also figuring out my sexuality and realised I wasn't straight. I struggled to come to terms with this and sought comfort in food.""

Joe had tried cutting carbs for years which he found too restrictive, making him ""miserable"", whilst calorie counting caused panic as he ran out of calories and went to bed hungry.

He continued: ""With Slimming World that never happens because there's always something substantial to eat when you are hungry.

""I love that the plan allows me to eat to satisfy my appetite. It was totally revolutionary for me.""

He is now inspiring others by documenting his journey on social media. Follow him on Instagram at @joeyjoejoe__sw

Joe's daily menu before his diet

Breakfast: Bacon and sausage sandwich with butter and ketchup

Mid-morning: Tube of crisps

Lunch: Pack of instant noodles topped with extra cheese

Dinner: A takeaway such as Chinese, Indian or pizza

Snacks: Chocolate, sweets, crisps, white toast with butter

His daily menu now

The property is located somewhere in Central Kansas and whoever purchases it will become one of a handful of people on the planet to know its exact whereabouts

An abandoned Cold War missile silo dubbed the ""safest home on Earth"" has been listed on the US property market - but it'll set you back a cool $1.3 million.

The unorthodox home has an element of mystery, however, as its exact location appears to be a closely-guarded secret. The underground chamber, which was built in the 1960s, was designed to protect US weapons during tensions with the Soviet Union and is therefore able to withstand a nuclear blast.

The bunker can also endure 500mph winds and has the ability to protect its occupiers from any man-made or natural disaster. The structure cost a staggering $150 million to build, so prospective buyers are in for a real bargain should they be willing to move to its location, which is somewhere in central Kansas.

Part of the Rolling Hills Missile Silo devised by the US government in 1960, its new owner will become of one just handful of people on the planet to know its true whereabouts. The indestructible home features two control rooms, which engineering scientists designed for each silo to house a huge missile.

These rooms sit behind two 7,000lb steel doors built to survive any blast and also feature an underground tunnel. One of the rooms, which is much bigger than the other was once deemed one of the most important in the United States.

All that's visible from the ground, meanwhile is a simple steel door, akin to The Nina Project - a hidden bunker featured in sci-fi drama series, Stranger Things. Now, the silo has endless possibilities for would-be owners as it hasn't been in use for decades.

Suggestions for its new use include a themed hotel, training camp, private meeting space - or of course a home. And with 18 stories of space, its new owner could soon recoup their expenditure should they opt for commercial use. The property also includes enough above-ground space for a helipad or a small garden. The Rolling Hills Missile Silo is listed on its own website - www.rollinghillsmissilesilo.com

It follows the listing of a self-sustaining apocalypse bunker in August for a much more affordable $299,900. Nestled in the rolling hills of Mountain Grove, Missouri, just an hour outside of Springfield, the custom-built underground property is the ideal place to hunker down and wait out whatever disaster is going on above.

Boasting complete self-sustainability, the three-bedroom home includes two bathrooms, a fully-functional kitchen with a gas oven and stove top, dining area, laundry room and a pantry. There is also central heating and a fresh air intake.

The bunker was designed to be inviting, comfortable and warm - rather than cold, concrete and military. It even has a full-size shower and bathtub as well as regular toilets, instead of composting toilets.

And it's not exactly a small space, spanning 1,250ft it should help with feelings of claustrophobia. The bunker includes a 500-gallon liquid propane gas tank, an 80-foot tall antenna tower and a 24/7 surveillance system with a gate - making it pretty self-sustainable.

The entire property is fenced in, meaning any unwelcome visitors would be faced with a barrier, which could easily be reinforced if we were in an apocalyptic setting. Surveillance cameras would also make it easy to keep an eye on your bunker, spotting intruders before they could invade your safe haven.

It lies on 2.4 acres of land with its own orchard trees ready to bear fruit, and a spring-fed creek for fresh water and plenty of gardening areas. It means there's plenty of room to plant your own crops to help make life in the bunker even more sustainable.

Grandfather Giacomo Chiapparini, 74, was found crushed to death in his factory after a shelf collapsed and sent 15,000 wheels of cheese falling to the floor

An Italian dairy farmer was crushed to death when 15,000 large wheels of cheese suddenly collapsed and buried him in his factory.

Giacomo Chiapparini is believed to have been using a machine to rotate the Grana Padano in the huge 21,500-square-foot storage space when a metal shelf suddenly collapsed. Firefighters were called to his farm in Lombardy and, after sorting through the cheese for nearly 12 hours, discovered the father of two dead.

The collapse of a shelf is said to have caused a domino effect, leading to the disaster. Each wheel of cheese can weigh up to 40kg.

Nearly 120 rescuers joined the effort to find the 74-year-old cheesemaker and searched through the night before the grisly discovery was made.

One neighbour told Italian news outlet Il Giorno : ""We heard like thunder and shortly after the firefighters arrived.""

Neighbour Milena added: ""He was a hard worker, he built himself from scratch and already 20 years ago he had to suffer the tragedy of losing a child

""From nothing he had built a large family-run business that exports throughout Italy where, in addition to cheese, there is also a butcher's shop.

""If there was a problem, together with his family she was always very supportive, he gave work to many people, he was a very generous person.""

Bortolo Ghislotti, president of the local agricultural district, added the farmer's family is now in a race against time to save the wheels of cheese and move them to a climate-controlled warehouse before they go to waste.

He added: ""The family, his wife Angela and their two children cannot understand what happened.

""But now we are looking for some colleagues willing to keep all the forms , more than a thousand, which otherwise would have to be thrown away.""

Efforts to remove the remaining cheese are being hampered owing to fears more shelves could buckle and collapse at any moment.

Earlier this year it was reported a man who is "" addicted "" to cheese has spent more than £60,000 on cheddar over the years and manages to get through at least two blocks a day.

Mark King, 54, will put an entire block of cheese into a sandwich and would happily eat four a day if his wife, 49-year-old Tracey, would let him.

But despite this, they claim doctors insist Mark, a woodyard worker from Maidstone, Kent, is perfectly healthy - and the dad of four even boasts a six-pack after 'acclimatising' to the dairy product.

Location Location Location star Phil Spencer was left devastated back in August when his beloved dad Richard, 89, and mum Anne, 82, died when their car careered into a river

An inquest has opened into death of TV presenter Phil Spencer' s beloved dad Richard David Edward Spencer, 89, who died on August 18 2023 at Queen Elizabeth Queen Mother hospital in Margate, Kent.

Richard died from a lung injury after his car overturned in a river, a coroner has said. The farmer was rushed to hospital after he nearly drowned, but he never regained consciousness, the inquest heard.

In August, Location Location Location star Phil's parents were killed in a car crash after a tragic accident on the family farm saw them career into a river. The TV presenter's dad Richard, 89, and mum Anne, 82, died when their car careered into a river. They were on their way to a pub for lunch when their car veered off the access road into a shallow tributary river running through their estate in Littlebourne, near Canterbury, Kent.

At the time, emergency services attended the scene, including an air ambulance. Richard and Anne were pulled from the car and taken to hospital. Sadly Richard was pronounced dead and Anne died later. A woman, in her 60s now revealed by Phil to be a carer for the couple, was also in the car and suffered minor injuries.

At Maidstone County Hall on Monday, Sarah Clarke opened the inquest into the death of Richard David Edward Spencer and said he died of aspiration pneumonitis, which is a lung injury.

Mr Spencer and his wife Anne Spencer both died after the crash as they were on their way to lunch on August 18, 2023, Phil Spencer previously said.

Ms Clarke said at around 12.20pm on August 18, Mrs Spencer was driving her Toyota car with Mr Spencer in the front passenger seat, and their full-time live-in carer sitting in the rear of the car.

They drove from their house towards a river and as their vehicle approached the bridge, it tipped over the edge and overturned, Ms Clarke said.

The trio were submerged in around three feet of water, she added. Paramedics arrived at around 12.57pm and took Mr Spencer and Mrs Spencer to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother hospital in Margate.

Phil remained silent online as the tragic news of his parents' passing broke. However, a week later, he took to his Instagram page to share a sweet photo of the pair as he paid a heartbreaking tribute to his beloved parents while candidly sharing further details of the tragic accident.

The emotive photo of Phil's late parents showed his beloved mother and father matching in blue striped tops as his mum Anne and dad Richard posed behind a half-opened stable door and smiled at the lens. The lengthy and heartfelt tribute in the caption began: ""Very sadly both of my amazing parents died on Friday. As a family we are all trying to hold onto the fact Mum and Dad went together and that neither will ever have to mourn the loss of the other one. Which is a blessing in itself.""

Phil explained his mum and dad had been on ""extremely good form"" before the tragic accident - despite his mum Parkinson's diagnosis while his dad had dementia. In a poignant and tear jerking comment, Phil said how his mother had commented the week before their death that they will ""probably go together"".

He wrote: ""Although they were both on extremely good form in the days before (hence the sudden idea to go out to lunch), Mums Parkinson's and Dads Dementia had been worsening and the long term future was set to be a challenge. So much so that Mum said to me only a week ago that she had resigned to thinking ""now it looks like we will probably go together"". And so they did. That was what God had planned for them - and it was a good plan.""

Phil then shared details of the tragic accident as he said the car had been travelling 'very slowly' but 'toppled over a bridge on the farm drive' and landed 'upside down into the water'. He added how his beloved parents had 'no physical injuries' and said he thinks the pair 'quietly slipped away'.

""The car, going very slowly, toppled over a bridge on the farm drive, upside down into the river. There were no physical injuries and I very much doubt they would have even fought it - they would have held hands under the water and quietly slipped away,"" he said. ""Their carer was in the car and managed to climb out of a back window so the alarm was raised quite quickly.""

Phil added how, after the alarm was raised, his brother, Robert, 'pulled them out of the river' but they were unable to be saved. He said: ""As many farmers do - my brother had a penknife and so was able to cut the seat belts - he pulled them out of the river but they never regained consciousness. Although desperately sad and shocked beyond all belief - all family are clear that if there can ever be such a thing as having a ""good end"" - this was it.""

Speaking of his grief and shock over the heartbreaking incident, he added: ""It feels horrendous right now, but after almost 60 years of marriage - to die together on the farm they so loved will, I know, be a comfort in the future. Mum Dad are together which is precisely where they would have wanted to be.""

Richard and Anne first locked eyes at a New Year's Eve party in Canterbury in the early 1960s and tied the knot at Canterbury Cathedral on November 4, 1964. David studied engineering at Loughborough University, and after working in finance in London for a while, decided to opt for a different life altogether, buying Upper Garrington Farm.

In recent years, Richard was living with dementia, while Anne suffered from mild Parkinson's disease. The couple continued to enjoy village life in their late years, however, and were both dedicated supporters of Littlebourne's St Vincent's Church. David had also been president of Littlebourne Scouts, while Anne had only recently given up her passion for riding horses following a fall.

Former nurse Neil Parker has been living on the land for a year. He says it was 'abandoned' so he started squatting there, but now he's locked in after a bitter dispute with locals

A squatter is locked in a bitter battle with locals after moving into an ""empty"" farm - and now he's been blocked in with rotting silage.

Former nurse Neil Parker describes himself as a 'land pirate' and says he moved onto the farm, which he insists was ""abandoned"", around a year ago.

Since then locals in Ceredigion, Wales, have taken umbrage with Neil - and one farming family have staked a claim on his new home.

Now things are starting to escalate and Neil, in his 60s, says one local has moved his car, caravan and other property and blocked access with 20 bales of raw silage.

What do you think about squatters? Let us know in the comments...

Neil has for years been building a database of hundreds of derelict buildings, mostly in Ceredigion, with no legal owner which he says the public could legally reclaim.

His website reads like a manifesto for squatters and land pirates - and he explains exactly what the public needs to do to take adverse possession of a property.

Neil said: ""My position is very clear. If they have no proof of ownership, then I don't intend to leave. Their interest in this land only seems to have been sparked by my presence.

""In the absence of evidence, they seem to think that force and bullying will achieve the desired result.""

He says he was confronted by a short-tempered farmer days after he took possession of the land.

The owner of a nearby farm told the Cambrian News that Mr Parker had caused 'misery' for her and the village.

And one local has presented a will from 1969 that states the land was left to them by their grandfather.

But Mr Parker says it is not evidence of ownership - and the family hasn't processed the necessary documentation with the Land Registry.

He claims he was subjected to a campaign of intimidation from villagers - with horns being sounded as cars drove by and strangers filming him and abusing him as he worked on the land.

Neil says he had a year of being 'essentially undisturbed' until a local farmer tried to evict him.

Mr Parker said: ""Without any warning, he removed a caravan, car and other property ""” causing criminal damage, and blocked any access with 20 bales of rotten silage.

""The farmer would get irritable very quickly and was obviously very unhappy - and to be fair they think they're being deprived of something, so it's not unreasonable.

""But I make it clear to landowners to go and get legal advice because what I'm doing is well within the law.

""People need land and people need properties and those who own them need to be prepared to do the work and put effort into deriving societal benefit from them.

""The reason the adverse possession statute remains is to allow people to take over bits of land that have been abandoned and for good reason - it's there for a purpose.""

Mr Parker has the eventual goal of clearing the area to plant trees.

According to the Land Registration Act 2002, an unlisted site can fall into someone's possession after 12 years if they can demonstrate they are present and working on the land.

Squatting entails residing on the land.

A member of the family that say they own the farm says she is in the process of registering the land and slammed delays at the Land Registry.­

She said: ""We are extremely disappointed that this individual has inflicted so much unnecessary stress on us as a family, when we are the lawful owners of the land.

""The land was inherited to me from my grandfather and has been part of our family for generations.

""It may be unregistered but the title deeds are firmly within our possession.

""We urge all landowners to be extra vigilant of individuals like Mr Parker, who have no moral conscience and will exploit legal loopholes to gain possession of property which is rightly owned by law-abiding citizens.""

Jeremy Clarkson took to his Instagram page to share a picture of a road sign that was vandalised recently

Jeremy Clarkson revealed a vandal wrote a rude message over a road sign that directed drivers to his Diddly Squat Farm.

The Grand Tour presenter took to his Instagram to share the word the vandal added to the sign. ""Someone's been busy in the night,"" he captioned the post.

Diddly Squat Farm Shop was changed to 'Diddly T*** Farm' at some point during the night.

People found the sign hilarious and took to the comment section to share jokes of their own. ""Council likely commissioned it,"" one user said while another added: ""Council won't find any issues with this.""

Another person quipped: ""It was Hammond getting you back for the speed boat name change.""

""Seems like a more appropriate name,"" one said.

It comes after it was revealed Jeremy will be challenging his local council's decision to refuse plans for him to build a restaurant on his farm.

Clarkson submitted two appeals against the West Oxfordshire District Council decision and will face a key meeting in March to decide the fate of Diddly Squat Farm.

As shown in his hit Amazon Prime show, the council initially refused plans to extend the shop car park and ordered Jeremy, 62, to cease trading in his restaurant.

Clarkson's farm is located in the Cotswold Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty meaning it is subject to tighter planning restrictions.

Officials claim the business ""continued to operate outside the planning permissions granted"" and that ""advice has been ignored"".

So the Top Gear star wrote to the council stating he no longer wished to open a restaurant - but has since had a change of heart.

Despite the endless disputes with his neighbours and the council on his farm, Clarkson's Farm has still been a huge hit with tourists and viewers.

The second season of the Amazon Prime series was one of the most-watched shows on the platform when it came out.

The platform revealed 4.3million viewers watched the second season of the farming reality show, making it Amazon's highest-rated show since the company began reporting viewing figures in November 2021.

The figures for Clarkson's adventures at Diddly Squat Farm even beat The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power which reached 3.2million viewers when it was released last year. The show was also watched by more viewers than Love Island and the Brit Awards.

Sky News panelist Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones MBE said the women's England squad at the World Cup Final was 'not representative' of Britain ahead of the match on Sunday

Sky News has received 192 complaints to the regulator Ofcom over remarks made by panelist Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones MBE about the England women's football team.

In a televised debated, hosted by presenter Kimberley Leonard, about the front pages on Sunday morning Wilfred, who claims to be one of Britain's only black commercial farmers, argued the Lionesses were 'not representative' of Britain.

As Wilfred discussed the front page of the Daily Mirror, which showed a collection of images of the Lionesses with the headline 'Lionesses We Can', he was asked by host Kimberley if he thinks 'we can' win the World Cup.

The British farmer then said: ""This is quite an interesting front cover and I don't want to pour boiling water on it but it isn't that diverse. It really sticks out at you that they're all sort of look blonde, blue eyed.

""If it was the men's World Cup it would be very representative of the Britain we're in - very diverse. So I'm going to be watching it.""

He was then pressed if he meant the image shown or the whole team to which he said: ""The whole team. I'm going to be watching it and I'm going to be supporting it and I don't want to be seen as pouring cold water on but there is something we need to look at.""

Wilfred's comments have since sparked 192 comments to Ofcom while he also received criticism on social media.

One viewer wrote: ""I was amazed and the @skynews anchor didn't even challenge him. The team is white, black, straight and gay. How more diverse should it be? @SkyNews is a bloody disgrace.""

Another added: """"This doesn't represent diverse Britain. It's all these blonde, blue-eyed girls."" What a predictable, miserable, divisive comment - made on Sky News, of course."" And a third wrote: ""It's disappointing but predictable to see comments like this about the Women's England team. Could it not be possible that the best have been chosen? Other countries have football teams with similar levels of diversity but aren't criticised for it.""

Following the TV appearance, Wilfred posted a video on his social media channel in which he discussed making ""mistakes"" but didn't address the backlash directly.

Wilfred said: ""How do you know whether you're living your life to a max? There's a very, very simple measurement; the number of mistakes that you make.

""If you are living a life thinking the whole purpose in life is not to make mistakes you're absolutely wrong. The only way to know whether you're living life to the full is by the number of mistakes you make because mistakes are the great teacher in life. But, make sure that you actually learn from those mistakes.""

A devastating fire ripped through The Crooked House in Himley, near Dudley, last Saturday, and just 48 hours later there was a total demolition of the landmark pub.

A businesswoman who is claimed to have bought the ""UK's wonkiest pub"" is reportedly married to a former director of a firm which allegedly rowed with the brewery over access.

A fire ripped through The Crooked House in Himley, near Dudley, last Saturday, and just 48 hours later there was a total demolition of the landmark pub. Police have now confirmed that it is being investigated for arson.

South Staffordshire Council had said it was probing potential breaches of the law as its officers carried out a site visit but had not agreed to ""the demolition of the whole structure"" or deemed that it was necessary. The fire last Saturday completely gutted the 18th century pub, two weeks after it was sold by brewer Marston's.

According to the Daily Mail the pub was sold to Carly Taylor, 34, and reportedly the director of ATE Farms Ltd who bought the building which had been listed for sale at £675,000.

The Crooked House, which was famously lopsided as a result of quarry work nearby, had stood at the site for 258 years and its loss has attracted anger in the local community and further afield. And it has been claimed that Ms Taylor's husband Adam Taylor is a reported shareholder and former director of Himley Environmental Ltd that has a landfill site next to the pub.

It is claimed that the buying of the pub was ""all about access"" and that there had been disagreements between the company and Marston's over the use of a road to the pub that was shared, Daily Mail reports.

Mr Taylor is reportedly a former director of ATE Farms Ltd, and he is now claimed to be the director at A T Contracting and Plant Hire Ltd which has a correspondence address at Ate Farms. His wife was reportedly a former director at A T Contracting and Plant Hire Ltd.

Staffordshire Police earlier this week told The Times that officers would be ""speaking to the owners"" of the pub in a joint investigation that also involves the fire service and South Staffordshire District Council. Meanwhile, police have been pictured at The Crooked House ruins this afternoon - as they investigate what happened to the pub.

The force said on Wednesday evening that they were now treating the blaze at the pub as arson. It stated: ""This fire has shocked and upset so many given the, albeit not listed, cultural importance and heritage of the building.

""This is not lost on us and a robust investigation using all available information and forensic opportunities is being carried out. We have spoken to, and continue to engage, with the owners. However, speculation is extremely unhelpful and could hinder our investigation.""

In a statement on Tuesday, Chief Inspector Chris Cotton, reported BirminghamLive, said: ""We understand the strength of feeling in the community is high at this moment and the sadness felt amongst those who have a strong emotional attachment to this place. We recognise the cultural heritage and significance of the building within communities in the area and we understand that people are concerned about what happened over the last few days.

""I'd like to reiterate that speculation into the cause of the fire is not helpful at this time. Officers have been working hard to examine all of the evidence available and continue to speak to members of the public who have been forthcoming with information which can help our investigation.

""A cordon was in place temporarily whilst we carried out enquiries at the scene, but, due to the unsafe structure of the building, officers were pulled back and the scene was stood down. Since then, the area has been in the care of the landowners and the building has since been demolished.

""We are progressing a number of lines of enquiry alongside South Staffordshire Council and continue to ask anyone with any information to get in touch with us as soon as possible. We understand that the community have a vested interest in this incident. We are doing everything we can to progress our lines of enquiry and review the evidence available to progress the investigation.""

The PS Plus November 2023 titles will be arriving on Tuesday, November 7, which means the announcement will be a little later than usual.

PS Plus games for any given month are typically announced on the last Wednesday of the month prior; however that won't be the case for the PS Plus November 2023 games.

The PS Plus November 2023 Essential games aren't being announced this week, despite the final Wednesday of the month typically being when the fresh batch of titles for the following month are revealed. But don't worry, it's still coming. Basically, since PS Plus Essential games are released on the first Tuesday of a given month, the actual reveal date is the week prior - usually on the last Wednesday of that month.

November 7 is the first Tuesday of the month, which means that means the PS Plus November 2023 games for the Essential tier will be revealed one week earlier. In this instance, because of how the days fall, that'll be Wednesday, November 1.

While the PS Plus November 2023 games are being bumped by a week, the good news is that you'll have some extra time to pick up the PS Plus October 2023 Essential games which includes horror title The Callisto Protocol, the supernatural Wild West RPG, Weird West, and Farming Simulator 22, which probably has something to be scared of in there for some of you.

If the extra wait for the PS Plus November 2023 Essential games is too much for you, you can always check out the PS Plus Extra and Premium October 2023 games. Some of the offerings this month include Disco Elysium - The Final Cut, which is one of the most highly acclaimed RPGs in recent memory; or if that's not your vibe there's the Batman's pals simulator Gotham Knights (although you're probably better off looking at Marvel's Spider-Man 2 for your superhero fix this month.

PS Plus October 2023 Games

As a reminder, here's everything included in the PS Plus October 2023 games lineup by tier:

You'll need to pick these titles up before Tuesday, November 7, when the PS Plus November 2023 games will take their place.

Four teenagers from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, Jevon Hirst, 16, Harvey Owen, 17, Wilf Fitchett, 17, and Hugo Morris, 18, travelled to Eryri (Snowdonia) National Park for a camping trip but tragically never returned home

The owner of a farm where four teenagers tragically died in a car crash described the ""brutal"" conditions that saw them leave the road and smash into a water-filled ditch.

Farmer Rhys Williams lives at Garreg Hyll Drem Farm, just 25 metres from the ditch where four bodies were found at 10am on November 21, earlier this week. Jevon Hirst, 16, Harvey Owen, 17, Wilf Fitchett, 17, and Hugo Morris, 18, all studied at the same college and lived in Shrewsbury, Shropshire.

They had headed out on a camping trip in the picturesque Eryri (Snowdonia) National Park, but failed to return home, leaving loved ones raising the alarm. This led to a desperate manhunt as family and friends feared the worst before a passing binman spotted the silver Ford Fiesta they had been travelling in.

Mr Williams described the ""brutal"" conditions the teenagers were driving through when they went missing and their car plunged off a windy country road and overturned in a flooded ditch. It is not known when the fatal accident took place. Mr Williams said they were ""so unlucky"" to have left the road on a sharp bend, flipping their vehicle into a ditch that was flooded by two days of rain.

He told The Mirror: ""It was brutal on Sunday. There's always a foot or two of water in the ditch but it can come up to six feet, the level of the car. It was bad on Friday and Saturday, the river had gone high quickly. But by Tuesday morning the level had come down. They were so unlucky. They could have hit a tree or a fence and gone in another way.""

The farmer continued: ""They were found by the recycling lorry at 10 that morning. They were higher up, that's why they could see them. The binman told us they had phoned the police. It is only 25 metres around the corner from here. I could see the car but I didn't see anything else.

""They must have been going from Harlech north towards Snowdonia. This is one of two roads they could have taken. There are no tracks on the road, nothing to be seen. It's a sharp bend, it narrows. There were lots of leaves on that corner. There have been one or two accidents there before.""

The Fiesta was removed from the scene on Tuesday evening. But officers returned to search the area by torchlight on Wednesday morning. Mr Williams explained how at least two buses and possible other cars would have driven past the crash site, none the wiser. He added: ""They were so unlucky, the way the car went in. It has gone into the ditch, low into the ditch. It's a small car. I went past and didn't see anything. Two buses would have gone past before 10am and not seen anything.

""They would have been there all Monday. You have got to be in a high vehicle to see anything and you have got to be looking, a passenger. The driver would have been looking at the road. The binman who saw it said that something caught his eye. He was on his phone and he looked over. You would struggle to see from a car. Some networks have no signal here. EE is good, but Vodafone is not good. On Sunday the water was high.""

After the success of the 'party hole' at LIV Adelaide earlier this year, the Saudi-backed breakaway league is rolling out the idea once again, this time at LIV Chicago

LIV Golf will be rolling out their 'party hole' once more in 2023, after the breakaway league confirmed that the concept would be put into place at their next event at LIV Chicago.

The Saudi-backed series will head to Chicago for the second time this month, after it maintained its spot on the LIV calendar following its appearance in 2022. This time around though there will be a new addition to the setup, with the party hole being made at the par-three 17th at Rich Harvest Farms.

Keen to create an 'electric' atmosphere, LIV's bullish CEO Greg Norman said in a statement: ""Last year, LIV Golf made a splash in the Chicago region when fantastic crowds witnessed Cam Smith's first LIV Golf victory and an impressive team win by the 4Aces.

""This year, we're raising the bar for the area's passionate sports fans. From the party hole to the post-round entertainment, the on-course energy at Rich Harvest Farms will be electric as many of the world's best players battle it out in the race for our individual and team championships.""

This is of course not the first time the breakaway league have added a party hole to one of its setups, following the inclusion of the 'watering hole' at LIV Adelaide earlier this year. Living up to LIV's 'Golf But Louder' motto, the par-three 12th proved to be the highlight of the week at the Grange.



No doubt thanks to Chase Koepka's impressive ace in the event's final round, which led to wild scenes from the fans watching on at the stadium hole. Emulating the PGA Tour's iconic 16th hole at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, Koepka and his playing partners were covered in drinks, as those watching on tossed their bar beverages into the air in celebration.

Discussing the wild reception, Koepka said back in April: ""I started just getting peppered with beer cans. I smelled like beer the whole entire rest of the day. Yeah, it was wild. Crazy experience. I mean, obviously to do it on a hole like that was super special. It definitely gave the fans something to remember...

""No, that's unbelievable. That's a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Yeah, it's something to always remember. Yeah, it's pretty cool. I can just say that. I don't know if I can duplicate what I just did out there, but it'll be really cool coming back here because I know everyone will remember it.""

Similar to the Adelaide design, the par-three in Chicago will include a horseshoe-style stand wrapping right around the green, which stretches all the way down the left-hand side of the hole to the tee box. There is no doubt within the stand a whole host of bar areas will be on offer to those watching the action.

Colin Armstrong, a British millionaire living out in Ecuador, was kidnapped by his home by 15 gangsters before police tracked him down and freed him today, arresting nine men

This is the moment that cops swooped in to rescue a British millionaire who had been kidnapped from his home in Ecuador.

Colin Armstrong, former honorary consul of the United Kingdom in Guayaquil, had been at his home, Rancho Rodeo Grande when 15 gangsters smashed their way in and kidnapped him.

They bundled the Brit into a black BMW he owned and raced away. But Ecuador Police since tracked him down, and freed him, arresting nine men along the way - it isn't clear if the other men believed to have been involved were killed or escaped.

Set to dramatic music, the footage opens on police vehicles racing down a dusty track. It then shows armed officers approaching a bare-brick building, brandishing assault rifles. A number of images flash by, showing the officers outside the brick and gated compound building, then bullets thought to have been recovered from inside.

It then shows various contraband recovered from the site, including a number of guns, drugs, and grenades. The arrested men were then photographed, lined up outside.

The shocking kidnapping sparked a police investigation involving British intelligence services who were assisting in the search. Earlier today Ecuador's police chief, Cesar Augusto Zapata confirmed on X, previously known as Twitter, he had been found, alive and well.

In the update he added nine people had been arrested, although he did not go into detail. He wrote online: ""On the road to ManabÃ­, our units released citizen Collin A., kidnapped days before in LosRÃ­os . At the moment he is safe and healthy. There are 9 arrested. News in development.""

Alongside the update was a picture of the Brit flanked by two officers. His face appeared blurred in the image for an unknown reason and he was dressed in an overlarge jumper and a baseball cap. One person responded to the update: ""We are waiting for you with open arms, dear Colin.""

Mr Armstrong, who is thought to have previously been married to an Ecuadorian woman, has had a long association with the South America country. He founded Agripac in 1972. As well as founding and owning a large agricultural supply company in the South American country, expat Mr Armstrong is a director along with his son of the 500-acre Tupgill Park Estate near Leyburn in North Yorkshire which has been the family home for more than 45 years.

Focus by local authorities previously switched to 78-year-old Mr Armstrong's partner Katherine Paola Santos amid claims made on social media about lies over her identity. Lawyer Ricardo Vanegas claimed in a tweet about the Colombian: ""Following the kidnap of Colin Armstrong, it's become known that Katherine Paola Santos was born in the Colombian city of Barranquilla and began having surgery to look more feminine and that her birth name is Alberto Santos. It appears she is now being investigated by prosecutors and police in Ecuador over the kidnap of Colin Armstrong.""

The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office confirmed: ""We are in contact with -Ecuadorian authorities following the disappearance of a British man and are supporting his family.""

Authorities are considering euthanising all the lions and tigers at the zoo after police shot one lion and one lioness when they were alerted to the death of farmer Jozef at Ranc Pri Ziline farm

A man who owns 16 big cats at his mini zoo in Slovakia has been mauled to death by them, with police only able to find various body parts in their enclosure.

Farmer Jozef died at his home in the town of Kysucke Nove Mesto in the north of the country on Tuesday, May 16.

Authorities are now considering euthanising all the lions and tigers at the zoo after police shot one lion and one lioness when they were alerted to the death at Ranc Pri Ziline farm.

Jozef, the owner of the farm, had obtained permission to breed the wild animals, but the permit expired in 2019 and had not been renewed, according to local media.

He is said to have fed the animals himself on a regular basis.

Alena Krcova, a spokeswoman for the emergency services, said that ""parts of a human body were identified at the scene"".

And Zuzana Sefcikova, a spokeswoman for the Zilina Regional Police, said: ""We received a report that the keeper did not return from the enclosure of exotic animals in the Oskerda district of Kysucky Nove Mesto.

""All available forces and means were immediately sent to the farm for the purpose of properly securing the scene. A man's body was found on the scene, but the exact cause of death will be determined by an autopsy.""

After news of the tragedy spread, locals flocked to the farm, according to local media, with one woman saying: ""We used to come here regularly.

""I saw with my own eyes how he went to the cage and fed the lions.

""I always asked him if he was afraid, and he just said that he had been feeding them since they were babies.""

Another local named only as Peter added: ""He was very arrogant, he didn't know how to behave, he abused the animals and they had very bad conditions.""

Local media reported that the owner repeatedly had run-ins with the law and with animal rights organisations dating back to 2017.

There had also reportedly been other incidents at the zoo, with a 29-year-old woman called Jaroslava being injured when she put her hand into a cage to pet a one-year-old tiger called Diego in 2019.

She survived the incident with injuries to her hand, with the now deceased owner saying at the time: ""We continue to operate and no one is at risk here.

""The lady is not employed here, she is a friend of our employee, who arbitrarily let her into a space where she had no reason to be, and we will solve this matter within the company.""

Diego was spared being put down after Jozef claimed that the tiger was not aggressive.

The Slovakian authorities are now deciding what to do with the remaining animals, with the Agriculture Minister not ruling out euthanising them.

He said: ""If such a tragic situation happens, the carnivorous instinct can usually repeat at different times.""

The minister said that despite the farmer having failed to foster a suitable environment for the wild animals, the State Veterinary and Food Administration was also at fault for neglecting its responsibilities.

The last inspection at the mini zoo, which had reportedly been breeding the animals for years, took place in 2021, with the farmer having been previously fined EUR 2,000 (about £1,700) for unclear reasons.

The investigation is ongoing.

619,"'I went outside on hottest day in history in Sardinia as temperatures hit 45.2C'","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/i-went-outside-hottest-day-30508020","'I went outside on hottest day in history in Sardinia as temperatures hit 45.2C'

As temperatures soar over 45C, residents of the town of Decimomannu stay indoors as the Italian island of Sardinia records its hottest day ever

The sweltering streets are silent - the shops shut, the cafe terrace tables empty and the playground deserted.

As temperatures soar over 45C, residents of the town of Decimomannu stay indoors as the Italian island of Sardinia records its hottest day ever.

The only people outside for any length of time yesterday are the workmen in bright orange gear tarmacking the road in the glaring sunshine.

The top recorded temperature reached 45.2C (113.4C) - smashing the previous record of 42.4C. But in the sun at 4pm I record highs of 48C.

It comes in the week our schools break up and families prepare to fly off for sunshine breaks with perhaps more sunshine than they bargained for.

Brave Mauro Puddu, 34, a psychologist who lives in Decimomannu, has a diagnosis for those venturing outside in this heat.

He says: ""It's only workmen and crazy people that are heading to the gym like me. The gym closes at six so I have to go now. Afterwards I will go home and thankfully I have an aircon in my house.""

Gardener Rafaelle Carboni, 43, is taking refuge in a cafe which has the aircon on full whack, after he and his colleagues impossible to work. Rafaelle explains: ""We worked until 2pm then we returned because it was too hot and we could not stay out given the high temperatures.""

Although he is well used to Sardinia's baking heat, he is shocked by the strength of the sun yesterday.

""It is extraordinary, and it is too much,"" he says. ""This is not at all normal. It just isn't possible to be outside in the open.

""We are now going to wait for the temperature to drop so we can finish the final hours of work before I can go back home where it is cool.""

While he and millions of others across Europe were heeding advice to stay indoors in the hottest hours between noon and 6pm, down by the coast it was an entirely different story.

Although temperatures were already rising to 45C in the lunchtime sun, Poetto Beach in nearby Cagliari was proving very popular. The sand was scorching hot and people cooled off in the clear blue water.

Giovanni Fenu, 47, who grew up nearby but now lives in Cork, Ireland, explains that many workers come down here to bathe on their lunch break.

He is thrilled to be soaking up the Sardinian sun, despite the heat. He said: ""I personally enjoy it. This is the reason I come down every year. It's exactly what I miss in Ireland.""

Jackie Sharpe, 81, and from Chichester, West Sussex, is here on holiday and is not such a big a fan of the weather.

She says: ""It's hard for older people, it's getting a bit too much. This morning I went to a crypt under a church, so that was cool. You've got to find things which are cooler to do.""

Caroline and Darren Henman were also enjoying their holiday under the baking sun, and were just off on a boat trip.

Personal shopper Caroline, 51, from Bedfordshire, said: ""We're going home tomorrow, but we haven't been into Cagliari looking around the town because it is too hot. We've been going out but just stopping and drinking a lot.""

Civil engineer Darren, 53, said: ""We've had to change plans, a little bit less walking. We're going out on a boat now to get some sea breeze.""

Andrea Casti, 35, who runs ice cream shop Casti near the port, says the heatwave is good for business, if not so great for his health, adding: ""We've had to make a lot more ice creams.""

Those hoping for a cooler evening in the city were set to be disappointed as temperatures were expected to still be around 36C at 9pm.

On Monday there was a power cut here for a few hours and local Alberto Rassu, 29, reckons he knows why. ""It was because everyone was running their air conditioning units and it used too much power,"" he says.

But it wasn't just Sardinia suffering. In Rome temperatures were just slightly lower than the 42-43C of Tuesday, while in Italy it hit 46C, with parts of Spain as high as 45C.

The culprit is a high-pressure anticyclone dubbed Cerberus after the multi-headed dog in Greek mythology that guards the gates to the underworld.

Hannah Cloke, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, said: ""The bubble of hot air that has inflated over southern Europe has turned Italy and surrounding countries into a giant pizza oven.""

The latest heat wave added to concerns about climate change. The World Meteorological Organization, a United Nations body, said preliminary global figures showed last month was the hottest June on record.

WMO chief Petteri Taalas said: ""The extreme weather, an increasingly frequent occurrence in our warming climate, is having a major impact on human health, ecosystems, economies, agriculture, energy and water supplies. This underlines the increasing urgency of cutting greenhouse gas emissions as quickly and as deeply as possible.""

Wildfires have broken out due to the extreme temperatures and firefighting aircraft and ground crews from Poland, Romania and Slovakia are on their way to Greece today.

Israel has pledged to send two firefighting planes, adding to the four from Italy and France that were already operating outside Athens.

But as Europe burns, Britain is set to be battered by a whole month's worth of rain this weekend thanks to a ridge of low pressure and the jet stream.

Up to 60mm of rain could fall on Saturday and Sunday, medium-term forecasts indicate.Millions of British families preparing for holidays in countries suffering soaring temperatures have been given tips on how to cope.

The Foreign Office has issued extreme weather warnings for Italy, Spain and Greece, while parts of France, Germany, Poland, Cyprus, Turkey, Croatia and Switzerland are also experiencing record-breaking heat.

Visitors are advised to stay out of the sun where possible, wear high-factor sunscreen, seek shade and inside spaces with air-conditioning, drink plenty of water and cut back on alcohol.

A hand-held fan and a water spray will also help in the blistering conditions. Heat is more intense in cities, so avoid popular spots, especially in the middle of the day. Some tourist attractions have closed so check before travelling.

If you decide that travelling with young children, the elderly, or anyone with a medical condition is too risky and you want to cancel your trip, I'm afraid that extreme temperatures are not covered by holiday insurance policies.

The youngster's body, believed to be between two and three, was found on the sand early this morning in Costa Dorada resort of Roda de Bera, Spain, by a council cleaner

Horrified beachgoers have told how 'headless' body of a child that washed up at a tourist spot was reportedly mistaken for a doll.

The remains of the youngster, thought to be aged between two and three, were discovered on the sand early this morning at a beach in the Costa Dorada resort of Roda de Bera in the east coast province of Tarragona.

A council cleaner made the grim find and alerted his bosses who called police. The body of the child, said to be missing other body parts as well as its head and thought to have been washed onto the beach from the water, is understood to be in a state of decomposition.

Civil Guard officers have cordoned off the area and are moving locals and holidaymakers on to other areas of the sand before an investigating judge authorises the removal of the body.

Roda de Bera mayor Pere Virgili has been quoted in local press as saying the youngster could have been on a migrant boat which capsized in the Mediterranean.

The town hall said in a tweet: ""We inform you that this morning the body of a two to three-year-old child was found on the shoreline on the Costa Dorada beach.

""The area is cordoned off and officials are waiting for the judge to authorise the removal of the body. We ask the public to avoid the area.""

Roda de Bera is a 25-minute drive north of Tarragona. Barcelona is just over an hour's drive north.

The town, well-known thanks to its Roman arch, was mainly dedicated exclusively to agriculture until the second half of the 20th century when it became an important tourist spot on the Costa Dorada.

The Civil Guard, which is investigating, has yet to make any official comment.

The clocks are set to go back this weekend which means winter is well and truly on the way - but it means we will get an extra hour in bed in the colder months

We're approaching that time of year when the clocks change again, which means the dark mornings and evenings are back - and winter is fast approaching.

Every year the clocks move twice - moving us between Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and British Summer Time (BST). As it doesn't happen on the same date every year it will always manage to somehow catch us off guard. It's also confusing to know which way they are turning - but one easy way to remember the change is ""spring forward, fall back,"" meaning we move the clocks forward in the spring, and backwards in the autumn/fall.

When do the clocks change?

The clocks are set to go back on Sunday, October 29, marking the start of earlier sunsets and days getting shorter and the end of BST. Although it's not all bad. It means we also get an extra hour in bed on Sunday morning as we prepare for the colder months. The clock change will always happen at 1am on the last Sunday of the month so there is as little disruption as possible. If you're awake at this time, you will notice instead of the time changing to 2am, it will go back to 1am.

Why do the clocks change?

The change came into play in 1916, as it was introduced to give farmers an extra hour of sunlight to work and help boost the agricultural sector during the First World War. However, people have argued it's outdated and that the UK is much less reliant on the farming economy compared to when it was put in place.

American scientist Benjamin Franklin had first proposed the idea in 1784. He believed that if people got up earlier in the morning, when it was lighter, it would save them having to use so many candles. However, the idea wasn't taken seriously until 1907, when builder William Willett published a pamphlet titled The Waste of Daylight. Willett, who is actually Coldplay Singer Chris Martin's great-great-grandfather, suggested putting the clocks forward in the spring, and back in the autumn.

Some argue the clock change is good for reducing energy consumption, getting people to exercise outdoors and reducing road accidents, although the counterargument for this is that changing the clocks is now useless, given the fact that many people spend time inside their well-lit homes, offices and shops, where the extra bit of daylight doesn't make much different. This argument completely depends on people's geographical location, their job and lifestyle.

How to make the most of the time change and getting the best sleeping pattern

Even though the thought of an extra hour in bed sounds like a dream, it can also wreak havoc on our sleeping pattern. To stop this from happening, it's recommended we start preparing our bodies a few days before the change so it doesn't affect us too much.

Dr Lindsay Browning, psychologist, neuroscientist and sleep expert for And So To Bed, says: ""If you don't alter your bedtime before the clocks change, you may find that you wake up too early and find yourself tossing and turning in bed until your alarm goes off. This can leave you feeling tired during the day, as though you didn't have a good night's sleep.

""To help combat this, and to help you get going in the morning, start the day by opening your curtains wide as soon as you wake up to let in the light. You could even try moving your breakfast, lunch and dinner a little later each day too, since the timing of mealtimes also has an impact on our internal clock. Also, make sure that you leave the house for a mid-morning/lunchtime walk to help you get some important sunlight exposure and a little light exercise.""

She adds: ""Try to avoid caffeine after about 2pm, since caffeine has a six-hour half-life (meaning caffeine is still in your system many hours after your last drink). Lastly, practise good sleep hygiene by avoiding bright lights in the evening from your phone and laptop, as these can disrupt your natural production of melatonin.""

Meghan Markle's former lifestyle blog The Tig boasts an eclectic list of unusual Christmas gifts, as she shared the best presents to exchange with family and friends

Meghan Markle has revealed her top Christmas gift ideas and the list is quite unusual.

Writing on her now-defunct blog, The Tig, the Duchess of Sussex listed six potential presents you could exchange during the festive season, and while some are a no-brainer, others are a quirky choice. For example, Meghan listed Found My Animal Adjustable Rope Leashes for ""socially-minded"" pet owners.

She explained that buying from the pet good company would be ""supporting local animal shelters"" while kitting people out with ""stylishly colorful ombrÃ© leash designs."" Elsewhere on the list, Meghan recommended Conscious Step Crew Socks, an ethically made pair of socks that ""make you feel like every step you're taking is a stride in the right direction,"" adding that the design you choose is aimed at benefiting either a particular cause ""like HIV treatment or hunger prevention.""

The Duchess' mindful gifts expanded into fashion and beauty as she encouraged her readers to purchase jewellery from The Neshama Project, a boutique jewellery line that donates a percentage of all proceeds to a non-profit that seeks to expand solar power, clean water, and agricultural technology to rural villages on the continent. She claimed: ""You're getting a quality product in addition to supporting a worthy cause."" You can expect to spend up to $743 (£588) on the site.

Meghan also listed a Los Angeles-made curated gift box ideal for the ""California dreamer"" and a set of candles that, ""aside from smelling heavenly and being hand-poured right in Brooklyn, NY, these chic candles are also looking to light up the world"" as their founder raised more than $100,000 (£80,000) for the development of solar power systems in Chad, Meghan explained.

Meghan ran her blog for a few years before she met her husband Prince Harry. The Tig was her self-described ""passion project"" and she posted recipes, travel tips, and personal photos of her adventures over the years.

She shut down the blog in 2017 as she started to adjust to the royal life as Harry's fiancÃ©e at the time. It was revealed earlier this year that she might be bringing it back sometime soon as her latest venture.

Meghan's team has reportedly filed for new trademarks for The Tig through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The new Tig uses the same logo Meghan used before but seems to cover more than just travel and cooking tips, according to TMZ.

An inquest into the death of Timothy Southern, from Lichfield, Staffordshire, heard that the 53-year-old died after taking part in a marathon drinking contest at his hotel in Jamaica

A man on holiday in Jamaica died after attempting to drink all 21 cocktails on the hotel pool bar menu, an inquest heard.

Timothy Southern, from Lichfield, Staffordshire, met two Canadian women who had been trying to complete the challenge to mark one of their birthdays and the 53-year-old decided to join them.

He had already drunk beer and brandy in the morning and managed to get through 12 cocktails before going to his room at the Royal Decameron Club Caribbean, in Saint Ann, his inquest heard.

He became sick and later died at the hotel. Now loved-ones have hit out at hotel staff, including a nurse, over how the situation was handled after the alarm was raised.

Timothy was on holiday with his sister, children, and other relatives when the tragedy struck in May, 2022.

The family say they alerted staff when they realised he was seriously ill.

Speaking at his inquest, one of them said: ""He was on his back choking. I put him in the recovery position and screamed for an ambulance. He was making a gurgling sound.

""As soon as he was in the recovery position he vomited. I was shouting his name with no response.

""When the nurse arrived I said had an ambulance been called and she said 'no'. I thought she would take over. But that was not the case. I noticed he was starting to lose temperature. I checked his pulse and couldn't find it.

""She said he had a pulse. I was starting to lose it. I got a full look at his face and I thought he had passed away.

""I said, 'Don't just sit there looking at him, start CPR'. She only gave him chest compressions. Maybe if she had known what she was doing, maybe he would still be here. The service and treatment he received was disgusting.""

A pathologist in Kingston, Jamaica, gave the cause of death as 'acute gastroenteritis due to alcohol consumption'. But the inquest heard toxicology reports could take three years to come back from Jamaica.

Staffordshire area coroner Emma Serrano has ruled the death was alcohol-related.

Customs agents were left gobsmacked after discovering a woman at Futian Port in China had tried to traffic five bags worth of lizards inside her bra

This is the moment customs agents in China seized 16 live lizards hidden inside a female passenger's bra.

The unnamed woman had been attempting to traffic the reptiles into Hong Kong, but was left red-faced after being caught on the Chinese mainland side of the border. Footage shows her shuffling through the customs area at Futian Port wearing incredibly baggy clothes, and was later forced to undergo a strip search after she drew too many suspicions.

As officers took her aside, they discovered she had five mesh bags placed inside her bra which contained 16 rare sail-finned lizards. Video released by the country's customs department shows agents the lizards out of the bags and placing them inside large, plastic containers while waiting for wildlife experts to take over.

The sailfin lizard (Hydrosaurus amboinensis), or sailfin dragon, is a group of large iguana-like reptiles named after the sail-like structure on their tails. Native to Indonesia and the Philippines, they are commonly found living near water and are threatened by both habitat loss and exotic pet trade.

Sizes vary with the largest males growing up to three-and-a-half feet long while the females are smaller. It's not known exactly what gender of reptile was seized.

Last month, customs agents seized 77 seahorses, five snakes and snail ointment from man travelling through a US airport. The male passenger was passing through Washington Dulles International Airport from Vietnam when he was subjected to a secondary bag check when suspicions of its contents were raised by customs agents.

The check, carried out on August 1, revealed the passenger was carrying a particularly bizarre contraband. Items included 77 dried seahorses, dead snakes, and an ointment derived from snails - along with illegal pork products. The man was travelling to a final destination of Fairfax, Virginia.

The import of all items discovered required necessary permits or documentation - of which the man did not have. Additionally, uncertified pork products from Vietnam are prohibited by the U.S. Department of Agriculture due to the potential introduction of the dangerous African swine fever and swine vesicular disease.

A second traveler from Vietnam, who arrived on August 4 and was destined to San Francisco and was found to be carrying four prohibited pork products and 50 small boxes of a commercial herbal liquid medicine that listed its ingredients as snake oil.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle could be on the cusp of a new royal feud as the King and the palace worry about their ongoing close bond with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle could have a new royal feud on the horizon as the King and the palace worry what the couple could find out amid their ongoing close bonds to some of their relatives.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped back as senior working Royals in 2020, with them moving to Montecito, California shortly after their bombshell announcement. Setting up life in America with their son and daughter, Meghan and Harry have kept a distance from the palace - or so it seemed.

But now it has been reported that despite the couple being estranged from their family, they have remained close to two of Harry's relatives, with whom his close bond goes back decades, with them having long been confidants of his too.

According to an insider, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have remained very close to Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice, which has ""left the Royal family worried"" about what palace information the Montecito-based duo could end up hearing, as per Heat Magazine.

The Duke and Duchess are said to have caught up with Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank recently, with reports even claiming they jetted off to Portugal together where they had a ""wonderful time"". It was also revealed that Harry and Meghan are even planning on hosting Eugenie and Jack in California over the holiday season.

""They've got so much in common: the kids, a shared interest in philanthropy, and Harry enjoys offering advice to his cousin about how to further her career, while Meghan's great with parenting, lifestyle, and nutrition,"" the insider spilled.

Eugenie isn't the only relative still close with Prince Harry and Meghan though, because Harry's other cousin Beatrice is quite ""fond"" of the duo, as is her husband Edo. And according to a source, the two sisters have shown ""loyalty and compassion"" to

But this bond is said to be causing a stir inside the palace, with them supposedly ""worried"" that the friendship could lead to a ""new royal feud"". Speaking to the outlet, an insider said: ""For the King, Camilla, and the Waleses, it's rather unfortunate that Eugenie and Beatrice are so close with the Sussexes.""

The insider added that these fears are cropping up because Beatrice and Eugenie are ""still privy to a lot of what's happening inside Buckingham Palace, so there's a concern about what they're telling them, and what they could reveal - even unintentionally"".

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are reportedly in the middle of a ""bitter rift"" with David and Victoria Beckham despite being friendly for years

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have reportedly royally fallen out with their friends David and Victoria Beckham.

Former England football captain David and Harry have known each other for years and worked together on numerous charity events before joining forces in the campaign for London to host the 2012 Olympics. The Beckhams also attended Harry and Meghan's wedding in May 2018.

But after the Duke of Sussex asked David to be an ambassador for the Invictus Games, things reportedly turned sour when Harry refused to see the former England football captain at the event in Sydney in 2018. Now it's being claimed that the reason Harry was keeping his friend at arms' length was Meghan - as she feared Victoria was leaking stories about her to the press.

""Having flown half-way around the world, he was perplexed why officials after he arrived at the sporting venue were playing a dance to keep him happy, but away from Harry,"" royal expert Tom Bower writes for The Sun. ""The reason for the distance was Meghan, the newly married Duchess of Sussex. She wanted no competition in the media from David, and especially not from his wife, Victoria.""

Meghan's visit to Australia for the Invictus Games was her first overseas royal tour after officially becoming the Duchess of Sussex. But Bower claims a ""frisson"" had developed between Meghan and Victoria despite the Duchess wearing Beckham label clothes to several royal occasions afterwards.

Meghan wore a navy blue coat from Victoria's brand on Christmas Day in 2018. Then, in March 2020 Meghan wore a custom-made white coat and dress to Westminster Abbey. Rumours of a rift between the two women started in January 2020 when it was claimed that Meghan became concerned that private details were cropping up in the press that concerned her friendship with Victoria.

Meghan's fears are claimed to have prompted Harry to tackle the rumours ""head on"" and speak to David. ""Harry was very polite, but obviously it was a pretty awkward exchange and David was mortified,"" the source told The Sun. In December 2017, it was reported that Victoria had opened her little black book and given Meghan a list of contacts for her favourite facialists, stylists and hairdressers - details of which later appeared in the press.

Former Suits actress Meghan previously spoke of Victoria in the press and admitted she didn't have the right 'silhouette' to wear designs from the Spice Girl's fashion label. Meghan, who is 5ft 6in, said: ""What I'm starting to learn is, even though things look amazing on the hanger, it doesn't mean they're going to look amazing on me. For example I love Victoria Beckham dresses, but I don't have the long torso to support that silhouette.""

David and Victoria have plenty of friends in high places and two weeks ago they welcomed Kim Kardashian and her children to watch Lionel Messi's debut with Inter Miami. Victoria and Kim were snapped holding hands as Keeping Up With The Kardashians star Kim aided a struggling Victoria to get down from the large stands. The pair were also photographed chatting and giggling towards the end of the game.

The Mirror has contacted Prince Harry and David Beckham's representatives for comment.

HONOR show us their take on the foldable smartphone that is a fraction of the price when compared to Samsung

HONOR Magic Vs

Please note software is not finalised at the time of writing this review therefore details are restricted to only certain hardware elements only.

Chinese tech company HONOR, since getting out of the shadow of its parent brand Huawei has forged its own path with its distinct style that helps set them apart, and nothing makes that clearer than the HONOR Magic Vs.

Foldable phones have become a viable option with screen technology improving so slowly other phone manufacturers are beginning to challenge the Samsungs Galaxy Z Fold line with their own models.

Foldable Phones offer an experience between tablet and phone offering a larger display but the functionality and high performance of a modern smartphone, making them excellent for gaming, productivity and watching films and TV on the go.

The Magic V was HONOR's first foldable phone and was released in China back in January 2022 as a follow-up to their flagship the Magic 4 Pro, this has been updated and tweaked for its Global release as the Honor Magic Vs.

Like most HONOR devices it features a bold, glossy and sleek and symmetrical design that looks premium without looking over the top.

It's available in three colours cyan, orange and black. It's also large, even for a foldable at 160.3 x 72.6 x 12.9mm when folded and 160.3 x 141.5 x 6.1mm when fully opened which feels strange at first but didn't take me long to get used to.

This makes it a bit larger than the Samsung Fold 4 and chunky although it does have a slim and tall profile when folded, which makes it feel a little less clunky which I really liked as a design.

It's a little heavy and takes a little time to get used to at 261g which is more than the iPhone 14 Pro Max, but around the same as the Samsung Fold 4.

The rectangular camera module contains three lenses that do protrude slightly from the device, making it never sit perfectly flat, which did bother me a little.

Unsurprisingly there is no audio jack in sight but, it of course supports Bluetooth 5.2 for connection to wireless earbuds and speakers.



Made with a metal frame and glass front and back the Magic Vs retains that glossy premium look HONOR is known for, and like all glossy, glass phones, it's a fingerprint and smudge magnet unless you confine it to a case.

The magnesium alloy frame and titanium alloy hinge make it feels like an absolutely solid unit. There is no IP rating, so I'd be careful with it around spills, heavy rain and try not to drop it in the bath.

The hinge was one of the better I've felt in a folding phone, feeling sturdy and not too loose or rigid, and HONOR claims its mechanism can withstand up to 400,000 folds or ten years of use and it certainly felt tough enough.

However, the indent is noticeable especially if you run your finger over it while gaming, it didn't bother me but some users may find it offputting.

HONOR says their gearless hinge reduces the number of components of the support structure from 92 to 4, making it lighter and less complicated, with less complicated parts to go wrong.

The screens are one of the highlights of the Magic Vs as they should be in any foldable device. The Magic V features two stunning OLED displays.

Firstly, the exterior is a 6.45-inch screen with a 120Hz refresh rate capable of 2560 x 1080 (431 PPI) and resolution, meaning it's very sharp and clear with a fast smooth refresh rate.

Secondly, the internal display is a 7.9-inch folding OLED display that offers a whopping resolution of 2272 x 1984 but only a 90Hz refresh rate, which is still smooth but baffles me why they didn't make this screen 120Hz as it's the main focus of the device.

The aspect ratio of the outer screen offers a nearly 21:9 aspect ratio which is great for watching films offering minimal, annoying bars in the frame.

Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be any advanced Gorilla Glass protection and while certainly not fragile I would be cautious with the OLED display.

The screens are all HDR10+ certified and can display up to 1.07 billion colours giving them a strong and punchy contrast as well as rich a vibrant colours which look awesome for gaming, watching a film or just browsing the web, however, they are slightly duller than Samsung's which honestly isn't surprising.


Specifications

Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 - 4 nm Octa-core 1x3.0 GHz Cortex-X2 & 3x2.5 GHz Cortex-A710 & 4x1.80 GHz Cortex-A510

Screen: 6.45 inches FHD+ 1080 x 2640 pixels (431 PPI), Internal display 7.9 inches (381 PPI)

RAM: 8GB RAM /12GB RAM

Storage: 256GB / 512GB

That Snapdragon chip ensures swift performance for gaming as well as day-to-day tasks. While it may not be the highest spec with the recent release of the Snapdragon 8 gen 2, it's still incredibly powerful, reducing loading times and keeping up that swift performance.

Gaming on the Magic Vs was a breeze, with everything from Apex Legends, Minecraft and the beast that is, Genshin Impact running at higher settings with just a few screen rate stutters but nothing too distracting.

I had an amazing time gaming on the Magic Vs when I placed it in a mobile phone controller/holder like the Nacon MG-X Pro.

There are two different RAM Options, 8GB and 12GB, both are more than enough for having multiple tabs open, editing video and gaming.


There are also different storage options from 256GB to a whopping 512GB, while there's also no Micro SD slot for expandable memory, there are storage options that will be fine for most users.

The HONOR Magic Vs features a solid three-camera module including a 54MP Sony IMX800 Main Camera, a 50MP Ultra-Wide & Macro Main Camera and a handy 8MP Optical Zoom Camera.

It can record images of up to 6144Ã—8768 pixels making them perfect for large prints or some tight cropping and editing.


This setup seems a great choice as the main camera doubling as a macro works well and a dedicated telephoto camera is the most useful option.


The battery is a 5000mAh cell that charges via USB-C and features 66W Wired HONOR SuperCharge for quick charging but doesn't support wireless charging.

Pricing hasn't yet been confirmed nor has the official release date although it is believed to be around towards the end of February 2023.

Speculation of pricing based on the Chinese listing online points to around £850 for the 8GB / 256GB version and around £1,000 for the 12GB and 512GB storage models, putting it in the flagship territory yet still on the affordable end of that spectrum. While the exact price isn't known it's incredibly likely it will be less than Samsung's Fold 4 which is £1649.

HONOR Magic Vs VERDICT: 4/5

While not the final experience, what I've seen and used so far is very impressive

The Magic Vs is a solid phone with its sleek design and spectacular performance, as well as brilliant screens, making it much more than just an inexpensive alternative to the Samsung Fold, and a great phone in its own right.

It delivers a quality folding phone/near-tablet experience without compromising very much on the way.

Half of French ski slopes have had to close as hot weather fuelled by human caused emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide have pushed the winter temperature up unseasonably high

The ski season is in the midst of a crisis as half of France's slopes have had to close amid record temperatures fuelled by global heating.

Alpine enthusiasts have found themselves on muddy hillside this December and January as rain and sleet combine with warm weather to melt the snow, with resorts in the northern Alps and French Pyrenees affected.

Ski resort Ax 3 Domaines was forced to temporarily close, while the likes of Le Gets and Morzine have only opened a limited number of runs.

""The period immediately after Christmas was the warmest since 1997 in France"", with ""exceptionally high"" temperatures recorded, The Local France reported.

Temperatures around 8C higher than the seasonal average has devastated many of the ski resorts at a lower altitude and made winter sports impossible.

Many skiers have filmed themselves standing on mud as ski lifts trundle overhead.

Austrian ski resorts in the Salzburg region have had no snow for at least a month, while parts of Switzerland are 20C warmer than usual.

After years of warning that temperatures in the resorts were creeping up and making skiing harder and harder, the start of 2023 seems to be the realisation of many people's worst fears.

As the level of carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions continue to increase and global temperatures rapidly rise, the situation is likely to get worse year-on-year.

The worsening conditions in the Alps may lead some winter sports enthusiasts to look elsewhere for a fresh piste.

Need cash? Go to the Post Office



Shopping with cash is on the increase for the first time in a decade - so the next time you need some, head to the Post Office and help raise money for food banks.

For every over-the-counter cash withdrawal at the Post Office between November 6 and March 31, it will give 1p to the Trussell Trust to help tackle poverty and hunger.

Pressure on food banks looks set to soar in 2024 with Ofgem, the independent energy regulator, increasing the energy price cap - further squeezing family budgets.

The Trussell Trust expects one million food parcels to be distributed across its network of 1300 food banks this winter, the most parcels ever provided across this period.

With the Post Office's network size they are uniquely placed to help vulnerable customers navigate these challenging times.

One country which has become increasingly popular in recent years is Bosnia, which is known for offering cut price packages in comparison to France, Italy and Switzerland.

Unfortunately it is also suffering from a difficult winter due to unseasonably hot weather, leading visitors to the country to pack up and go home following New Year's celebrations at its resorts.

Hotel owners say bookings are down, and with them both room prices and staffing levels.

Tourism officials said holiday makers are forced to seek alternatives to skiing, like hiking on grassy mountaintops - or riding ski lifts, just for the views.

""Right now, when we should be welcoming skiers on our mountain, we have no snow so there is no doubt that our business will falter, that is to be expected,"" said Dino Korugic, manager of the Sunce hotel in Vlasic.

""Our bookings correlate strongly with (the) weather forecast.""

Record-high daily temperatures for this time of year have been beaten in recent days at hundreds of weather stations, in at least 10 countries: Bosnia, Belgium, Czechia, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland.

At least five of those - Belgium, Czechia, Latvia, Poland and the Netherlands - set national record daily highs for a December 31 or January 1.

The U.N.'s World Meteorological Organisation has long warned about the ill-effects of climate change, and say the last eight years have been the eight hottest on record.

The fallout this winter hasn't been limited to snowless slopes, where mid-range altitudes have been affected most of all: Weather officials and scientists say flora and fauna are feeling the impact too.

Meteorologist Florian Imbery of Germany's national weather service, DWD, said the temperature anomaly seen over the new year period could trigger unwanted plant growth - exposing crops to greater risk of frost damage later in the winter.

Biologist Livio Rey, spokesman for the Swiss Ornithological Institute, said many ducks that would normally migrate to Switzerland this time of year from Nordic countries don't come anymore, like the tufted duck.

Manchester United spent heavily in the summer but could be set for another huge splurge after an array of suggestions from former Red Devils following an indifferent start to the season

Manchester United could field a stunning side should Erik ten Hag take on some outlandish transfer suggestions from Red Devils' icons.

United have endured a tricky start to the new season under the Dutchman. The side currently sit eighth in the Premier League ahead of Sunday's Manchester derby.

That indifferent start comes after a lucrative summer transfer window that saw Man United spend around £175m. The club could be tempted to enter the market once more to get back on track, with an array of former players already submitting suggestions to the recruitment team.

Take a look at the starting XI Ten Hag could boast should he attempt to seal all of those deals put forward to him:

Starting in goal, Andre Onana looks likely to be the Red Devils' starting goalkeeper going forwards despite a difficult first few months to life at Old Trafford. The former Ajax man has made a number of high-profile errors since his £47m arrival from Inter Milan but looks sure to be the club's first choice for the foreseeable future.

The defence in front of him may however look slightly different. Lisandro Martinez has shone during his time at the club but injury issues keep on cropping up. That could see the Red Devils invest in a number of central defenders.

Iconic former centre-back Rio Ferdinand has already suggested a few potential options. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, he said: ""The boy at Lens, [Danso] there's one there, he's good. The Uruguayan boy at Barcelona - Araujo. Whether he's gettable or not, I think he's brilliant. He's an unreal centre half.

Who do you think Man United should sign in January? Share your suggestions in the comments below

""He has every attribute to be perfect for the Premier League. I'd probably say he's the standout, but whether he's gettable or not, I don't know. I've always said this - to be a successful team, you need that foundation of a solid defence and to be able to pick similar players.""

The pair should be drafted straight into the heart of defence, with Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka flanking them either side. If fellow Red Devil Louis Saha had his way, there would also be changes in midfield.

Casemiro remains one of Ten Hag's most trusted custodians despite the former Real Madrid star's start to the new campaign. He could potentially be partnered in midfield by Newcastle's Bruno Guimaraes.

Speaking out on the Brazilian to Betfred, Saha said: ""He's a great player and I followed him closely during his time in France with Lyon before he made the move to Newcastle.

""This is definitely an option that Manchester United can look at because Bruno is a quality midfielder, but they also need to find midfielders that are best suited to Erik ten Hag's style of play and vision.""

A deal for Guimaraes could be difficult given the fact he only penned a new five-year deal earlier this month. Should the Red Devils pursue him, then the Brazilian would assemble a formidable midfield trio alongside Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes.

Sticking in the Premier League, another of this season's shining lights - Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma - would also be an excellent addition. Saha added: ""I would like to see Mitoma arrive at Old Trafford.

""He's a very exciting player and he never seems to have any doubt of the ball. He'll bombard defences with offensive moves all the time, and I love his energy and the way he plays with a smile

""Mitoma is great to watch, and his attitude would be perfect for any club. Some players think too much, but Mitoma relies on instinct. You can tell he's worked very hard on the training ground to achieve this, and now he's got to a point where he looks like a natural.

TNT Sports gives you access to games across the Premier League, Champions League, Europa League, Serie A and many more. You can also watch the biggest clashes in boxing, UFC, WWE and the get exclusive action from MLB all for one payment every month. You can watch TNT Sports through BT, EE, Sky, and Virgin Media.

""Managers know exactly what they're going to get from Mitoma, and he'd be a strong asset to any club. He'd be very exciting at Manchester United as they tend to have wide players who overthink.""

Mitoma is another to have put pen to paper on fresh terms so a deal could be expensive. The Japanese international, while usually a left-winger, would likely have to be moved to the opposite flank to accommodate Marcus Rashford. Rasmus Hojlund would round off an impressive-looking team - the £72m man leading the line for United.

Man United potential XI: Onana; Shaw, Danso, Araujo, Wan-Bissaka; Casemiro, Guimaraes, Fernandes; Mitmoma, Rashford, Hojlund.

Reviews Editor Stacey Dutton got her hands on the new Ninja Possiblecooker which has tons of functionalities to choose from - but, will it be a worth buy for families looking at keeping costs low this winter?

A slow cooker could possibly be one of the handiest gadgets to get a hold of this season- homely, heartfelt cooking for a family of full bellies. You seriously can't beat it can you?

This is why I made it my mission to get as many recipes under my belt before the arrival of my brand spanking new Ninja PossibleCooker. It's a great addition to my kitchen, while using the Ninja Speedi is great for our quick meal needs as a family, this new model has been created for families looking to prep meals in the morning for a delicious meal in the evening.

Unlike traditional slow cookers which only use side heating elements, the PossibleCooker has Triple Fusion Heat which combines heating elements in the sides and base with steam heat to unlock even more cooking options - so you can also sear, sautÃ© and simmer hearty meals to share, just like you would on the hob.

This versatile worktop appliance replaces multiple cooking tools as you can use it as a non-stick pot, sautÃ© pan, cast iron skillet, steamer, saucepan, hob, slow cooker, stock pot, casserole dish, roasting pan, bread maker and food warm. The 8L capacity is perfect for cooking up to 8 portions which is great for feeding a crowd or batch-cooking food to freeze.

The first dish I made in my slowcooker is a chicken casserole- easy ingredients rally up and plenty of goodness for our family of four (whether they like it or not). Incredibly, before I go into the method of cooking this dish, it has to be noted how affordable I believe this model is- it's RRP is just £149.99.

For any gadget you are willing to invest in during harder financial times when trying to keep cost's low- it's so important to always consider if you are going to use it enough.... and the PossibleCooker's many cooking functions means it will (in the long run) save me a fortune on my energy bills.

For instance, usually when I use my more affordable slow cooker at home, I would use my gas hob to sautee/sear my stew, casserole and pasta dish base ingredients first separately- and the Ninja PossibleCooker offers this function ahead of slowcooking.

I have loved taking straight to my recipe book which comes with the slow cooker and again, sautÃ©ing and searing my meats for dishes is a really great tool. For my chicken casserole it was just a turn of the dial to go from Sautee to Braise while I waited for it to cook for 1:45 hrs- and it's turned out a gorgeous, warming dish for after the school pick up.

It's a great tool BUT, the only thing I would say is wow it is big! I have cleared a full worktop and moved my kitchen around to make sure their is enough room to chop ingredients and fill plates around it, too.

Nevertheless, I'm really enjoying cooking in it- so much so that I am really excited to make my own bread in it this week too- I baked my own bread a lot during lockdown and want to put those skills to good use again and save us some more money during the chillier months.

There are tons of slowcooker options in various price brackets cropping up in Early Black Friday deals too.

Other popular brands, with more compact 8-1 cooking functions includes this JML slowcooker, currently £99 at Very. Although it has very similar functions- the Ninja Possiblecooker offers 3 litres more cooking space.

Also, Amazon has some incredible savings we have spotted on other slowcooking brands including Crockpot, Daewoo and Russell Hobbs- all under £30 and much more affordable if you don't need many fancy features.","https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article31382287.ece/ALTERNATES/n615/0_IMG_6288.jpg","Ninja PossibleCooker: With 8-in-1 cooking options to choose from",3,TRUE,FALSE

A woman left people in stiches when she posted a photo of some baking tins she had for sale - as people started to notice a rather risquÃ© tin among the regular cake moulds

Social media is a great place to catch up with friends and family, laugh at funny memes and sell unwanted items. But one woman who wanted to try and flog some of her baking tins left people in stitches when spotted a rather risquÃ© tin hidden amongst the others.

The baker's seemingly innocent post promoting their goods turned out to be a lot funnier than they initially intended. Most of her moulds were normal cake-shaped trays, with a few heart-shaped tins on offer, but people also noticed a cheeky tin that was shaped like a large penis.

Posting the advert online, she wrote alongside the post that she was looking for $50 for the whole set. It's unclear whether she was able to sell the array of tins, but it gave people a good giggle over it, as a screenshot of her post was later shared on the Kmart Unacks & Roasts Facebook group.

Members left several cheeky comments on the page, with one person quipping: ""Are you willing to split the lot and sell individually? There's just one in particular I'm in need of?"" Another replied: ""Thinking a freshly baked cake in a certain cake tin would go down a treat at the next lodge meeting.""

Others pretended not to know what the tin reminded them of. ""The lighthouse one looks useful,"" joked a third person. ""I love that 'elephant' tin,"" posted someone else. ""Save the 'trunk' for me."" And one woman seemed to be totally oblivious to the whole thing, proclaiming: ""This bundle would be so handy for the kid's birthdays.""

This follows a number of accidental rude birthday cakes, which have been cropping up online, with one mum trying her hardest to make her child an incredible Disney-themed cake for their big day. The cake, which looks to have been made for a six-year-old's birthday, features an image of the winged horse Pegasus and a silhouette of baby Pegasus, from the hit 1997 animated movie, Hercules. But the larger animal, made from black icing, ended up looking rather NSFW thanks to an unfortunate gap between the the adult horse and the baby horse, which made the former look rather well-endowed.

It's safe to say no one quite does 'luxury' like Selfridges, and as such, their premium Christmas countdown will not disappoint beauty fans

It's less than six weeks until the start of December which means beauty fans have a matter of weeks to choose which advent calendar they want to open to mark the Christmas countdown for 2023. And if you're big into your high end skincare, coveted cosmetics and luxury fragrance - Selfridges' festive haul needs to be on your radar.

This year the high end department store has launched a literal treasure chest of premium products with a whopping three drawers to discover, from cult-favourite formulas to skincare saviours. Worth over £1,000, it's priced at £220, making it one of the more expensive options on the market - but not the most expensive, as it goes.

Last year, the Selfridges calendar cost £210 and was worth over £800, and 12 months on the price has risen by £10 but the contents are worth £1,094 - nearly £300 more than last year. As such, that £10 price hike is pretty reasonable, in my opinion. Other beauty advent calendars that are worth over £1,000 this year include the likes of Liberty, Harrods, Fortnum and Mason, Cult Beauty and Space NK, all of which cost between £225 and £260. The only exception is Sephora , whose £189 countdown is worth over £1,045.

The Selfridges advent calendar opens up like a chest with a top layer alongside central and lower drawers. Inside the 25 numbered boxes, there are no fewer than 32 products to discover, as well as a Selfridges Beauty Concierge Card for a free treatment. Already there are four more products than last year, with some incredibly impressive brands stashed inside from the likes of REFY and Byoma, to Charlotte Tilbury and Augustinus Bader.

Of the 32 physical products, half of them are full-sized, and the variety is really well thought out and carefully considered, boasting a mix of skin, hair and beauty products, as well as lifestyle and wellness items, fragrances and more. It would have been impossible to pick a top five products to share with you, but I did manage to whittle my ""˜top 32' down to eight - which is still 25 per cent of the entire contents.

I'm a big fan of the influencer founded and loved brand Refy, having racked up a sizable collection of their products from the Brow Tint to the Cream Bronzer and multifunctional Lip Blush, so I immediately gravitated towards the brand's brow sculpt, worth £16, in the calendar. The wax-gel hybrid brushes and sets brows in place and has earned itself more than 2,600 five star reviews since it launched, and as someone who takes great care and attention with their brows, it's a product that's been on my lust list for a while.

Another relatively affordable product in the calendar is the BYOMA - De-Puff and Brighten Eye Gel, which is £12.99 at Boots. I've previously used a number of products from this brand in the past, so I'm hoping their targeted eye treatment will be just as kind to my skin and help banish my dark circles and puffy eyes.

There's no shortage of makeup in the Selfridges calendar , and it's all highly versatile, wearable and universally flattering. The Natasha Denona Mini Bronze Eye Palette features five neutral shades with a pop of shimmer that's perfect for taking your everyday look into Christmas party vibes. Meanwhile the 34ml Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray is a generous travel size and is perfect for setting your festive party look in place whether that's at home or on the go.

Now, I'm a MAC Velvet Teddy girl through and through. I've worn the same shade lipstick for nearly eight years, but Lisa Eldridge's Luxuriously Lucent Lip Colour from her eponymous makeup collection is a worthy upgrade with a beautifully buttery formula that glides onto lips like a dream.

When I was reviewing the contents of more than 40 beauty advent calendars, there was one product that kept cropping up time and time again, and that's The Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader , which is the most common addition to this year's beauty advent calendar launches. The brand is loved by a host of famous faces like Victoria Beckham and Kim Kardashian, and at £71 for 15ml, it doesn't come cheap, so the Selfridges countdown offers a chance to dip your toe into celebrity beauty without having to pay the full price.

Another brand I've seen a few times in calendars this year is MALIN+GOETZ, and their Dark Rum Candle is to die for. It's spicy, warm and seasonal without being overly festive and basically everything I look for in a home fragrance. And finally, my last pick of the Selfridges beauty advent calendar is the Gisou Honey Infused Hair Perfume , which is worth £64, which smells absolutely heavenly.

Selfridges - Beauty Concierge Card

It's safe to say, no one quite does 'luxury' like Selfridges, and as such, their premium Christmas countdown will not disappoint beauty fans, starring favourites like REFY and Charlotte Tilbury, alongside the likes of Lisa Eldridge's makeup line and the newly launched Rabanne Beauty.

Worth over £1,000 but retailing at £220, it's one of the more affordable high end calendars, cheaper than most premium options without compromising on indulgence, brand names or quality, making it a worthwhile investment for those looking to elevate their holiday beauty rituals.

The variety is so great to see and there's not a single product I won't make use of, and the addition of the Beauty Concierge Card is a thoughtful touch, meaning customers can have something to look forward to beyond December, too.

If you're keen to get your hands on a mid-range calendar, LookFantastic and ASOS are some great options for beauty advent calendars for under £100 this year. If you're looking for something even cheaper, Revolution has reduced their calendar to £40, with PrettyLittleThing's coming in at £48, with budget beauty options under £50 being popular choices as people look to maximise savings this winter.

But when it comes to savings, it's Glossybox that has the largest price to product value ratio, saving customers 83 per cent on the RRP - their calendar costs £80, but is worth a whopping £473.

A two kilometer wide structure which was spotted by satellite images in Antarctica has sparked wild rumours it could have been created by the Illuminati

Social media users and conspiracy theorists are claiming a new pyramid has been discovered in Antarctica. Recently, satellite images have been realised and many have been left convinced a mysterious triangle structure in the snowy and icy continent is the newest wonder of the world.

It's left multiple people scratching their heads and questioning where a new pyramid would have come from. The huge pyramid-shaped mass was seen from images taken over the southern part of Antarctica's Ellsworth Mountain range. Some odd look peaks, which seem to be emerging from the ground, have emerged.

One apparently measures up to two kilometers in each direction of its square base - which is very similar to the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. Since the photos emerged online this week, many conspiracy theorists have shared their thoughts on how the structure got there and what it could be.

One person tweeted: ""Wait how they moved the pyramids from Egypt to Antarctica?"", MailOnline reports. Artificial life or a secret society like the Illuminati have been among the strangest of suggestions, while others attributed the design to humans. Another social media user wrote: ""This structure belongs to the civilization which existed before the flood. Around 10,000 years ago Antarctica was warm.""

But before everyone got their tin foil hats too tight, it has emerged the structure is actually a mountain. Geologist Dr Mitch Darcy said: ""The pyramid-shaped structures are located in the Ellsworth Mountains, which is a range more than 400 km long, so it's no surprise there are rocky peaks cropping out above the ice. The peaks are clearly composed of rock, and it's a coincidence that this particular peak has that shape. It's not a complicated shape, so it's not a special coincidence either. By definition, it is a nunatak, which is simply a peak of rock sticking out above a glacier or an ice sheet. This one has the shape of a pyramid, but that doesn't make it a human construction.""

The Ellsworth Mountains are the highest mountain ranged in Antarctica, forming a 350km long and 48 km wide chain of mountains in a north to south configuration on the western margin of the Ronne Ice Shelf in Marie Byrd Land. They are located within the Chilean Antarctic territorial claim and were discovered in 1935 by Lincoln Ellsworth on a trans-Antarctic flight from Dundee Island to the Ross Ice Shelf. The temperature in the Ellsworth mountains average around a frosty -30C, and the range only has a short window to visit, with the best time for expeditions being through November to January.

Prince William and Kate Middleton were greeted by well-wishers during a trip to Rothesay, Scotland, where they met an outdoor charity Outfit Moray who support young people

Prince William and Kate Middleton wowed on a trip to an adventure and learning charity today.

Travelling north of the border to Rothesay, the couple were greeted by well-wishers before they members of the outdoor charity Outfit Moray. Dressed for the weather, Kate wore a padded jacket and jeans, whilst William wore a wax jacket and chinos.

Outfit Moray supports young people aged between eight and 18 and has worked with over 16,000 people since its creation, two decades ago. It runs a huge range of activities including mountain biking, paddlesports, rock climbing, bushcraft, and archery.

After that, Wills and Kate travelled to a nearby family-fun farm to learn about other efforts being made to support young people and their mental health. At Brodiehill Farm, they met members of the Lower Speyside Young Farmers group and representatives from Farmstrong Scotland.

The group has recently taken part in the ""Are ewe okay?"" campaign, led by the Scottish Association of Young Farmer Clubs, encouraging members to talk about mental health and break down stigma associated with the subject.

Lower Speyside Young Farmers is run for young people in the local area, giving them opportunities to socialise, and Farmstrong Scotland is committed to the wellbeing of farmers and rural communities. William and Kate are also expected to meet some families who regularly attend sessions at the farm's dedicated play area.

Developed to provide a space for young children to explore and learn, Brodiehill offers an indoor and outdoor area for play where families can focus on and connect with their children.

Love Island star Jessie Wynter had her boyfriend, Will Young, at her side as she was rushed to hospital while needing emergency treatment after she struggled to breathe

Love Island star Jessie Wynter has been rushed to hospital and needed emergency treatment to help her breathe after suffering a health emergency.

The 27-year-old reality star was a contestant on the Australian version of Love Island in 2019 before appearing on the UK version in January this year - where she was matched with 24-year-old farmer Will Young. While the duo didn't win the reality love show, they have remained in a happy relationship and live together on Will's farm.

Jessie was also able to rely on her boyfriend to help her get medical attention when she suffered a severe asthma attack over the weekend. Taking to Instagram Stories in the early hours of Monday, Jessie shared a photograph of herself looking drained while in a hospital.

The image showed her wearing an oxygen mask while Will was at her side to comfort her. Sharing details of her ordeal, Jessie wrote: ""Unfortunately my asthma got worse and turned into an attack so we had to make a trip to the hospital.

""Currently on my 3rd round of the nebuliser and have been given medication to help with my breathing. Hopefully can get home to bed soon. So grateful to have my beautiful boyfriend here with me.""

On Sunday, Jessie had hinted her health was worrying her as she shared a photo of Will taking care of her after her asthma symptoms left her bedbound. She wrote online: ""Spent the whole day in bed yesterday & today because my asthma is really bad and this cutie Brough me up some brekkie & a coffee now I'm awake.""

Laura then thanked her fans and social media followers for sending her messages of support. She shared a photo of herself laying in bed with a caption saying: ""It's not easy being wheezy.""

She then added a note of her own, writing: ""Thanks for all the messages and tips regrind my asthma. Makes me so sad to hear about how many others often go through this.

""Remember to stay safe and to never be embarrassed of having asthma! Make sure the ones around you are aware of what to do if you ever have a flare up or an attack.""

The weekend had begun on a more positive note, as Jessie showed her fans via Instagram that she and Will had dressed as Toy Story characters while out celebrating Halloween. She uploaded a string of snaps of them looking happy and loved up together at a raucous party.

She wrote: ""Swapped Farmer Will for Woody. This is going to be my first Halloween in the UK! We don't really celebrate Halloween where I am from so I have been soooo excited for this!! And to make things better I have my amazing boyfriend to get dressed up with.

""Will and I said to each other in the villa that if we did Halloween together we'll go as Jessie and Woody and here we are. Another thing to check off our bucket list.""

Our Yorkshire Farm star Amanda Owen's Valentine's Day snap has raised concern among her fans as they spot something which they couldn't unsee in the snaps

Amanda Owen has raised concerns following her latest Instagram offering which she posted on Valentine's Day.

The Our Yorkshire Farm star, 48, delighted her fanbase when she posted two snaps of two of her children tending to their beloved horses Josie and Princess.

Amanda looked radiant as she joined her two kids, and in the post, she penned: ""Brought Josie and Princess down into the pastures ready for the farrier visiting tomorrow. #yorkshire #horses #ponies #farrier.""

However, Amanda's fans flocked to comments to raise their concern about something which they couldn't unsee in the snaps.

Fans of the Channel 5 show, insisted that they missed seeing the Owen family together on their beloved show Our Yorkshire Farm.

Others questioned who looked after the farm while the children were in school and while Amanda is away filming for her new show on More4, called Amanda Owen's Extraordinary Farming Lives.

""Who looks after the farm and the children whilst Amanda is away for days filming,"" one curious fan asked.

""Just realised now that all the children are at school and it's only Clive and Amanda at home they've got no help during the day, so the only filming will be of them showing how hard it is to work by themselves, but they will get the help after school and at the weekends. This is where Amanda can really show how hard it is to be a sheep farmer where they are,"" someone else echoed.

""I miss seeing the whole family together. Wonder who looks after the farm all day these days,"" another questioned.

While someone else commented: ""Such gorgeous pictures.""

It comes after Amanda shocked fans when she revealed her kids were working on the farm using hammers and axes.

The Our Yorkshire Farm star shared snaps of her brood at Ravenseat, chipping away at hunks of wood - without wearing goggles.

Posting the photos on Twitter, Amanda wrote: ""Chips off the old block!""

However, her fans were worried about the children's safety.

One wrote: ""I recommend goggles for all!""

Another added: ""The kids should be wearing a pair of safety goggles at least.""

Amanda is getting used to a different way of life after splitting up from her children's father Clive, 67.

The couple announced their split last year, explaining in a joint statement: ""Clive and I have are sad to confirm that we have made the difficult decision to separate.

""This hasn't been easy, but we both believe it's the right choice for the future of our family.""

The statement continued: ""Although we are no longer a couple, we continue to work on the farm and co-parent together with our number one priority the happiness and well-being of our children.""

The mother-of-nine shares Raven, Reuben, Miles, Edith, Violet, Sidney, Annas, Clementine and Nancy, aged from 21 to five with her estranged-husband.

Instead of returning home to Tasmania, Jessie flew back to Buckinghamshire with Will after they were dumped from the villa before the final and enjoyed having their first real date at Tesco

Love Island sweethearts Will Young and Jessie Wynter spent their first real date on a trolley dash around Tesco.

And farmer Will, 23, admitted he is keen to walk ""marriage material"" Jessie down the aisle for real as he addressed rumours about his sexuality.

The TikTok sensation said: ""I was 100% myself in the villa. I'm happy with myself and I'm happy with Jessie.

""My brother is gay, and so I'm all for it. I don't think anyone can say that to me in a negative way. As a person I'm very outgoing and charismatic, and I'm not going to change.""

Aussie Jessie, 26, backed up her beau, saying: ""It's 2023 and judging people's sexuality is outdated and needs to get out of the window.""

Instead of returning home to Tasmania, the personal trainer flew back to Buckinghamshire with Will after they were dumped from the villa before the final.

The couple were happy to put the drama in South Africa behind them, after fellow islanders turned on Jessie in their last week, branding her ""fake"" in a storm of sniping and backbiting.

The attack was a second test for the pair, who admitted they came close to quitting the show after Will kissed bombshell Layla Al-Mamani, 28, when the girls were away in Casa Amor.

Since reconciling and arriving in the UK they've been happily embracing their freedom away from prying eyes.

And when it comes to building relationships through shared experiences, Jessie knows that every little helps.

She said: ""We've been having an absolute blast. We've got me to the farm, we've got back to the country.

""We went to Tesco for our first date - we did the big shop, picked up some snacks. Then we went to the village pub for steak and chips and a chicken burger. It was so nice to get out of the villa, and since we've left we've been a lot happier. We don't have people interfering in our relationship.""

Will revealed he can't wait to start his new life with girlfriend Jessie.

He said: ""I wouldn't be with her if I thought she wasn't marriage material. Our plan is to split our time between the UK and Tasmania.""

Jessie, who is keen to introduce Will to her family, added: ""I still can't believe that I went on Love Island and actually found the love I was looking for.""

Doug Inglis and Jenny Gussee, both 62, emptied a bottle of bear spray while out with their dog in Banff National Park in Canada when all three were horrifically killed

A harrowing final message sent by a couple just moments before they were mauled to death by a grizzly bear has been revealed by devastated family members.

In their final moments, Doug Inglis and Jenny Gusse, both 62, emptied an entire bottle of bear spray as they were mauled by the massive bear while out with their dog in Banff National Park in Canada. All three were horrifically killed. The couple, who were seasoned backcountry campers, sent an alarming message at around 8pm on Friday to Doug's uncle, Colin Inglis, which said ""bear attack bad.""

Parks Canada was made aware of the alert straight away but they were unable to send a helicopter due to hazardous weather. However, when they eventually arrived at 1am, they tragically found Doug, Jenny, and their Border Collie, Tris, lying dead next to two empty cans of bear spray.

The grizzly old female bear, who was discovered nearby, was shot dead after charging at park officials. Banff National Park, which attracts more than four million tourists every year, is home to both grizzly and black bears. Heartbroken Colin told CBC the couple were simply ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"", he said: ""That night was a start, obviously, of what's continuing to be a grieving process. You have that notification, you know that something bad is happening. You don't have a lot of information.""

Colin said he was informed that the couple had tried to scare off the bear, according to signs left at the site. He was told that a bear spray canister had been fully emptied. Officials at the parks report the couple had hung their food in the appropriate manner so as to not attract bears, and two cans of bear spray were found at the scene.

Colin added: ""There was a struggle and the struggle didn't stay in one place. But, in the end, both bodies were back together.""

Colin paid tribute to the pair, who loved being in the outdoors and had a real passion for adventure. The couple met at university and studied to be scientists before working together at the same lab for Agriculture Canada. He added: ""I was hiking in Waterton with Doug in June and we were looking forward to many more adventures. As were lots of his friends.

""One of his friends told me one of the things they were looking forward to was taking their son out with Doug because he was so knowledgeable. And Jenny, she was the botanist. She could identify all these wonderful plants that were out there, this berry or this flower. And so that's the kind of love they had for the environment that they were out in.""

Kim Titchener, a bear expert and a friend of the family, revealed there are about 60 grizzly bears in Banff National Park, with fatal attacks extremely rare. ""It's really just the reason why we're seeing more attacks, which is more people heading outdoors and unfortunately not being educated on this,"" she said, adding that only 14 percent of grizzly bear attacks worldwide lead to fatalities.

""'Often when people have encounters with grizzlies, usually the grizzly goes one direction and the people go in the other,'"" Titchener added. During the last 10 years, there have been three recorded non-fatal encounters with grizzly bears in the Park.

The first recorded bear attack of 2023 ended in a horror movie scene for one herder who was severely mauled by a black bear while two of his sheep were eaten before authorities managed to euthanize the animal

Colorado recorded its first bear attack of the year after a herder was mauled by a black bear that also killed two of the sheep lounging in by a reservoir near Durango.

The unidentified herder required emergency medical treatment and surgery after he was woken up in the middle of the night by a bear in his encampment. Reportedly, the victim heard a disturbance in the camp between a sheep and the bear.

He was able to get up and get his rifle, dislodging a few rounds aimed at the bear - but instead of becoming scared and backing off, the bear attacked.

The victim was severely bitten on his arms and head, with severe lacerations to his back and left hip. Two of the sheep were mauled to death.

""This is an unfortunate incident and we are thankful the victim was able to contact help to get emergency services deployed and that he was able to be extracted to receive necessary medical care,"" said CPW Area Wildlife Manager Adrian Archuleta.

According to Parks and Wildlife, the victim was able to crawl to his tent and contact his cousin following the attack. Emergency services were summoned to airlift the victim to Mercy Regional Medical Center. After the victim received initial treatment, the victim was flown to Grand Junction for surgery.

At the hospital, CPW was able to collect DNA samples from the victim so that they could begin a search for the bear.

""CPW was notified of the attack at 4 a.m., and three wildlife officers were at the Transfer Park trailhead and on the scene of the camp near the Burnt Timber Trail by 8:30 a.m. They quickly discovered a blood trail, the victim's rifle and collected multiple DNA samples from the attack scene. CPW also discovered two dead sheep at the site with wounds consistent with bear depredation,"" says the official blog.

Authorities were able to take this information and begin hunting for the bear. An agent from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) was able to assist on this trek and the team obtained trained dogs to help track the beast.

""The dog team arrived at 5 p.m. and began to work the scene. Soon after, the hounds alerted a scent trail on the south side of the creek drainage and were immediately in pursuit of a bear suspected in the attack,"" CPW said. ""The hounds pursued the bear to the Florida River, and CPW officers followed in steep and treacherous terrain following the GPS signal from the collars of the dogs. At 10:53 p.m., the APHIS agent shot and killed the bear. Because the bear made contact with a human, it is classified under CPW policy as an attack and the agency's policy is to euthanize the bear.""

Experts identified the bear as an eight-year-old male weighing 250 lbs. Authorities fired several shots, killing the bear. Its body was then examined and it was determined that it is mostly likely the correct bear who attacked the herder, as its stomach contents contained pieces of sheep wool.

""Until we get results back from the lab regarding DNA testing, we can't 100 per cent confirm that this is the offending bear,"" Archuleta said. ""But based on the information we have at this point, we feel confident that it is the offending bear.""

This is the first reported bear attack in Colorado in 2023 and the first in La Plata County since April 2021.

""This is a difficult part of the job,"" Archuleta said. ""But when it comes to injuries to humans as a result of a predator attack, human health and safety is our top priority.""

According to the World Animal Foundation, there are 40 bear attacks worldwide every year.

Schoolgirl Vilte was talking to her friends when she spotted the coin in the dirt at Winstanley School in Leicestershire, which has since been dated back to 1069

A schoolgirl has made an astonishing discovery of a 1,000 year old coin from the time of William the Conqueror - right in her school playground.

Vilte, a Year 9 pupil, initially thought she had found a 5p coin but was amazed to learn she'd stumbled upon a medieval treasure dating back a millennium. The 13 year old was enjoying breaktime with friends at Winstanley School in Braunstone, Leics, when she spotted the coin on a strip of grass.

With the help of her history teacher, she discovered it was a penny from around 1069, during the reign of William the Conqueror. It's thought that the historic coin may have been unearthed when workmen replaced a lamppost on the school grounds last summer.

Vilte noticed the coin was lighter than a regular 5p and had unfamiliar markings, so she took it to her teachers. She told the BBC : ""I was just talking to some friends and it caught my eye on the floor so I sort of picked it up. I took it to my history teacher's room and said 'do you know anything about this coin, because it looks really strange, and is definitely not your ordinary coin?'""

After some research, they discovered the coin's true age. ""It was really shocking. You don't expect to find that in your school, you know. It was just a little bit of a surprise,"" Vilte added.

Headteacher Dave Bennett confirmed that experts at Leicestershire County Council had verified the coin's identity. He said: ""When Vilte found it we knew it was some interest and then when we did some more research it was verified it was from that time.

""Then we tried to work out why it was there and why Vilte had found it and nobody else had noticed it. We had just had some building work done, with a telegraph pole lifted out and back in, and it must have come from that.

""But for Vilte to find it, most people would have just ignored it I think. You think maybe you'd find something from the 1960s but to find something 1,000-years-old is just amazing. At the moment its in the safe, but we don't think it should stay there. We'd like it to be displayed in a museum with Vilte's story.""

Samantha Curtis, from the school, added: ""We believe that the coin was disturbed by some construction work which had been carried out, and was probably unearthed with some of the mud. Vilte found the coin in amongst the grass which makes finding it even more remarkable.

""We have spoken to various agencies for advice, [the] Team Manager for Heritage at Leicestershire County Council said that the coin would have been a considerable loss for whoever had dropped it, probably from a pocket or coin purse, for a farm labourer or worker at the time it would have been of high value.

""At the time when the coin was in circulation the school site would have been agricultural land or forest not far from the ancient settlement of Braunstone. Our location is close to the Fosse Way, a popular route for people travelling from Leicester to other locations.

""We hope that a local museum might be interested in the coin for one of their collections, with Vilte being credited for its discovery. But we are still currently seeking the best outcome so that the coin can be preserved in the correct atmospheric conditions to prevent corrosion.""

A couple from America were left 'overwhelmed' at all the different choices in British supermarket Tesco - and were most stunned by the placement of the eggs

When you're on holiday in a different country, you'll notice a massive difference between British supermarkets and those abroad. Sometimes, you might be baffled by the layout or the products in the shop. If you've lived in the UK for any period of time, you will no doubt be used to the way things are sold and presented here.

But when American couple Cara Atwell and Jeremy Davis went to Tesco for the first time, they were baffled by what they spotted amongst the aisles.

The pair were so confused about where they found some items, but they were pleased to explore their first British ""grocery store.""

While travelling, the couple explored their first Tesco together in Devon, as they were keen to try Lucozade for the first time.

While exploring the aisles, Cara was particularly impressed that you could get dairy-free alternatives to halloumi on the shelf.

Another thing that baffled the couple was the placement of the eggs.

""We came around the corner and there's just a shelf of eggs"", Cara said in an amused voice. ""Not something I've seen in the US.""

This is because, in the US, it's the law to keep eggs refrigerated due to the salmonella risk. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) determined that the best way to fight Salmonella contamination is by sanitising the eggs before they reach the consumer.

In the UK chickens are vaccinated against salmonella, so British authorities encourage people to store eggs in an area below 20C, which is the case in most supermarkets.

They referred to Mr Kipling cakes as ""delicious"", and she said Rhubarb Crumble sounded ""really good"", then Cara said she felt ""overwhelmed"" by how many choices there were in the supermarket, and said she didn't know whether to get branded stuff, or Tesco own-brand as she was intrigued by it.

Cara then admitted that she'd ""never tried"" a Pot Noodle, but had ""seen a lot"" about them, saying that for 80p, they were going to take the plunge.

The pair were also shocked by the size of Frey Bentos pies, assuming they would've been smaller in real life.

Cara said: ""I think your cereal aisle is smaller than ours is in America, but we have a lot of the same cereals.""

They also checked out the crisp aisle, and then marvelled at the different flavour of KitKats like honeycomb that they ""don't have in America.""

""Bitter shandy?"", Cara asked. ""Made with real British beer for a rich refreshing taste"", she read. ""So it's like non-alcoholic beer?"" Bitter shandy sold in packs normally contains 0.5% alcohol.

And even Ben and Jerry's flavours are different in the UK in comparison to America, however, Cara did not know what ""frozen lollies"" were when she saw the signage for it, and Jeremy had to explain they're ""popsicles.""

They spent a lot of time perusing the ice-creams, remarking on how ""fancy"" the own-brand Tesco ice-cream tubs looked.

""We're definitely going to have to come back to get some frozen goods when we're closer to our Airbnb"", Cara gushed.

Cara told the Daily Mail: ""I'm not sure what we were expecting, but we had a nice experience. A lot of the items were cheaper than what they would cost in the US and it gave us a lot of ideas of foods we wanted to try in the future.

""I think Tesco would give other Americans a good idea of the range of products available in supermarkets in the UK.""

The artificial sweetener aspartame is found in Diet Coke, Fanta and Dr Pepper as well as chewing gum and Muller Light yoghurts and could soon be classed as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans""

The amount of Diet Coke you'd need to drink for it to pose a risk of cancer is currently unknown - but could be as much as a 'bucketful' a day, an expert claims.

The artificial sweetener aspartame found in the fizzy drink as well as chewing gum, Fanta, Dr Pepper and Muller Light yoghurts is set to be declared ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"" by the World Health Organization (WHO).

The chemical entered the market in the 1980s, but the recent news has sent shockwaves through fans of the low-calorie treats.

Now David Spiegelhalter OBE FRS, a British statistician and a Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge University, has weighed in.

He told The Mirror: ""This means that sweetener will join petrol, mobile phones, working as a firefighter, as well as many chemicals, as things IARC labels 'possibly carcinogenic', which essentially means we can't rule it out.

""But this classification says nothing whatever about the possible size of the harm. So we have no idea yet of how much Diet Coke you would have to consume each day to reach a level that would measurably increase your risk, but I suspect it may be at least a bucketful.""

Experts have questioned the organisation's decision, which is yet to be confirmed but will reportedly be made public in mid-July.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) ruling is intended to assess whether something is a potential hazard or not, based on all the published evidence.

It does not take into account how much of a product a person can safely consume, as one expert explains.

Mr Spiegtelhalter added that experts ""have no idea how big that bucket may have to be"", but the public should find out on July 14 from a separate expert committee who can advise on consumption for individuals.

The Joint WHO and Food and Agriculture Organisation's Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) is reviewing aspartame use this year.

Its meeting began at the end of June and it is due to announce its findings on the same day that the IARC makes public its decision.

A spokesperson for the WHO said: ""IARC has assessed the potential carcinogenic effect of aspartame (hazard identification).

""Following this, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) will update its risk assessment exercise on aspartame, including the reviewing of the acceptable daily intake and dietary exposure assessment for aspartame.

""The result of both evaluations will be made available together, on July 14, 2023.""

Everything we know about aspartame

According to WHO, the artificial sweetener has ""possible"" links to cancer.

This doesn't necessarily mean it directly causes the illness, but that there is a small amount of evidence linking its consumption with people who have been diagnosed.

The IARC has two more serious categories - ""probably carcinogenic to humans"", and ""carcinogenic to humans"".

The NHS says that while all sweeteners have to undergo rigorous testing being entering the food market in the UK, it has already ruled aspartame unsuitable for people with rare condition phenylketonuria as it contains an ingredient sufferers can't metabolise.

Anything branded as ""diet"", ""no"" or ""low calorie"", or ""sugar free"" is likely to have aspartame in such as Coke Zero, Sprite and Fanta Zero to sugar-free gum and reduced sugar ketchup.

The sweetener has also been added to medicines and supplements, including cough drops and vitamin gummies.

Instant coffee, sugar-free coffee syrups and dairy-free milks have been known to use it, too.

The only real alternative when it comes to swapping out Diet Coke is to switch to regular Coca-Cola, however the high amounts of sugar in fizzy drinks have long been a cause for concern by dieticians and dentists alike.

During the second day of their state visit to Kenya, King Charles and Queen Camilla met veteran Corporal Samwel Nthigai Mburia who claims to be aged 117 and fought for Britain

The King placed a medal on the chest of an ""amazing"" Kenyan soldier believed to be the oldest man in the world, aged a sprightly 117.

Veteran Corporal Samwel Nthigai Mburia says he was born in 1906 and served in the Far East in the British army during the Second World War. At the time, many ex soldiers lost their medals and the corporal was personally handed his replacement medal by Charles during a poignant ceremony on the second full day of the State visit to Kenya.

The moment came at a visit to a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery joining British and Kenyan military personnel in an act of remembrance. Charles told the veteran, ""You're amazing. You set us a great example. You must have been living on wild locusts and honey.""

The first Black Friday mattress deal has arrived and it is the lowest price ever



During the period of the Mau Mau rebellion period, many Kenyan army veterans who fought in the Second World War alongside the British lost their medals. He said, through his 54-year-old daughter, Idah Kagweni, ""I am so happy and proud to be receiving my medals from the King."" The other veterans who were presented with replacement medals were Private John Kavai, Private Kefa Chagira and Private Ezekiel Nyanjom Anyange. It came after the King expressed his ""sorrow"" and ""deepest regret"" over past colonial ""wrongdoings"" and British led atrocities.

When Kenya became a crown colony in 1920 settlers took over prime agricultural land and pushed the Kikuyu tribe out to protect their interests. At the end of the war in 1945, deep resentment by the Kikuyu led to attacks in 1952 by a banned secret society, Mau Mau, against those loyal to the government. The increased attacks led Governor Evelyn Baring to declare a state of emergency in October 1952 and Mau Mau leaders, including Kenya's future president Jomo Kenyetta were detained by the authorities.

The King and Queen also met Mr. Sam Mattock, who has taken the lead in identifying living war veterans, and sourcing replacement campaign medals. They joined British and Kenyan military personnel in an act of remembrance, before hearing about the Commission's work to ensure all those who supported Britain in both World Wars are commemorated. The cemetery they visited is linked to the Carrier Corps of the First World War and became known as ""˜Kariokor'. Most of the Kariokor casualties were not individually commemorated, and their contribution was largely overlooked.

Denisse Reyna, 19, Yuliana Macias, 21, and Nayeli Tapia, 22, were on a beach trip in Ecuador when they were found dead with their throats cut with chilling final texts emerging

Chilling text messages show some of the last messages sent by a group of women who were horrifically murdered on a beach trip in Ecuador.

Denisse Reyna, 19, Yuliana Macias, 21, and Nayeli Tapia, 22, were found buried in a shallow grave with their throats slit, three days after they went missing on April 4.

A group of fishermen made the grim discovery when they noticed a dog sniffing the ground by the Esmeraldas River near Quininde, Ecuador and smelt a foul stench.

It has now emerged that in the hours before they vanished, two of the women sent messages to love ones warning they were in danger.

A translation of one text read: ""I feel that something is going to happen.""

The women's family and friends told how Nayeli, who had a four-year-old daughter, sent her sister a WhatsApp message with her live location at 11.10pm on April 4.

It read: ""I'm just sending you just in case,"" and she was not heard from again.

The location later proven to be close to where the three women were found dead, according to the publication.

Denisse messaged a friend in her final hours which read: ""I feel that something is going to happen and if something happens to me, remember that I love you very much.""

It is believed the women were tortured, killed and buried on April 5.

Relatives said they were from Santo Domingo with similar hopes and dreams for the future.

Two of the women wanted to leave the country in search of a better future and they all left happy and smiling, it was said.

After their disappearance, it was initially thought they had been hired for a musical presentation.

But the theory was ruled out by relatives who said the last thing they knew was that the women would travel to the beach with some friends.

On the day of their fateful trip, a black Sail car picked up Denisse at around 9am after she was invited to the Casa Blanca hotel in Same.

At that time, she was not sure whether or not to go to the beach and preferred to say that she was going to have some breakfast.

It later emerged that Denisse and the driver picked up Nayeli on AlÃ³ag road, since she came from Quito.

In the afternoon, Denisse returned to her house with her friend to confirm the trip.

At night, Yuliana joined and told her relatives that she would be meeting a friend.

The young woman uploaded a WhatsApp status of the girls singing in a car and it is not know what happened next.

Their corpses showed signs of torture and had injuries caused by sharp weapons, perhaps machetes. All three were handcuffed.

The remains were transferred to the morgue, then handed over to their relatives who confirmed that they were Yuliana, Denisse and Nayeli.

Their relatives bravely decided to speak out to tell their stories and the dreams they had in life.

Nayeli grew up in Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas but lived in Quito and worked as a model.

Yuliana was a singing student and performed with the band Las Diablitas.

While Denisse was studying Agricultural Engineering at the State Technical University of Quevedo.

Oscar Pistorius has today been told he will be released from prison in January, nine years into his 15 year sentence for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp

Olympian and double amputee Oscar Pistorius has today been told he will be freed after serving nine years for the murder of his girlfriend and model Reeva Steenkamp.

The now 37-year-old killed his girlfriend on Valentine's Day, 2013, and was sentenced to 13 years and five months in custody after his conviction was upgraded to murder - he was originally jailed for just five years though this was later increased. Pistorius has since made multiple bids for parole, which have been rejected. However, he was granted a second chance at parole at a hearing in Johannesburg earlier this week, after being wrongly ruled ineligible for early release in March.

He will now be freed in January next year. The disgraced Paralympic sprinter, known as the Blade Runner, shot girlfriend Reeva dead at his home in Pretoria, South Africa. The Mirror was given exclusive details of Pistorius's life in Atteridgeville prison - a low-security site that has been described as ""comfy"". One jail source said: ""Pistorius remains muscular and fit. He has been seen driving a red tractor in fields around the prison, being trained to plough a straight furrow.

""The produce of the agriculture, including cauliflower, is then sold to help feed poverty-stricken schoolchildren."" One official who saw Pistorius, 37, said he was a model inmate but added: ""You can never tell if a prisoner is just putting on an act until he is released. Much depends on how much he's been concealing his true feelings and whether he has worked through them.""

Pistorius - who had both legs amputated under the knee as a baby - will have served nine years of a 15-year sentence for model Reeva's murder. Although Reeva's mum June opposes her daughter's killer being set free, she was not be in court for the hearing today after the death of Reeva's father Barry in September. In a heartbreaking statement she said: ""I am not attending Oscar's parole hearing, as I simply cannot muster the energy to face him again at this stage.

""Barry's demise had opened the wounds in many ways caused by Reeva's death. I had forgiven Oscar long ago, as I knew almost instantly that I would not be able to survive if I had to cling to my anger. ""ŒI do not believe Oscar's version that he thought the person in the toilet was a burglar. In fact, I do not know anybody who does. My dearest child screamed for her life; loud enough for the neighbours to hear her. I do not know what gave rise to his choice to shoot through a closed door four times at somebody with hollow-point ammunition when I believe, he knew it was Reeva.""

If you don't follow the laws when it comes to owning a dog you could face a fine or even end up in prison

When you take on a dog, you also take on a set of responsibilities, something not every new owner may be aware of.

Many of these responsibilities are governed by law and if these laws are broken you could end up paying a fine or even face community service or a custodial sentence.

There are laws on barking, identification, fouling, breeding, travelling in vehicles, keeping your dog on a lead and keeping it under control generally.

They've been put in place to keep animals safe and happy, as well as to protect both owners and members of the public from harm.

In 2022 there were nearly 22,000 cases of out-of-control dogs causing injury across England and Wales. Four years earlier, there were just over 16,000.

As well as a potential prison sentence, a serious dangerous dog incident can lead to the animal being destroyed.

As reported by Birmingham Live, here are the dog laws everyone should know - not just owners but also general members of the public who will encounter dogs at various points in their everyday lives.

Microchipping

The 2015 regulations for the microchipping of dogs impose strict rules so that pets can easily be identified if lost, stolen, found, or given or sold to a new owner. All dogs over the age of eight weeks must have a microchip fitted and the owner's details registered and kept up to date.

You could be fined £500 for not having your dog microchipped or failing to keep the database updated with changes such as a new address. If your dog is rehomed, the new owners must add their details. There are exemptions to microchipping if a vet believes there are valid reasons not to carry out the procedure.

Fouling

It is against the law not to clean up after your dog in a public place. Similar rules can apply even if it's on your own property - a man was recently prosecuted for failing to comply with a council's Community Protection Notice over the smell and health risk of dog poo littering his back garden.

Blue Cross Vets says canine faeces can contain parasites that cause blindness in people as well as pregnancy loss in cattle. Owners can be issued with a fixed penalty notice of up to £100 or a fine of £1000 if prosecuted for not complying with regulations.

Dog leads

The Highway Code states that dogs should not be let out on a road on their own and should be kept on a short lead when walking on the pavement or road or on a path shared with cyclists or horse riders. Councils can also make additional orders for dogs to be kept on a lead along 'designated' routes where signs will be installed to tell people they need to do so.

Many councils have also imposed Public Spaces Protection Orders that mean dogs must be kept on a lead in places such as children's play areas, parks, beaches and sports pitches.

Collars

As well as a microchip, dogs must wear a collar with the owner's name and address on it (or on a tag attached to it) when in a public place. Under the Control of Dogs Order 1992, owners can be fined up to £2,000 for not doing this.

Barking

Under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, barking can be classed as a statutory nuisance. The council can ask people to stop their dogs from annoying neighbours with persistent barking and, if it continues, they can even take the dog away.

Control

Allowing a dog to be dangerously out of control ""in any place"" is against the law, whether in public or in your own home or garden. However, a dog's owner or keeper would not be guilty of this if ""the person in relation to whom the dog is dangerously out of control is in, or is entering, the building or part as a trespasser"" - so if it bites a burglar or attacker who has no right to be in your home, this law doesn't apply.

Blue Cross Vets points out a dog doesn't have to bite or physically injure someone for it to be considered out of control - it could still be an offence if someone simply fears your dog could hurt them because of its behaviour.

Welfare/cruelty

Under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, dog owners can be prosecuted if they don't look after their pets and could face a fine of up to £20,000 or a prison sentence of up to 12 months, as well as a ban on keeping animals. The Act says pets have the legal right to be properly housed, given the right food and protected from pain, suffering, injury and disease.

Docking a dog's tail (except for medical reasons or in certain breeds) or cropping its ears is also illegal.

Travel

The Highway Code says that when in a vehicle, people must make sure dogs (or other animals) are ""suitably restrained so they cannot distract you while you are driving or injure you, or themselves, if you stop quickly"". A seat belt harness, pet carrier, dog cage or dog guard are recommended as ways of restraining animals in cars.

""ŒAgainst a backdrop of mutiny and discord Maher has heroically built a competitive team who would be on the verge of the National League play-offs without a 10-point deduction for breaking financial rules

On football's Death Row, Southend United are back in the High Court on Wednesday, and Judge Sebastian Prentis has warned the Shrimpers are in the last chance saloon.

""ŒIf under-fire chairman Ron Martin hasn't settled a £275,000 tax bill, the club will be wound up - and 117 years of history will become an end-of-the-pier show. A club once managed by England greats Bobby Moore and Sol Campbell will be consigned to the past tense.

""ŒAmid the soul-destroying gloom, there are shafts of hope. Martin hopes to conclude the sale of Southend to a consortium headed by Aussie businessman, Justin Rees, this weekend, but the fans ran out of patience with his brinkmanship long ago.

""ŒEarlier this month, at the home win against Maidenhead, they held up play for four minutes by hurling plastic RATS on the pitch in protest at the soap opera. In a country where nobodies get a seat in the House of Lords and dressed in ermine, now we've got a football club owner being dubbed 'Ron the Rat' and lampooned as vermin.

""ŒAnd last weekend, hundreds of fans marched from Pier Hill to Roots Hall demanding Martin's abdication with the effigy of a clown mounted on a makeshift hearse.

""ŒAgainst this backdrop of mutiny and discord, Southend manager Kevin Maher has heroically built a competitive team who would be on the verge of the National League play-offs, not marooned in the bottom four, without a 10-point deduction for breaking financial rules.

""ŒSeventeen years ago, Maher was the Shrimpers captain as they dumped holders Manchester United - with Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney playing 90 minutes - out of the League Cup. Freddy Eastwood's soaring free-kick and the seaside giddiness of a famous upset are light years from the club's current high-wire plight for a proud son of Essex who made more than 450 appearances as a player for Southend. Here's hoping that the tale of Shrimpers and a High Court judge's prawn ultimatum has a happy ending.

""Œ""I lived through the highs of knocking out United and two promotions in a row,"" said Maher. ""This is very different, but I don't allow myself to think that the club might not exist this time next week. I've not let myself go there and I'm hopeful of some positive news in the next couple of days.

""Œ""It's been a difficult time for the fans, and the uncertainty has been unsettling for them, but I've tried to focus on giving them a team worth watching. My wife and three boys come to every home game in their Southend shirts so they know what goes on, and I don't have to pull the wool over their eyes when I come home from work.

""Œ""Football is an emotional game, it's been an interesting time to say the least, and you can't allow yourself to be distracted too much by the outside noise.

""Œ""But I believe in this club, I believe something positive is around the corner and I believe we will emerge from this predicament. That's what keeps me going every day.""

Watch the Greatest Rivalry in Golf as Europe and the USA once again go head to head in a weekend of unmissable Ryder Cup action. You can watch every drive and putt live exclusively on Sky Sports for just £15 extra a month.

""ŒSomehow Maher, 46, has motivated the Shrimpers - who play Oxford City, also once managed by 1966 World Cup hero Moore, the night before their High Court date with destiny - to defy the odds despite multiple handicaps.

""ŒAlready under a transfer embargo, Southend were hit by the water mains being turned off at their Boots & Laces training ground in July over, you guessed it, an unpaid bill.

""ŒHe said: ""On a daily basis we have faced different challenges and the problems have kept cropping up, whether it was a period with no water or a year without GPS technology, which a lot of clubs take for granted now. And on the pitch the National League is relentless - the intensity is high and we are demanding a lot of the lads when we've only got a core squad of 16 players.

""Œ""I want people to look at the quality of our football and the connection between the team and our supporters has been incredible. If we come out the other side of this situation, those fans deserve the brighter times ahead.""

An interactive map that looks into the future has predicted big swathes of the UK, including parts of London, will soon be under water unless significant effort are made to try and stop climate change

Conversation around climate change has drastically shifted over the years, as its devastating impacts start to show.

Once dismissed as eco-warrior scaremongering, more and more Brits are started to get concerned about the state of the planet. In fact, figures from the Office for National Statistics show a staggering 74 per cent of adults in Great Britain aged 16 or over are worried about the current climate crisis.

A new interactive map that shows what the country could look like in 2050 has ramped up the fear. Created by climate Central, the map predicts huge parts of the country will be totally underwater in less than 30 years time, unless there is significant action to combat global warming.

Areas shaded red on the map are those lower than predicted local sea water and coastal flood protections. In a scenario in which 'moderate' reductions are made to the amount of human made pollution, and in which a 'medium' amount of luck keeps weather events on our side, great swathes of the country will be enveloped.

The worst affected parts of the UK are the east and north-east of England. A huge area of land stretching from above Cambridge all the way up the coast to Hull will be underwater.

Across the country Liverpool, Southport, Blackpool and Morcambe will also be swamped. In the south-west the River Severn will play havoc, with stretches on either side of the estuary - from Taunton up to Tekesbury and then back down to Cardiff on the northern bank - at risk of being lost to the waves.

London also looks to be in trouble. A band roughly two miles thick along The Thames will be flooded. Mercifully, Scotland and Northern Ireland look to be less seriously affected, with only small areas along rivers and in the Hebrides underwater.

The conclusion that should be drawn from viewing the map is clear: if we don't stop releasing green house gases into the air, large parts of Britain will be underwater. The data was put together in a 2020 October report entitled 'Flooded Future: Global vulnerability to sea level rise worse than previously understood'.

It revealed coastal elevation levels across wide areas are actually significantly lower than previously thought. The findings of the study by Dr Scott Kulp and Dr Benjamin Strauss, senior computational scientist and chief scientist respectively at US-based climate change research group Climate Central, were published in a peer-reviewed paper in the scientific journal 'Nature Communications'.

They said in the report: ""As humanity pollutes the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, the planet warms. And as it does so, ice sheets and glaciers melt and warming sea water expands, increasing the volume of the world's oceans. The consequences range from near-term increases in coastal flooding that can damage infrastructure and crops to the permanent displacement of coastal communities.""

There is still a huge amount to play for however. By current projections, sea levels could rise between 2ft and 7ft by the end of the century. If the world moves to drastically cut the amount of pollutants dumped into the atmosphere that figure could be on the lower end of the scale.

When Teresa Jack, 32, from Utah, US, adopted Watson the corgi, she promised to give him a lifetime full of love - despite the fact he'll never be able to bark again

A woman is raising awareness of dog debarking after witnessing the impacts of the cruel procedure on her adopted pooch. Teresa Jack, 32, from Utah, US, spotted three-year-old corgi Watson in a rescue shelter five years ago and was told that he'd never be able to bark like a normal pup again.

His voice had been taken away because of complaints in his apartment building. Despite making the decision to operate on Watson, his family realised not long after that it was best to find him a new home. Lifelong corgi owner Teresa couldn't believe the horrific treatment he'd undergone and promised to take care of him.

She told the Mirror: ""I had never even heard of the procedure. His previous owners still tried to market it to us as a selling point, so I don't think they even realised the cost this had for him.""

Debarking or devocalisation is a surgical operation that involves removing parts of a dog's vocal cords to stop them from barking.

Under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, it is illegal in the UK but it is still permitted in many US states.

""Ultimately, whenever someone makes a decision to debark a dog, it's never in the dog's best interest,"" Teresa explained.

""It's always in the interest of the owners, the housing complex or the breeder. It takes away a dog's ability to warn someone they perceive as a threat or cry out for help.""

Teresa said eight-year-old Watson has been her ""most challenging dog to date"" as he can no longer communicate in the only way he knows how.

The poor pooch previously lived with children, but now cannot be around kids ""because he cannot speak so he will snap if boundaries are pushed"".

""Watson is suspicious and always on guard. I can see anxiety in him and he can never relax anymore,"" Teresa said.

Once a gentle family pet, Watson now needs to wear a muzzle even when he is being cuddled indoors.

""We still spend time with him and show him love, and it's clear he craves it desperately,"" Teresa said.

""But he doesn't get the same amount of pets and affection other dogs do now because he needs really clear boundaries.""

While Teresa has tried not to judge the family who had Watson before, she now has to ""live with the consequences of their actions"".

The dog lover is campaigning to ban the debarking of animals in all US states and prevent housing developers from requiring it under Watson's Law.

""Most veterinarians refuse to perform debarking, and it is no longer being taught in veterinary schools, but housing companies can still get a court order to force you to have this surgery on your dog,"" Teresa explained.

Canine behaviourist Devin Smith told the Mirror: ""Since the surgical procedure involved in debarking is for convenience purposes only - similar to ear cropping and declawing - the UK government made it illegal.

""They deem it a form of mutilation because it involves removing part of a dog's vocal cords (which means that their bark is lessened or muted) when the owner or those living near the dog doesn't wish to listen to barking noises.

""There have been many cases where the surgery has left large amounts of scarring, and there have also been instances of regrowth around the surgery site later on in life, which can make it difficult for the dog to breathe as they get older.

""A dog will often bark when they have an issue, if they're in pain, stressed or anxious. They typically use barking to alert their owner that something isn't right.

""When you take this very important form of communication away from them, they will feel incredibly alone and distressed, which can lead to huge amounts of anxiety.""

The ancarcho-punk band Chumbawamba were reportedly approached by Clarkson to pay royalties to use one of their tracks to feature on a new TV series but the band declined

The lead guitarist for the anarcho-punk and folk band Chumbawamba has boasted to his followers he's turned down a deal from TV broadcaster Jeremy Clarkson.

Taking to Twitter Boff Whalley claims he's been approached by Clarkson's team who have reportedly offered the handsome sum of £30k for permission to use one of their tracks in a trailer.

Although Boff doesn't name the use, he does share that it's wanted for 'Clarkson's new TV show' the track 'Tubthumping' could be an apt fit given the broadcasters latest backlash.

Clarkson, found himself once again on the back foot as he waded in on the Sussex's situation with controversial comments about Meghan Markle in his Sun newspaper column, for which the title since issued an apology.

The track features the lyrics: ""I get knocked down, I get up again, you're never gonna keep me down.'

Boff tweeted: ""So anyway today we turned down £30,000 for our song to be used for a trailer for Jeremy Clarkson's new TV series. I can't tell you how much satisfaction that gave us.""

Followers were quick to praise the singer for placing his principles before a pay out.

One posted:"" You stick by your guns mate, £30k a lot of money but being able to look at yourself in the mirror is priceless.""

Another added:""That's a life-changing sum for us songwriters, but I'd have done the same. Massive kudos to you.

A third tweeted: ""Well done. Great to see real integrity.""

And although a drop in the ocean compared to the sum he has turned down, one follower penned a witty reply: ""Just bought your book based on this tweet.""

The backlash comes as the broadcaster turned farmer told how he had closed the restaurant on the Diddly Squat farm after a long-running battle over suitability of the rural site for the development.

The former Top Gear host opened it in a barn in a field last July despite protests from locals.

Amazon Prime announced last year that the show which features the running of the Cotswolds farm will be returning to the streaming service this month.

This second chapter will introduce new animals and crops to the Diddly Squat farm, with Clarkson also dealing with the council in his desire to establish a restaurant on the rural site.

Clarkson's Farm isavailable to watch now on Prime Video with the new series scheduled to land on February 10th.

Emma Whitfield lost her son Jack Lis in a horrendous dog attack while the 10-year-old was playing at his friend's house - now she's calling for action on breeds like the notorious XL Bully

Heartbroken Emma ­Whitfield says she is still haunted by seeing her fatally injured son dragged away by the arm from an XL Bully.

The distraught mother is ­determined no other parent should face the trauma of losing a child to a dog mauling and is campaigning for an urgent change of the law.

Emma, 32, said: ""I still have terrible flashbacks. I still see the animal and its teeth. I hear the barking. You relive it multiple times a day - it's torture.""

Just two months after her son Jack's death, Brandon Hayden, the owner of the 7st XL Bully named Beast, advertised dogs for sale, including one also called Beast.

Emma said: ""I felt sick. It showed no remorse.""

Hayden, 19, who fled the scene of the attack, was sentenced to just over four years at a young offender institution and Amy Salter, 29, was jailed for three years. They pleaded guilty to being in charge of the dangerously out of control dog, which caused ­catastrophic injuries to Jack's head and neck.

Since Jack's death 18 months ago, 15 others have lost their lives, including a 34-year-old man in Greater Manchester this month.

Emma, who is calling for the ""Jack Lis law"", said: ""Enough is enough. This has to stop.

Time for action on Danger Dogs

The Mirror is calling for:

â– 1 The overhaul of the Dangerous Dogs Act. An urgent review of the law is needed and tougher penalties should be considered.

â– 2 Enforce the rules to stop the illegal and irresponsible breeding and selling of dogs.

â– 3 A public information campaign to promote the importance of responsible dog ownership and the need for training.

""It's mind-blowing how it keeps happening. It should never have happened to Jack but why has nobody learned from this?

""Innocent people are dying. The Government needs to act now. It's out of control and there are people losing their kids because of this. I want to stop this happening.""

Emma has joined forces with the Mirror, the Dog Control Coalition and Labour MP Wayne David to fight for an urgent review of the law.

She said the dog that killed her son was a ticking time bomb but warned there are many more ready to strike. Last year, there were nearly 22,000 cases of out of control dogs causing injury in England and Wales compared to 2018 when there were just over 16,000.

The Dog Control Coalition includes Battersea Dogs & Cats Home, Blue Cross, the British Veterinary Association, Dogs Trust, Hope Rescue, the RSPCA and the Scottish SPCA.

Speaking on their behalf, the RSPCA head of companion animals, Dr Samantha Gaines, said: ""We look forward to working with the Mirror to improve public safety and dog welfare.

""All the evidence tells us aggressive behaviour develops because of complex interactions between genetics and the experiences dogs have throughout their lifetime; it is not simply a case of breed.""

They praised the Mirror calling for the ""promotion of responsible dog ownership, training and a ­crackdown on illegal and irresponsible breeding"".

""We also strongly support the call for an urgent review of the law,"" they added.

""The Dangerous Dogs Act has failed to protect the public from the risk of bites, we want a new approach. It is also essential ­measures are available to deter and punish owners of dogs whose behaviour is dangerous. ""

Caerphilly MP Wayne David told the Mirror it was an ""epidemic"". He said: ""We have to ask who is next?

""There can be no doubt that radical reform is needed to dog law.

""This will only happen when everyone who is concerned pulls together. That's why I've linked up with Emma, the Mirror and the Dog Coalition. Now the Government has to listen to us, and act.

""I'm quoting the police when I say there is more money in selling dogs for some criminals than selling drugs. I'm determined to see this issue addressed by the ­Government as soon as humanly possible.""

Emma told how Jack came home from school, grabbed his skateboard, and said: ""I'm going out to play, Mum.""

Just 10 minutes later, there was a knock on the door and his mother's torture began.

She is haunted by the image of a policeman opening the door of a nearby house and ­dragging her fatally injured son out by his arm.

""People were banging the window to try to distract the dog,"" she recalled. ""The officer had Jack by the arm and pulled him out and that's how I saw Jack.

""The dog was trying to fight to get out of the door, his head was through the gap and the officer managed to push the dog back.

""I still find it unbelievable. Sat on the sofa, or on the way home, and it hits you all over again.""

Jack suffered unsurvivable ­injuries in a house in Caerphilly, near Cardiff, just minutes from his home on November 8, 2021. Only a year later, in December 2022, just a street away, an 83-year-old woman was killed by a dog and earlier this year a baby was also hurt in a dog attack nearby.

Emma said these types of dogs have become ""status symbols"", adding: ""But to me it is no different than having a lethal weapon.""

The dog that attacked Jack had been with Hayden for four days.

""The owner tried to get rid of the dog for £100 because it was ­aggressive and didn't get on with other dogs,"" Emma explained.

""He got rid of it for free in the end. He gave it to Hayden who clearly didn't have a clue about dogs and abused it. CCTV showed him kicking the dog, the dog attacking numerous people and trying to get to kids. It was a recipe for disaster.""

That disaster happened after Jack met one of his friends who asked: ""Do you want to come and see my dog?""

Emma said her son loved their Shar Pei dog and cats. ""Jack was so cuddly. He would be on the sofa with the dog tucked into him and the cat lying across him,"" she said.

""They would gravitate towards him and he absolutely loved them.

""Everywhere he went he was covered in cat fur.""

Emma added she is not out to get all breeders or owners.

She explained: ""My problem is with backyard breeders who don't care where the dogs go. There is no reason why a dog needs to sell for £10,000 to go into a family home.""

After Jack's death Emma looked into the muscular XL Bully, which was developed from the American Pit Bull Terrier, and is not recognised as an official breed by the UK's Kennel Club. She said: ""I came across ­cropping ears, the way they exercise them so their muscles are more prominent in certain areas.""

Emma wants tougher sentences, as the woman jailed over Jack's death could be out this Christmas.

""She only missed one Christmas when we have lost a lifetime of them,"" Emma said.

Talking about family life now, she said: ""We are missing a piece. We are not whole. His little brother James turned 10 in August - there are 18 months between them.

""In your head you're thinking, ""˜Jack should be next to him'.

""I used to do everything in twos. Now instead of seeing two boys off to school, it's just one.""

Just as we finished our interview, news emerged that a man had been killed by a dog and Emma shook her head in bewilderment.

""How is this still happening?"" she asked.

Voice of the Mirror

THESE are the names of the children we have failed: Jack, Lawson, ­Bella-Rae, Daniel, Kyra and Alice.

In November 2021, 10-year-old Jack Lis was mauled to death by a dangerous dog while visiting a friend's home in Caerphilly.

A few months later, two-year-old Lawson Bond suffered fatal injuries following a dog attack in Egdon in Worcestershire.

A fortnight after Lawson died, 17-month-old Bella-Rae Birch was killed by her family's dog at her home in St Helens, Merseyside.

Then came Daniel John Twigg, who was attacked outside his home in Greater Manchester, three-month-old Kyra Leanne King and four-year-old Alice Stones.

In the last 18 months, 15 people have been killed by out-of-control animals. Thousands more have suffered terrible injuries.

After each horrific event there is an outpouring of anger. Distraught families plead for action. Politicians offer words of sympathy.

And what happens? Nothing.

Despite repeated calls for help the Government has refused to act.

It is obvious the Dangerous Dogs Act is no longer fit for purpose. The roll-call of lost lives is proof that we need to tighten the laws on the breeding, sale and ownership of dogs.

Ministers could intervene. They could take urgent steps to prevent another life being lost.

Do they not care about Jack or Lawson or Bella-Rae or Daniel or Kyra or Alice or any of the other victims? Or is it that they regard some lives as less valuable than others?

The Mirror today steps up our demand for action to tackle the scourge of dangerous dogs.

We are not going to stand by as more children die. We are not going to wait for another youngster to be brutally killed before people are finally galvanised into action.

Tragic schoolboy Jack Lis, 10, was mauled to death by an American XL Bully called Beast while visiting a friend's home in Penyrheol in Caerphilly, Wales, in November 2021

The mum of a schoolboy mauled to death by an American XL Bully dog is still haunted by the image of her son's injuries.

10-year-old Jack Lis was killed by the dog - named Beast - while visiting a friend's house in November 2021.

Police were forced to shoot dead the pet after arriving at the scene in Penyrheol in Caerphilly, Wales, and owners Brandon Hayden and Amy Salter were later jailed.

Jack's heartbroken mum Emma Whitfield said the dog attacked her son's face and neck.

She said when a paramedic brought out a blanket suddenly she realised he wasn't going to make it.

But Emma added she tries to remember him going out earlier that day ""with his skateboard in his hands"" rather than the horror of his final moments.

Have you been affected by this story? Let us know at webnews@mirror.co.uk

Speaking to BBC's Panorama, she said: ""They kept saying that they were working on him, they're working on him.

""And then the paramedic walked away and came back with a blanket and I knew. I can't say out loud what else I saw because I don't want other people to have to picture it either.""

She then added: ""Every time I shut my eyes I try to tell myself: 'That's not the last image that I've got of him'. I try and tell myself it was when he shut the door with his skateboard in his hands.""

Emma's interview comes as part of a Beeb investigation which has uncovered how organised crime is moving into the world of dog breeding.

American Bullies are not a banned breed in the UK but have been responsible for a rising number of fatalities in recent months.

Inspector Ian Muttitt, from the RSPCA's special operations unit, told BBC's Breakfast show today there has been a change in what he had seen in extreme dog breeding.

He said the charity has seen a ""huge increase"" in complaints in relation to the welfare issues associated with the practice - especially relating to Bullies.

Mr Muttitt said there has been a major rise in the breed appearing in Britain, as well as cropping of their ears as part of a cosmetic redesign, which is illegal.

""Obviously the RSPCA's primary concern is the welfare of the dogs but any breeding that focuses on cosmetics and how the dog looks, rather than, for instance, its temperament or health and welfare, is a real concern to us,"" he continued.

He explained that cutting off a dogs ears is ""totally unnecessary"" and has a detrimental impact on how the animal interacts with people.

The way these types of dogs are bred to have excessive skin around the face, as well as a flat and shortened nose, could be a reason why they are ""prone"" to skin conditions and respiratory and mobility issues.

654,"The ""˜leaked' Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom OLED Switch isn't real - here's why","https://www.mirror.co.uk/gaming/leaked-legend-zelda-tears-kingdom-28870975","The ""˜leaked' Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom OLED Switch isn't real - here's why

Images of a supposed new Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom themed OLED Switch have appeared online.

Whenever a big exclusive is set to come out, the rumour mill always goes into hyperdrive with speculation over whether there'll be a shiny new limited edition console. And when Zelda and Nintendo are concerned, doubly so.

Over the weekend, pictures were posted to Nintendo fan forum Famiboards that appear to show a limited edition Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom-themed Nintendo Switch OLED out in the wild.

Now I'm not here to say that there won't be a Zelda-themed Switch at some point. We already have Skyward Sword HD -themed Joy-Con, and pretty much every Nintendo system since the DS has had a Zelda-themed version at some point.

There was even a Wind Waker Wii U. So it would be a safe bet to assume there will be a Nintendo Switch with a ruddy great Triforce on the back of it at some point - maybe even for Tears of the Kingdom, I just don't think this is it.

Bursting the bubble

I hate to be the bearer of bad news but this clearly fake, though admittedly it's very cleverly constructed. From a cursory glance, it all looks about right, but as with most forgeries - the devil is in the details...

The first thing that struck me was that the pair of Joy-Cons don't quite look right. In the shot of them nestled in the packaging, the right joy-con seems to be missing its Infra Red camera. Also, Nintendo hasn't released any metallic Joy-Cons. The trend has been to stick to a set range of colours; even the multi-coloured Splatoon 3 Joy-Cons are still made up of colours that have previously been used on other sets.

Then when you look at the Switch itself, it's incredibly plain. Look at the other limited edition Switch OLED models released thus far and they both feature bright, exciting artwork on the back. There's not even a Triforce on it. Just the same swirly pattern which also covers the rest of the box. I just don't think Nintendo would have such a drab design on the back of what will likely be one of the console's last big flagship releases, especially if Nintendo's next-gen could start in 2024

Before I get into all of the nit-picky stuff, here's the big one for me: the box isn't right. Assuming Nintendo has a standard carton for the Switch OLED, the interior of the one shown in the pictures isn't it. There's a clear thumb hole to lift the unit out of the carton. The OLED box instead has a large gap at the bottom of the carton to help you lift it out.

Finally, the composition and subjects are decidedly sus. First there's the odd cropping of the pictures so you never see the whole of the box. And there's also no pictures of the system outside of the box, or with the Joy-Cons attached or working. If you were leaking pictures of a system you have pinched from work, why not go all out?

The perspective is also flat, the Switch logo is too bright compared to the rest of the box, and finally - whoever took these ""˜photos', according to the timestamp, managed to take three shots of a single box from different angles, in a minute. Something that, due to the speed at which most phone cameras take photos and how each shot is presented is physically impossible.

We all want a Zelda-themed OLED Switch. It's 129 days until the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. But come on, I'm sure that Nintendo can come up with something better than this design. Especially considering we're talking about the sequel to Breath of the Wild . One of the best games ever made.

The family of a seven-year-old boy who was bitten on the head by a dog in the beer garden of a pub where his mum works, has slammed the animal's owners for not coming forward.

The youngster suffered serious injuries to his scalp and needed emergency surgery following the shocking attack in Swanage, Dorset on Tuesday afternoon.

The owners of the large dog, possibly a German Wirehaired Pointer, left the pub before the emergency services arrived and without leaving their details.

It has since emerged that the couple, a man and a woman aged in their late 40s or early 50s, were visitors to the seaside resort.

They had been staying in their own campervan at a local holiday park which they have since left.

The police have been given their details by staff at the park.

The boy, who has not been named, was at the Crow's Nest Inn pub in Swanage at the time of the attack, as his mother works there.

A family friend said today that he was 'on the mend' after undergoing an operation under general anaesthetic at Poole Hospital.

His auntie has taken to social media to express her anger that the dog owners hadn't turned themselves in.

She said: ""I can't believe they still haven't been found or why they have not come forward. What kind of people are they?

""Absolutely Shocking.

""After the attack the couple took their dog and immediately left.

""The police are still looking for them.

""This is extremely serious and is important that they find this dog.

""This dog was not on a lead. My nephew did not do anything to provoke the attack.

""He had surgery on his head and thank God is recovering.

""They need to be caught before it happens again as maybe that person/child might not be so lucky next time.""

Dorset Police has issued a photo of the man and woman restraining a dog moments after the attack.

The man has short cropped grey hair and was wearing black-rimmed glasses at the time.

The woman has shoulder-length brown hair and was wearing a dark blue or black jacket and blue and white shorts at the time.

The dog is believed to be either a German Wirehaired Pointer or an Italian Spinone breed. It has brown and white shaggy fur.

PC Alistair James, of Purbeck police, said: ""This was understandably a distressing incident for the young boy involved and his family and we hope he makes a full recovery from his injury.

""We are conducting enquiries into this matter and have obtained an image of a man and woman with the dog that was believed to be involved.

""We are keen to speak to these people so we can take their account of what happened.

""I would urge anyone with information relating to their identity to please come forward. I would also ask the man and woman pictured to please do the right thing and come forward.

""I would also like to hear from any witnesses to the incident who have not already spoken to police.""

TikTok star and farmer Will Young has rubbed up a number of Love Island viewers the wrong way after showcasing his hyper dance moves

Love Island viewers have had enough of Will Young's 'criminal ' dad dancing.

Although he farmer's fellow islanders are loving his high energy, the same can't be said for a slew of annoyed ITV viewers who have begged the TikTok star to 'just sit down' and quit his 'dad dancing'.

Will, 25, who is coupled up with ring-girl Olivia Hawkins, 27, has already irked viewers with his bubbly personality and hyperactive mannerisms after he threw some moves while the sexy singletons played a wild game of dares around the fire pit.

The cheeky games saw some islanders show off their 'orgasm faces' as others got stuck into smooching each other - all the while, Will found himself throwing shapes alongside his fellow islanders.

After Will showcased his moves - which consisted of some bum shaking and twerking - viewers took to Twitter to complain.

""Will needs to sit down! He's the most annoying person this series,"" one complained.

""OMG Will and his criminal dad dancing NEEDS TO STOP,"" another echoed.

""I really love Will but all that random dancing is really getting on my nerves. Wish he would stop and chill and just be himself instead of being so extra,"" someone else tweeted.

""Someone tell Will to sit down and stop dancing,"" a fourth Love Island viewer raged.

While another quipped: ""He should have applied to Strictly instead.""

However, some other Love Island viewers were loving Will's infectious energy.

""OMG! Why is everyone hating on poor Will? He's LITERALLY the only person in the villa with a personality. Leave my king alone,"" one viewer defended.

""People really can't handle someone hot who has a personality too. Will deserves so much better,"" another agreed.

While someone else joked: ""YOU ALL JUST WISH YOU WERE WILL with those moves.""

It comes as Will was forced to watch his ring girl Olivia re-couple with surprise bombshell Tom Clare.

The TikTok star is now the only singleton in the villa.

Marian Clode was holidaying with family on a farm in Northumberland in Easter 2016 and was taking a walk when the cow broke loose from a herd and charged at her, causing her catastrophic spinal injuries

A teacher died after a cow escaped from a farm and charged at her as it went into ""full-blown fight mode"", tossing her over a gate.

Marian Clode was walking along a bridlepath during an Easter break in Northumberland with family when the animal broke loose and attacked her three times, a court heard. The 61-year-old suffered a severe spinal injury in the horrific incident in April 2016, tragically dying days later in hospital.

Farmer Alistair Nixon appeared in court on behalf of the JM Nixon partnership, which runs Swinhoe Farm, near Belford, where Mrs Clode was attacked by the animal whilst with her two grandchildren, husband, daughter and son-in-law. The 62-year-old pleaded guilty to a health and safety breach after admitting failure to ensure the safety of persons other than employees by exposing them to risks to their safety from the movement of cattle.

Craig Hassall KC, prosecuting, told Newcastle crown court the farmer and staff were moving a herd of about 140 cattle from winter quarters to summer grazing at the time, using a public path from the farm to a field. Mr Nixon had been standing next to a quad bike and used a stick to stop some of the cattle from moving down the path before he was ready.

But a group of seven or eight cows and five or six calves got past, heading off along the bridleway and over the brow of a hill, out of sight. Meanwhile, Mrs Clode and her family had been out for an afternoon walk whilst staying at holiday cottages on the farm at the time, and were coming in the opposite direction when the cows ran off.

Other family members managed to get out of the way by leaping over a barbed wire fence but Mrs Clode was attacked by a cow which turned 90 degrees towards her as she stood by a wooden gate. Mr Hassall said: ""It charged at her two or three times and then tossed her over the wooden gate.""

Her son-in-law managed to get into the field where she lay unresponsive and face down as they called emergency services. Mr Nixon then arrived at the scene and helped give first aid, the court heard.

The teacher, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, was taken to hospital in Newcastle where she sadly died from her injuries. Evidence from cattle behavioural expert Miriam Parker used in court told how cows had to be e kept under control on public rights of way at all times when being herded along public paths.

The court heard Mr Nixon had travelled on his quad bike along the route he intended to use to move the cows, but that was some time before Mrs Clode and her family were on it. Mr Hassall, referring to Ms Parker's expertise, said: ""Cattle in full-blown fight mode will attack using their head, often repeatedly, and patently that is what transpired here.""

He said cows being moved with their calves would exhibit ""higher arousal levels"" on a spectrum of anxiety, excitement and fear. Even older cattle being moved from their winter sheds to open field can become more excited, play-fighting, prancing and bucking, he said.

Judge Tim Gittins said whether it was a single factor or a combination was not clear, adding: ""Something did trigger the fight reaction."" Mr Hassall replied: ""They are all reasons that might contribute in these particular circumstances to a particular cow going into fight mode rather than flight mode.""

The prosecution said the defendant had not made a ""suitable and sufficient"" assessment of the risk of moving cattle down the public right of way. Tom Gent, for the farm, said the business employed ""experienced and competent"" stockmen.

Mr Nixon did not keep aggressive or over-protective cattle and had got rid of such animals in the past, the firm's barrister said. The court heard he grew up on the farm and employees were well aware that cows could behave more protectively when their calves were with them.

He believed the cattle that bolted would stop to graze on their way to the field, and he did not immediately follow them on his quad bike. Mr Gent said: ""Of course, with the benefit of hindsight, that is something he bitterly, bitterly regrets.""

Judge Gittins will pass sentence at 10am on Friday.

Former BBC Strictly Come Dancing star Helen Skelton has shared her joy after landing a huge new TV role which comes as a drastic change from her Countryfile days

Helen Skelton has announced a brand-new TV gig, and it's a huge career change for the Countryfile star.

Former Strictly Come Dancing star Helen, 40, is gearing up to debut in fan favourite among the kids, Fireman Sam, as the brand-new farming character Annie Morris.

As the beloved kids TV show returns for a new series, Helen's character will be a key member and, with her new character comes a whole new farm. Mum-of-three Helen has revealed her children are huge fans of the cartoon and admitted it feels like an honour to be apart of the brand-new series.

Helen, who quit her BBC5 Live gig earlier this year, said: ""I'm thrilled to be a part of the Fireman Sam family and lend my voice to the spirited character of Farmer Annie Morris. This series is packed with adventures and important life lessons for kids, and I can't wait for everyone to see it.""

The TV star, who is a proud mum to children Ernie, eight, Louis, five, and 19-month-old daughter Elsie, will feature in 26 episodes of the 15th series of Fireman Sam which will debut on Saturday, October 21. Helen's exciting career news come after Helen opened up about her marriage split with Richie Myler for the very first time - admitting she 'still has questions'.

The Strictly Come Dancing star revealed that her stint on the BBC One competition allowed her to grieve her marriage which ended abruptly as she admitted that she was 'blindsided' when Richie announced that he was in a new relationship just a few short months after their split. The TV presenter announced the couple's split in April 2022, taking to Instagram to confirm the news with her online fans.

Skelton, 40, and Leeds Rhinos rugby player, Myler, had welcomed their third child, Elsie, four months before ending the marriage. Helen shocked her followers at the time when she broke the upsetting news on Instagram. ""Very sad to say that Richie and I are no longer a couple. He has left the family home. We will be doing our best to co parent our small children,"" she wrote.

Following their shock split, rugby league player Richie, 34, began dating Stephanie Thirkill - whose millionaire father Andrew Thirkill is president of Richie's club, Leeds Rhinos. Since going public with their romance last year, Richie and Stephanie have welcomed a baby of their own.

In her new autobiography In My Stride, Helen has opened up about the impact that her marriage split left on her, and how she hoped that throwing herself into Strictly rehearsals would take some of the pain away. Helen recalls her rehearsals with Gorka, and how he once asked her why she didn't feel sexy.

""In week two, Gorka asked me why I didn't feel sexy. It was an awkward question that immediately made me cringe. He was asking a woman with three children under six, whose husband had just left her and was with another woman, TO BE SEXY. I thought, ""˜Who would feel good about themselves in that scenario,"" she wrote.

Helen went on to admit that she 'still has questions' over her marriage split - but the Countryfile star is now said to be back on the dating scene, over one year after her split with Richie. And back in August, it was reported that Helen had officially divorced Richie.

Tesco customers will be able to get their hands on the free root veg from December 20, while Morrisons shoppers can take advantage from December 22 - each will run the scheme until December 24

Tesco and Morrisons are giving away free carrots this Christmas to help shoppers ""prepare for Santa and Rudolph"".

Tesco customers will be able to get their hands on the free root veg from December 20, while Morrisons shoppers can take advantage from December 22. Each supermarket will run the scheme until December 24.

The free carrots will be available in 829 larger Tesco stores, while Morrisons will have them in 496 branches. They will be available in stands at the front of stores and shoppers will be able to help themselves. You don't need to make any other purchase.

Kids are traditionally supposed to leave out a mince pie and glass of milk for Santa, plus carrots for Rudolph and his fellow reindeer. But as well as helping families celebrate Christmas, the supermarkets say the move is designed to help reduce food waste.

Andy Todd, carrot buyer at Morrisons said: ""The spirit of giving is what Christmas is all about, and we're thrilled to help add a little bit of magic to our customers' celebrations by giving them a delicious wonky carrot to leave out for Rudolph. Our tasty wonky range helps our British farmers reduce waste and offer customers a delicious alternative at a fraction of the cost.""

Morrisons says its carrots are classed as ""wonky"", meaning they oversized or misshapen, but are still fine to eat. If you don't manage to pick up any freebies, lots of Christmas vegetables normally get reduced this time of year.

Aldi this month kicked off the annual supermarket Christmas price war by slashing the price of some vegetables to 15p, including bags of 2kg white potatoes, 1kg of carrots, 500g of parsnips, red and white cabbages, 500g of brussels sprouts and swedes.

Alongside this, Aldi says the deals this year do not come at the cost of the supplier. This means that growers receive the same price for their product no matter the promotion or offer in-store.

In previous years, some supermarkets including Asda have given away other Christmas vegetables for free, or for as little as 5p, on Christmas Eve to get rid of any excess stock. Of course, this all depends on availability and how much stock each store has left to sell before December 25.

Farmer Hemubhai Makwana, 38, and his wife Hansaben, 35, cut off their own heads with a ""guillotine-like"" contraption before their heads rolled into a ritual fire pit as a human sacrifice to a Hindu god in Rajkot, India

A couple took their own lives by decapitating themselves with a makeshift guillotine, it has emerged.

Police said the bizarre contraption was created so the husband and wife could offer their heads as a sacrifice.

Farmer Hemubhai Makwana, 38, and 35-year-old wife Hansaben ""severed"" their heads from their bodies with a ""guillotine-like mechanism"" in Vinchiya, a village in Rajkot, India.

The heads rolled into a ""fire altar"" as part of a ritual sacrifice.

The suicidal ritual happened between Saturday night and Sunday afternoon, police found.

They left a note for their family who lived nearby, asking their parents to take care of their kids, a son aged 13 and daughter aged 12.

The letter also said they had killed themselves willingly, and that no one else was to blame.

A post-mortem will be carried out and officials have recorded a case of accidental death.

Relatives said the couple had been praying at home every day in the year leading up to their death.

Their children discovered their headless bodies on their farm after returning from their uncle's home.

Vinchiya police sub-inspector Indrajitsinh Jadeja said: ""The couple used a make-shift guillotine to end their lives.

""It is believed that they pulled up the blades of the guillotine themselves and released it in such a manner that their heads fell into a 'havan kund' [ritual fire pit].""

They had turned their home into a temporary temple with grain bags and a picture of the Hindu god Shiva.

""We are recording statements of the family members and trying to know the reason behind the couple's extreme step,"" Jadeja told the Times of India.

Relative Jayanti Jatapar said they had not been involved in any family disputes, nor were they experiencing financial issues.

But the police said their investigation continues.

""We will get a clear picture once we record statements of all the family members,"" Jadeja added.

Former Love Island star Cheyanne took to her Instagram Stories to share her interest for Will Young - who has been struggling to spark a romance in the South African villa

Former Love Island star Cheyanne Kerr has confessed she has the hots for farmer Will Young.

The contestant, who appeared as a Casa Amor bombshell in last year's season, is interested in getting to know Will - who has been having a hard time finding love in the villa.

The South African villa was left reeling from the first recoupling of the winter series, which saw newcomer Tom Clare, 23, couple up with ring girl Olivia Hawkins, 27.

She was originally paired up with Will.

Although he's been struggling to form a connection with the women, former bombshell has her eye on him.

Former contestant Cheyanne took to her Instagram Stories to reveal she wants to get to know him when he leaves the show.

She shared a picture of Will wearing a zebra print bucket hat in bed, which was originally posted on the Love Island page.

She confessed, by writing on top of the picture: ""Secretly hoping Will leaves the villa single.""

It comes after viewers got concerned about the farmer after he was left single and fending for himself.

Even Good Morning Britain star Kate Garraway r eacted to his attempt at getting to know the girls in the villa.

Good Morning Britain played the clip which saw the farmer pull Lana Jenkins, 25, for a chat on the beanbags to explain he was most interested in her in the villa.

Will said: ""I fancy you the most. You're definitely the girl I would go for looks wise.""

Yet Lana said to him: ""I think you're lovely, but I don't think we've really got that spark. Maybe that's just now. At the minute it's not there for me. I would rather be straight with you.""

In the ITV studio, host Kate was left noticeably uncomfortable at the scene as she described it as ""˜brutal'.

She said: ""It's that awful way where they sort of go ""˜right', trying to look like it doesn't matter. It's just heartbreaking.""

Entertainment reporter Richard Arnold replied: ""He's like a little puppy going around there at the moment, isn't he? Our Will.

""The farmer hasn't had the easiest start to life in the villa, but at least there's lots of love for him in the Twitterverse.

""Everybody encouraged Love Island bosses to get a girl in there for him.""

EastEnders is set to air an identity plot involving George Knight on the hit BBC One soap in a new 'challenging' storyline

EastEnders is set to air an identity storyline involving George Knight this New Year.

In upcoming scenes, George, played by Colin Salmon, is set to make a discovery about his identity after his parents reveal the true means by which he was adopted.

This New Year, George's parents Gloria and Eddie, played by Elizabeth Counsell and Christopher Fairbank, arrive in Walford to tell George that he was adopted via a process known as farming, which saw children advertised for money for parents looking to give children a home.

The news leads George to make a discovery about his heritage which causes him to question the identity his parents impressed upon him since his adoption.

However, the secrets are far from over as viewers will soon realise that Gloria and Eddie are not what they seem as it's clear both are still hiding things from their son while Eddie's racist ideologies come to the fore as his fractured relationships with his family are exposed as they challenge him on his views.

As part of the storyline, EastEnders has worked with experts, and a number of people with lived experience of farming to ensure the scenes are handled as sensitively and as accurately as possible.

Talking about the storyline, EastEnders boss, Chris Clenshaw, said: ""EastEnders has a rich history of telling challenging yet truthful stories which reflect past and present events.

""George Knight's storyline will force him to question the identity his parents gave him from childhood as he discovers the true means by which he was adopted.

""It was imperative that we worked with experts and people with lived experience of farming to ensure the storyline is handled as sensitively and as accurately as possible.""

James Bond star Colin Salmon, who is best known for his role as MI6 deputy chief of staff Charles Robinson in three Bond films, plays ""tough-talking and fiercely protective"" father-of-two George, who joined the BBC One soap earlier this year.

Colin said at the time of joining the iconic soap: ""I'm thrilled to be joining the cast of EastEnders to take on the role of George Knight. I'm excited to explore the character of George, a true East End gentleman having been born in the East End myself. I have a great affinity and love for the show and I look forward to being part of the great legacy.""

EastEnders airs Mondays to Thursdays at 7:30pm on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.* Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads.

Dean Standley, a staunchly pro-Putin British financial expert who has lived in Russia for 12 years, was recently arrested by Russian forces. He claims his release came about due to his connections

A British financial expert who has supported Putin's war on Ukraine has claimed he was arrested and jailed by Russian forces.

Dean Standley, 43, said he was arrested while on a visit to an immigration detention centre, where his passport was taken before he was put into a police cell. He claims he then contacted some ""very serious people"" who got him released.

The Solihull resident says he was told the FSB - a Russian security service - was behind his arrest, but that that was ""categorically a lie"". Reports said the FSB were acting on behalf of Interpol following a demand from Malta regarding a criminal investigation. It is reported that Standley is wanted by Interpol.

Standley is believed to advise top Russian individuals and organisations regarding how to avoid Western sanctions. He has appeared in pro-war propaganda videos on Russian state TV - but his links to highly-placed Russians in the Putin regime was not enough to prevent his arrest.

However it did secure his release, he claims. ""Œ""My passport was taken from me in the immigration centre,"" he said. ""One hour later, four or five police, OMON took me from there in a van""¦. detained me, in police cells, in a police station.

""Œ""And that's when I began contacting people that I know in Russia. I can't disclose who those people were. They helped me get out of there in the end, but after 12 hours. I was told that FSB were looking for me, which is categorically a lie. I know the FSB does not work with Interpol""¦even if [they] were looking for a murderer,"" Standley added.

He claims his Moscow ""friends"" sent a lawyer to have him released. ""I was released because of the people I know,"" he said. Standley alleges he was offered to pay a bribe, but declined. Further reports said Standley had to sign a document promising not to leave Russia in return for his freedom - reports which Standley did not confirm.

Standley has lived in Russia for 12 years and openly boasts about his pro-Kremlin views, with a social media bio reading: ""Live in Moscow, Love Russia and work in Financial Economics, for and with Russia."" He works with leading Russian banks such as Alfa Bank, Russian Agricultural Bank, VTB and Gazprom on currency transactions.

""Œ""Because of my education and knowledge, I find legal, not illegal, 100 percent legal ways around the sanctions against the Swift [international money] transfers. And so I've helped numerous people, Russians, with Swift transfers in and out of different jurisdictions.""

He says he is the director of operations and global fund manager at Tower of London Worldwide, ""one of the world's foremost independent financial advisories"". He has been broadcast in Russian state propaganda footage, such as one video of him protesting outside the British Embassy in Moscow

""Œ In another video, the Briton says ""Zelensky you're [done]"" as he mimes cutting his throat. ""Zelensky is an ass****. Americans **** yourselves."" Standley also boasts of knowing Maria Butina, the pro-Putin MP and TV presenter once jailed in the US on espionage charges.

MasterChef star Gregg Wallace will sample some of the UK's first lab-grown meat and see what the public think of it in a new TV show to air tonight on Channel 4

Gregg Wallace will tuck into controversial lab-grown meat in a new TV show, which airs tonight.

The MasterChef star explores the future of food - and a possible answer to rising food costs - by sampling so-called ""˜miracle meat'.

Made from the cells of animals but grown in a lab, its makers claim it is cheaper and tastier than its rivals.

In a trailer for Gregg Wallace: The British Miracle Meat, the 58-year-old is seen visiting a factory where the realistic-looking meat is made.

""Woah!,"" he exclaims as he watches the steak-like chunks on the production line, telling viewers: ""And this is where the magic happens.""

He even gets his celebrity chef pals involved and heads to two-Michelin starred restaurant Le Gavroche in London for a taste test with Michel Roux Jr.

Telling Michel: ""This is a meat I've never seen before"", the pair look to enjoy it as they tuck into the meat on the Channel 4 show.

Co-host Michelle Ackerley also visits Borough Market in the capital to see what the public make of the lab-grown taste.

The programme airs months after scientists in Newcastle revealed they had made a ""game-changing"" breakthrough by cooking and eating a steak entirely grown in a lab.

Made using cells extracted from a pig with no other components needed, creators say the discovery could cut agricultural emissions around the world if rolled out.

Not only are scientists able to make it look like meat, it also replicates the flavour and texture of meat.

Dr Che Connon, Professor of Tissue Engineering at Newcastle University, said it was a ""huge game-changer"" for the industry.

He explained: ""What we have done is produce the world's first 100% meat pork fillet steak.

""What we mean by that is that there's no additional fillers, there's no additional protein or plant protein or anything else to give the meat the structure, which is what has traditionally had to happen before now.""

The professor continued: ""In its raw state, the steak fillet was very similar in appearance to conventional meat with fibres clearly visible.

""On cutting the fillet, it also looked similar to raw conventional meat. The touch in terms of consistency and elasticity and, as with fresh traditional meat, had no obvious aroma while raw.

""Pan-frying, the fillet did shrink, as would be expected with high quality traditional meat. The fillet seared easily and showed the typical charring and crisping on its surface.""

Lab-grown burgers and chicken nuggets have been created by scientists in the past, but all were too expensive to make to become affordable food solutions.

Viewers will have to tune in tonight to see if the latest meat solution has any legs when it comes to cutting food prices and helping save the planet.

Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles have been spotted in Gaza as a ground invasion by the IDF against Palestinians appears to have started. A shocking video captured a tank firing against what looks like a civilian car

An Israeli tank and a bulldozer have been spotted in central Gaza blocking the territory's main north-south highway as the country expands its ground assault.

The Israeli military is edging towards Gaza city in a major escalation of the pummeling attack on the region. The UN has warned ""The social fabric of Gaza is starting to break"". Israel earlier told Palestinians to use the highway to escape the expanding ground offensive. It comes as Israeli troops and armour pushed deeper into northern and central Gaza on Monday.

The video shows a car approaching an earth barrier across the road. The car stops and turns around. As it heads away, the tank appears to open fire, and an explosion engulfs the car.

Witnesses that spoke to AFP also said that tanks were seen in the Zaytun district. They noted: ""They have cut the Salahedin road and are firing at any vehicle that tries to go along it."" It is not confirmed yet whether the witnesses' statements are directly related to the incident captured in the video.



A journalist reporting for Middle Eastern news network Saudi Research and Media Group, posted the video on his X (Twitter) account and captioned it as such: ""Israeli army and tanks are now in the very vital and important Salah Al Din road in the Gaza Strip.""

Ahmed Maher went on to explain: ""It's the main highway and stretches 45km along the strip, starting from the Erez crossing in the North to the Rafah crossing in the South. This means that the Israeli army has indeed divided the North from the South through Erez crossing, which is militarily an area of weakness to Hamas and the Palestinian factions.

""In this video, taken by Palestinian photojournalist Hossam Al Saifi, a journalist says ""˜they are shooting at a whole family', as the driver of the car at the end was trying to escape the scene. The Palestinian journalists then started speeding off quickly, as one of them was shouting loudly to warn other civilian cars not to approach this area. Poor Israeli military rules of engagement on the ground if it turned out they opened fire at a civilian car.""

When asked whether forces had positioned on the road, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said ""we expanded our operations"" but would not comment on specific deployments.

The Israeli advances put their forces on both sides of Gaza City and the surrounding areas of northern Gaza, in what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a ""second stage"" in the war ignited by Hamas' brutal Oct. 7 incursion. Casualties on both sides are expected to rise sharply as Israeli forces and Palestinian militants battle in dense residential areas.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians remain in the north and would no longer be able to escape if the north-south highway is blocked. Around 117,000 displaced people are staying in hospitals in northern Gaza, alongside thousands of patients and staff, hoping they will be safe from strikes, according to U.N. figures.

Most residents heeded Israel's orders to flee to the southern part of the besieged territory, but many stayed in part because Israel has also bombarded targets in so-called safe zones.

The death toll among Palestinians passed 8,000, mostly women and minors, the Gaza Health Ministry said. The toll is without precedent in decades of Israeli-Palestinian violence. More than 1.4 million people in Gaza have fled their homes. Over 1,400 people have died on the Israeli side, mainly civilians killed during Hamas' initial attack, also an unprecedented figure.

Israeli forces appeared to be driving deeper into Gaza from the north. Video released Monday by the military showed armoured vehicles moving among buildings and soldiers taking positions inside a house.

The military said Monday that overnight its troops had killed dozens of militants who attacked from inside buildings and tunnels and that strikes had destroyed a building Hamas was using as a staging post. It said that in the last few days, it had struck more than 600 militant targets, including weapons depots and anti-tank missile launching positions. The reports of targeting could not be independently confirmed.

Hamas' military wing said its militants clashed with Israeli troops who entered the northwest Gaza Strip with small arms and anti-tank missiles. Palestinian militants have continued firing rockets into Israel, including toward its commercial hub, Tel Aviv.

Senior UN official Thomas White, the director of UNRWA Affairs in Gaza, spoke of the critical situation they are facing due to the shortage of fuel. According to his statement, the shortage of fuel is leading to reduced services, including access to drinking water, potential closure of bakeries, and the inability to operate essential facilities such as hospitals' ICUs.

White said: ""We're running out of fuel. We are now reducing the fuel we're using every day so that we can keep the most critical services running for as long as possible. But it is going to mean that people don't have access to drinking water. If we can't get fuel to the bakeries, they're going to close down, and really critically, you know, hospitals that are full of patients, they will not be able to run their ICU, for example.""

He added: ""The social fabric of Gaza is starting to break. [This] can be very dangerous for - not only the people living here - but also makes it very difficult for us to maintain our aid operation on warehouses that we have in Gaza and [people] effectively looted those warehouses. I think it's an indication of how desperate people are.""

The latest Sunday Times Rich List shows King Charles has a £600milion personal fortune and is the 263rd richest person in the UK, with Gopi Hinduja at number one with £35 billion

King Charles' wealth far exceeds his late mother's at more than £600 million, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.

The latest figures show Gopi Hinduja and his family are the richest people in the UK with a wealth of £35billion.

The Hinduja family - who are behind the Indian conglomerate Hinduja Group - topped the list for the second year in a row as their fortune jumped by more than £6 billion.

Further down at number 263, the list shows the King is sitting on a personal net worth of £600 million, which is nearly double that of the Queen.

Last year the late monarch's was calculated at £370 million.

Earlier this year it was reports the King has built a huge fortune from his own property assets and from building housing developments that made him become a major landlord over the years.

The monarch's most valuable assets are Sandringham with its 20,000 acres and Balmoral, which is surrounded by 50,000 acres.

Sandringham has belonged to the royals for more than 160 years, it has 300 buildings and a grade II listed mansion.

Last year, property firm McCarthy Stone valued the principal residence at £55 million - and the whole estate could be worth around £245 million, according to agricultural land values supplied by estate agent Strutt & Parker.

Prince Albert acquired Balmoral for Queen Victoria in 1852 and the Scottish castle is valued at £60 million.

It is surrounded by mountains, forests, lochs and grouse moors totalling 50,000 acres - with each acre worth between £600 and £1,800.

It is also surrounded by 150 other buildings including Birkhall, a house that Charles used for more than 20 years.

In total, the castle and wider estate are estimated to be worth around £120million.

Meanwhile, Charles has doubled revenues he achieves through rentals on property owned by the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster.

While Charles built a sustainable development in Dorset and began a similar project in Cornwall in the 1990s, the duchy was pushing up its income from renting commercial properties in London, Milton Keynes and Cornwall - almost doubling to £17.6million over the past decade.

Meanwhile Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is currently in a battle to take control of Manchester United, is this year's highest climber and comes in second place with an estimated fortune of £29.7billion.

For the first time in 14 years, the number of billionaires on the list fell by six - meaning there are now 171 billionaires in the UK.

But combined, their wealth grew by an eye-watering £30.73billion - against a backdrop of the cost of living crisis.

These are the 20 richest people and families in the UK, according to the Rich List:

It comes as the poultry industry says the situation is at 'breaking point' as producers struggle to cope with soaring energy bills and packaging prices that have left the system ""unsustainable""

Supermarket shelves are being stripped of the much-loved British roast chicken over supply shortages.

It comes as the poultry industry says the situation is at 'breaking point' as producers struggle to cope with soaring energy bills and packaging prices that have left the system ""unsustainable.""

The British Poultry Council has warned the sector is ""at breaking point"" unless supermarkets increase the prices they are paying for birds.

Fruit and vegetables stocks could also be hit as record temperatures in Spain and the Mediterranean region have made growing conditions difficult with the fallout hitting UK imports.

In Britain, a prolonged cold winter has spelled a late start to the growing season for native arable farmers, meaning double trouble for fruit and veg buyers.

The perfect storm of bad weather and soaring energy costs mean in the coming months customers could see less available for the weekly shop.

Poultry Council chief executive Richard Griffiths, told the Mail Online: ""The drive to keep food affordable under exceptional market conditions where the cost of production is not being returned through the marketplace is rendering poultry meat businesses unviable.""

Mr Griffiths said issues like avian flu, as well as ongoing wrangles around Brexit, meant his members were struggling to get prices for their products that reflected the challenges they faced.

The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said the growing season for British farmers had started later because of a prolonged cold winter.

The organisation also claimed recent food shortages reflected the UK's reliance on imported fruit and veg.

Christine McDowell, from the NFU, said a rise in production costs has added to the problem.

She said: ""British growers continue to face significant cost increases, such as energy and labour, and many simply can't afford to keep producing food with the current returns.""

The Spanish government has requested emergency funds from the European Union to support farmers and ranchers amid extreme drought conditions in the country's agricultural heartlands.

668,"Frog species discovered is named after Lord of the Rings because it looks like an orc","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/frog-species-discovered-named-after-29247740","Frog species discovered is named after Lord of the Rings because it looks like an orc

A new frog species has been discovered deep in the mountains of Ecuador, and it was named after the author of Lord of the Rings, JRR Tolkien, because its colours make it look similar to an orc

Scientists named the cute frog Hyloscirtus tolkieni , in honour of JRR Tolkien - creator of the Middle-Earth world that features in the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.

The amazing colours of the stream frog reminded the scientists of a creature from Tolkien's world, which is famously known for its terrifying depiction of orcs.

The new species has a greyish/green back with yellow spots, as well as pale pink eyes with a black iris.

The underside of its body is largely golden yellow with black spots, while its fingers and toes have broad black and yellow stripes.

Diego F. Cisneros-Heredia, director of the Museum of Zoology of the Universidad San Francisco de Quito USFQ, said: ""The new species of frog has amazing colours, and it would seem that it lives in a universe of fantasies, like those created by Tolkien.

""The truth is that the tropical Andes are magical ecosystems where some of the most wonderful species of flora, funga, and fauna in the world are present.

""Unfortunately, few areas are well protected from the negative impacts caused by humans. Deforestation, unsustainable agricultural expansion, mining, invasive species, and climate changes are seriously affecting Andean biodiversity.""

Hyloscirtus tolkieni is a type of stream frog; a group of ambient that live in the Andes of Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia.

They tend to live most of their lives close to fresh running water in the mountains, hovering around the rocky shores' plants.

Their young tadpoles also grow up among the rocks of rapid rivers - although there's not a great deal scientists know about this particular species of stream frog.

Hyloscirtus tolkieni has only ever been spotted by one research group, which means there's only one set of information about it.

In fact, the national park where the scientists found the species was so vast, that they were trekking for weeks to find one Hyloscirtus tolkieni .

The RÃ­o Negro-Sopladora National Park in Ecuador - and the Andes in general - could hold numerous undiscovered animals. But, human-induced destruction increases the risk of these species becoming extinct before they're even spotted for the first time.

More than half of all amphibian species in Ecuador are already threatened with extinction.

18 more cases of salmonella poisoning has been reported in the US as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration advise to stay away from cantaloupe, the fruit that has been linked to the outbreak

Consumers have been warned to steer clear of cantaloupe melons sold at certain stores after 18 more cases of salmonella poisoning were reported amid a broader outbreak.

As some brands of cantaloupe were recalled earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration urge people in America to clear the melons from their diets until the outbreak is contained. The agencies continue to add to the ever-growing list of stores that recalled the fruit.

Cantaloupe has been linked to at least two fatalities, 117 illnesses and 64 hospitalisations in 34 states, according to the CDC. Eighteen illnesses have been reported since last week. ""The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses,"" the C.D.C. said adding that it typically takes three to four weeks to determine whether an illness is linked to an outbreak.

Pre-cut cantaloupe, sold at major grocery stores Kroger, Trader Joe's and Sprouts Farmer Market has joined the do-not-buy list. Health officials said customers should also eschew buying pre-cut cantaloupe at Aldi, Kwik Trip, Freshness Guaranteed, RaceTrac, Vineyard and Bix Produce, according to NBC.

The CDC'S recommendation to avoid whole cantaloupes from the brands Malichita or Rudy still stands as it advises consumers to not eat pre-cut versions of the fruit if they are unaware of which brand it came from. You should also wash anything that has touched the recalled fruit.

Salmonella is a food-borne bacterium that ravages the intestines of people and animals, according to the CDC. Other than ingesting contaminated foods or water, people can get infected by touching afflicted animals, their poo or environment Those infected with salmonella will likely experience diarrhoea, fever and stomach cramps anywhere from six hours to six days after ingesting the bacteria.

The infection, which is treated with antibiotics in extreme cases, is said to be harsher against young children, older adults and those with weakened immune systems.

Salmonella accounts for most illnesses related to food reported in the United States, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Roughly 1.35 million people are reportedly afflicted with the illness each year. More than 400 people die from the illness annually. The bacteria can grow rapidly in uncooked meats, however, the most recent outbreaks have been traced back to a plethora of foods, like diced onions, alfalfa sprouts, cookie dough and peanut butter.

Last month, peaches, nectarines and plums were linked to a listeria outbreak that caused one death.

Seven people have been charged following the major policing operation in central London on Saturday. Investigations continue into a number of other incidents.

Officers made 145 arrests during the Pro-Palestinian demonstration and counter protest by right-wing groups for offences including assault, possession of weapons, criminal damage, public order, inciting racial hatred and possession of drugs.

The charges so far follow investigations led by detectives from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command and the Public Order Crime Team.

Suella Braverman finally thanks police officers hours later

Home Secretary Suella Braverman has finally thanked the ""brave police officers"" after yesterday's protests.

All day politicians have criticised Ms Braverman for her failure to comment after being accused of stoking tensions ahead of the Armistice Day protests yesterday.

Her following comment failed to mention the far-right ""counter-protesters"" who made up the majority of the arrests.

She wrote on Twitter: ""Our brave police officers deserve the thanks of every decent citizen for their professionalism in the face of violence and aggression from protesters and counter protesters in London yesterday. That multiple officers were injured doing their duty is an outrage.

""The sick, inflammatory and, in some cases, clearly criminal chants, placards and paraphernalia openly on display at the march mark a new low. Antisemitism and other forms of racism together with the valorising of terrorism on such a scale is deeply troubling.

""This can’t go on. Week by week, the streets of London are being polluted by hate, violence, and antisemitism. Members of the public are being mobbed and intimidated. Jewish people in particular feel threatened. Further action is necessary""

Leader of the SNP accused of 'disrespecting' war dead by not singing natinal anthem

The leader of the Scottish National Party in Westminster has been accused of disrespect after refusing sing the national anthem at the Cenotaph earlier.

Flynn was silent as other political leaders, including Rishi Sunak, Keir Starmer, and former prime ministers, sang God Save the King.

The Telegraph reported that in previous years, Ian Blackford - Flynn's predecessor - sang along with the anthem.

Yvette Cooper 'shocked' by Rishi Sunak's failure to thank police

Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, says she was ""shocked"" that the UK prime minister failed to thank police officers for the 126 arrests made during yesterday's chaotic day of protests.

Speaking to Sky, she said the government was making it ""harder for the police to do their jobs"".

Ms Cooper had earlier slammed her Tory counterpart who is being blamed for stoking up tensions between left and right wing protesters ahead of Armistice Day.

Liz Truss cropped out of image of former PMs

Former Prime Minister Theresa May has shared a photo of former Prime Ministers together at the Cenotaph - with one figure missing.

Mrs May posted an image on Twitter showing Boris Johnson, herself, David Cameron, Gordon Brown, Sir Tony Blair and Sir John Major earlier today. But it was quickly spotted that flash-in-pan PM Liz Truss had been cropped out.

Eagle-eyed users were quick to spot this. One posted: ""Theresa May cropping Liz Truss out the ex-PMs photo is very, very funny."" Another wrote: ""Thank you for cropping out Liz Truss. Next time get Boris out too.""

It is unclear whether this was deliberate. Alongside the picture of the six former PMs, which also features current incumbent Rishi Sunak, Mrs May wrote: ""Each year on Remembrance Sunday, we assemble at the Cenotaph to honour the sacrifice of the fallen and pay tribute to the servicemen & women we place in harm’s way. Today - as every day - we will remember them.""

Grant Shapps fails to back Suella Braverman's survival as Home Secretary

As Suella Braverman remains under fire for stoking tensions ahead of Armistice Day protests, the Defence Secretary Grant Shapps stayed on the fence and refused to comment on his colleague's position.

Speaking to Sky News, Mr Shapps said: “As you know, and I know well, a week’s a long time in politics. I never make predictions about these things.”

“The make-up of the Cabinet is entirely a matter for the Prime Minister.

“He will decide that in his own time.”

Meanwhile, Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Ms Braverman's comments undermined her position and she can't stay in the job.

She blamed the ugly scenes in London on Mrs Braverman’s “appalling and unprecedented attack” on the Metropolitan Police’s operational independence and impartiality.

“I don’t see how she can continue to do this job, she does not have the credibility or the authority to do the serious job of Home Secretary,” Ms Cooper said.

""They will remain in the area throughout the day for the reassurance of all who will be coming to pay their respects. If you are in the area and notice anything unusual or suspicious please do not hesitate to speak to officers. In an emergency, dial 999.""

Why Kate Middleton wore three poppies to emotional Remembrance Day ceremony at Cenotaph

The Princess of Wales stood alongside Queen Camilla at today's moving Remembrance Day service at the Cenotaph in Whitehall to pay tribute to the war dead. While Kate looked incredibly elegant as she watched from the balcony of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, many fans questioned why she was wearing three poppies.

Unlike King Charles and other members of the Royal Family who wore one simple poppy on their uniforms, Kate added several of the flowers and a diamond brooch to her outfit to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the World Wars and other conflicts.

Despite never being confirmed by the palace, one theory is that the royals wear multiple brooches in honour of family members who have fought and died in wars.

Man started repairing Liverpool's bomb damage as a child

It's been almost 80 years since Liverpool as it was known to a generation became unrecognisable as World War II took its toll.

Many from the area went to war, buildings were destroyed, families were separated and the impact was still seen in the years to follow. Stories of this time continue to be passed down through the generations but fewer and fewer experienced what life was like then in Liverpool.

Born on March 10, 1926, Ernie Gaskell, now 97, was one of thousands of children who had their education disrupted and saw the Liverpool they had grown up in change before their eyes. As a teenager Ernie, from Kirkdale, began working and repairing bomb damage in the city and further afield, before volunteering for the Royal Navy.

""I left school at 13 on account of the war starting and my education finished then. When I was 14 , I started working, repairing bomb damage in Liverpool. The bomb damage was terrible, "" he told the ECHO.

""I remember twice being in the cinema watching a film and there being air raids. I went to watch a film with my good friend George and there was a huge explosion.

""The cinema filled with smoke and a notice came on the screen - ridiculous as it sounds - saying you could stay to watch the film and most people did. It wasn't until we stepped outside that we saw the wreckage.

""We found out later two girls queuing at the box office were killed. Another time when we came out and we were looking down from Walton where we were - Liverpool seemed to be on fire.""

Village pays tribute to only man to die in WWI as family receive stolen medal replicas

A village came together yesterday to honour its only fallen son from World War One - with his family in attendance to receive recreations of his stolen medals.

Private Jesse Levett died in combat in 1918, aged 20 - the only resident of Arlington, East Sussex to lose his life in the Great War.

Sadly the young soldier's medals were stolen from St Pancras Church in the village during the 1970s.

But, after the efforts of the Arlington Museum, Pvt Levett's descendants now have recreations of his service medals.

The honours were presented to 18 of his relatives: five from Hereford; four from Carmarthen in Wales; three from Wellingborough; three from Chichester; and three more from Steyning in Sussex.

PM's statement on 'hard-earned' peace

In a statement marking today's Remembrance Sunday ceremony, Rishi Sunak has said ""recent events"" show we cannot take our peace for granted.

“The courage and commitment shown by our servicemen and women, both today and throughout the generations that came before them, is humbling and I know many across the country will be honouring their memory today in quiet reflection,"" the prime minister said.

“Recent events have served as a stark reminder that we cannot take the hard-earned peace we live in for granted, which is why I am honoured to lay a wreath on behalf of the nation in the memory of all those that have lost their lives defending our country and the values we hold so close.

“I am determined to ensure we never forget the ultimate sacrifice they have made.”

Suella Braverman lays wreath at Cenotaph 24 hours after it was stormed by thugs she's accused of inciting

Dithering Rishi Sunak is still weighing up whether to sack the Home Secretary after she penned a scathing attack on police chiefs. Despite the controversy she stood alongside war heroes, the King, the PM and senior colleagues as the nation fell silent to remember the fallen.

Yesterday far-right ""counter protesters"" clashed with police at the memorial in Whitehall. Critics have blamed Ms Braverman for inciting the thugs by claiming force bosses show a ""double standard"" in the way left and right wing protesters are treated.

Scuffles broke out as police attempted to stop a crowd of people carrying St George's flags marching along Embankment towards Whitehall, where the Cenotaph is located, shortly after 10am. The group, which had been chanting ""England till I die"" pushed through the police barrier, with some shouting ""let's have them"" as officers hit out with batons. Some chanted anti-Islamic slurs.

London mayor Sadiq Khantold The Sunday Mirror : ""The scenes we witnessed involving the far right were a direct result of the Home Secretary's words and behaviour. The vast majority of the over 300,000 pro-Palestinian protesters estimated to have marched were peaceful, but the police also had to deal with completely unacceptable behaviour from some, including antisemitism.""

Major Royal Family member misses Cenotaph Remembrance

The Duke of Kent, 88, missed today's Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph and will stay at home due to ""episodic mobility problems."" His equerry, Captain George Hopkins of the Scots Guards, lay a wreath on his behalf today.

Prince Edward also missed the Festival of Remembrance last night at the Royal Albert Hall, which was attended by senior royals.

Meaning behind the Cenotaph

The Cenotaph, which stands proud in the centre of Whitehall, was designed as an empty tomb.

Its creators said that the absence inside would allow families, friends, comrades and colleagues to fill it with their own memories of those who lost their lives while serving.

Limbless veterans and Chelsea ""in-pensioners"" salute as they march past

Veterans who lost their limbs in conflict have also just marched past the Cenotaph, many of them on mobility scooters.

They were followed by the ""in-pensioners"" of the Royal Chelsea Hospital.

Some of those who were unable to walk and in wheelchairs were pushed along by their comrades.

Veterans and serving forces march past Cenotaph

The thousands-strong march of current and former armed forces personnel were seen marching past and saluting the Cenotaph in memory of the war dead today.

One of the main parts of today's remembrance service is the opportunity for veterans to pay their respects.

The Irish Guards, Gurkhas, Scots Guards and Grenadier Guards are among the companies that have already marched past.

Liz Truss among prime ministers stood at the Cenotaph

Seven living former Prime Ministers today stood at the Cenotaph - the largest number in history.

For the second year in a row Liz Truss, Boris Johnson, Theresa May, David Cameron, Gordon Brown, Sir Tony Blair and Sir John Major lined up for the national Remembrance Sunday service on Whitehall, led by the King. It is convention for former Prime Ministers to attend the service in memory of the nation’s war dead.

However, the number of surviving ex-premiers has swelled after seven years of turmoil which has had five occupants of 10 Downing. Ms Truss occupies an unusual place in their ranks, as her 49-day premiership - the shortest in British history - was so brief that she never laid a wreath on the Cenotaph as PM.

Other royals laid wreaths including Prince William and Princess Anne

Other royals that lay wreaths at the base of the monument were Prince William. His wreath featured the white Prince of Wales feathers and bears a ribbon in ""Welsh red"". Prince Edward and Princess Anne also laid wreaths, while Sophie, the Duchess of Edinburgh, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester watched from the Foreign Office.

Kate's three poppies could be to remember lost family members

While the reason the Princess of Wales always chooses to wear several poppies to Remembrance events has never been revealed, many believe the reason stems from her wish to pay tribute to lost family members. Kate's great-grandmother had three brothers who were all killed in action during World War One and the Princess had the opportunity to view letters from her ancestors during an emotional visit to the Imperial War Museum in 2018.

Other female members of the Royal Family often choose to do the same. The late Queen would famously wear a collection of five poppies to the Cenotaph which many believed was her way of paying tribute to the five branches of service, these include: the Army, the Royal Navy and the RAF.

Sombre Kate Middleton wears three poppies as she joins Queen Camilla for Remembrance

A solemn Princess of Wales wore three poppies as she joined Queen Camilla as they paid their respects on Remembrance Sunday.

The two women took their traditional spot on a balcony of the Foreign Office, which overlooks the Cenotaph in Central London, to watch the emotional service. Both wrapped up against the chilly weather in elegant black coats and hats, with both wearing pearl jewellery.

Unlike King Charles and other members of the Royal Family who wore one simple poppy on their uniforms, Kate added several of the flowers to her outfit to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the World Wars and other conflicts.

King Charles III leaves Cenotaph to escort royals back to foreign office

With a salute, King Charles III has left the Cenotaph and will escort the royal family back to the foreign and commonwealth development office.

He is followed by members of the clergy and government representatives. The former prime ministers followed behind the current lawmakers.

National anthem God Save the King played at base of the Cenotaph

Those gathered at the base of the Cenotaph are currently singing the national anthem.

Prayer service begins

The Lord Bishop of London Sarah Mullaly is currently speaking as part of a short prayer service for the fallen war dead.

Ireland and Nepal last of countries to lay wreaths

The ambassadors of Ireland and Nepal - who've had a unique relationship with the British Armed Forces - were the two last countries to lay wreaths this morning.

At some points in history, as many as a forty per cent of Army recruits were from Ireland.

The Gurkhas from Nepal were admired by the British armed forces for their military abilities and honourable tactics. They first recruited in 1815. Nepal is considered Britain's ""oldest ally"" in Asia.

Commonwealth countries lay their wreaths

We're currently seeing a number of current and former Commonwealth countries laying their wreaths at the foot of the Cenotaph.

Many of the countries lost huge amounts of citizens fighting in the world wars and during the conflicts that followed.

The National Television Awards got off to an awkward start, with This Morning and Piers Morgan hit with a round of boos as Joel Dommett opened the show before an unexpected Phillip Schofield cameo

Television's most glamorous night's of the year got off to an awkward start at London's O2 Arena for tonight's National Television Awards - with Phillip Schofield later making a brief on-screen cameo at one point.

But before an award was even handed out, things got tense as host Joel Dommett gave This Morning a shout out - saying ""everyone loves"" the ITV show - only for the room to be filled with a chorus of boos. Piers Morgan also got a harsh welcome from those inside the arena.

Things only got worse for the This Morning team later in the evening, as BBC series The Repair Shop toppled the once untouchable weekday show to take home the honour of being crowned the nation's favourite TV show - after 13 years of This Morning winning the award.

Former Made in Chelsea star Sam Thompson was one of the first to arrive on the red carpet earlier this evening, with the boyfriend of Strictly Come Dancing contestant Zara McDermott cutting both a sharp and laidback look as he teamed a traditional black tux with a pair of Crocs.

Maya Jama warned fans this afternoon she may miss out on the red carpet thank to leaving her glam ""so late"", while Holly Willoughby was all smiles as she arrived at a hotel to get ready ahead of the NTAs earlier today - soon after it was revealed her former This Morning co-host Phillip Schofield has unfollowed her from Instagram.

Happy Valley has already cleaned up throughout the night, with the BBC series crowned the nation's favourite returning drama and lead actress Sarah Lancashire picking up the prize for best dramatic performance gong and a special recognation award - baffling host Josh and viewers watching at ITV with her real accent as she accepted her first prize.

Poor Holly

This year’s NTAs are now done and dusted - leaving viewers free to gossip about the broadcast and discuss some of the awkward moments from the evening. You can catch up on the full list of winners here.

It’s been a rough ride for Holly over recent months, thanks to the This Morning presenter’s former friend and co-host Schofield’s string of scandals. As the mum-of-three’s ITV show lost its daytime TV crown earlier this year, fans watching at home suspected the Dancing On Ice host had a tear in her eye.

Taking to Twitter, one fan wrote: ""We all know Holly Willoughby is fuming #NTAs,"" whilst another added: ""Holly looks close to tears."" A third shared: ""Holly looks likes she’s about to burst into tears when the repair shop won the award #NTAs.""

EastEnders reign supreme in soap world

EastEnders finished off a successful night at the NTAs as they collected the final award of the evening, best serial drama.

The BBC soap took home three soap prizes in total, with Strictly Come Dancing contestant Bobby Brazier giving an emotional speech as he accepted the gong for rising star, and it was a big win for Danielle Harold, who played the late Lola Pearce-Brown, as she was declared the best serial drama performance.

Amy Dowden takes to the stage

The NTAs penultimate award has gone to Strictly Come Dancing - with the inspirational Amy Dowden joining her fellow dancers on stage to accept the trophey.

Amy has been staying positive and keeping fans updated on her health since sharing her cancer news in July, but recently disclosed how ""doctors and nurses were telling me I had sepsis and that it was life-threatening"" two days after chemotherapy treatment on 3 August.

Thankfully, Amy was fit enough to join her colleagues at the NTAs this evening - with one of her fellow pros giving her a shout out as the Strictly team gave a speech before being cut off by host Joel due to timing.

This Morning LOSE daytime TV crown

This Morning is no longer the nation’s favourite daytime TV programme, with the ITV show losing its crown to BBC series The Repair Shop.

Not all of the This Morning team are currently inside the O2 Arena to grin and bear the defeat in front of the cameras, following bosses being accused of failing to invite backroom staff to the NTAs amid the cost of living crisis.

It was claimed by a source that ITV didn’t think it was going to be “a stellar year” for This Morning and it turns out their fears were correct - with the long-running show missing out on the award for the first time in years after being booed at the start of the show.

This year’s NTAs is the first one since Schofield’s dramatic exit from ITV earlier this year. Schofield, 61, resigned from ITV and was dropped by his talent agency YMU in May after admitting to an ""unwise but not illegal"" relationship with a younger male colleague on the show. Prior to admitting the workplace affair, Schofield quit This Morning days before making the revelation.

Queen Sarah

Sarah Lancashire’s night is getting even better, with the iconic British actress being honoured with a special recognition award to take home with her alongside the gong she picked up earlier in the evening.

“You have no idea what it’s like to have so many lovely things said about you by so many people you love and admire,” Sarah began as she accepted her second award of the night, with the crowd chanting her name as she took to the stage again.

Those watching the NTAs on ITV are delighted the talented star is getting her flowers, with one declaring on Twitter: “Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the remarkable, brilliant and magical career of Sarah Lancashire. It's Sarah's night tonight, and we are all NOT worthy of her brilliance.

Another added: “For all you soap snobs, a reminder that Sarah Lancashire made a name for herself in Coronation Street and is now one of the finest actors in television. And there are many other examples. Soaps are a fantastic training ground and demand so much from their casts. #NTAs.”

“This really is Sarah Lancashire’s night, f***ing thrilled for her #ntas,” one Twitter user simply but perfectly put.

Lewis Capaldi's message from America

Lewis Capaldi sent an emotional message to fans as he won the Best Authored Documentary at the National Television Awards.

The singer - who is currently on a break from his career amid struggles with his mental wellbeing - was up in the Documentary category alongside Deborah James: Bowelbabe In Her Own Words, Matt Willis: Fighting Addiction and Rob Burrow: Living with MND.

In a pre-recorded message, Lewis paid tribute to his fellow nominees and explained how he was currently in America. Lewis won for his documentary Lewis Capaldi: How I'm Feeling Now, which documents his incredible rise to fame and how he copes with the pressures of his success.

Paul O'Grady fans in tears

Fans of the late, great Paul O’Grady are in tears following a dog accepting the iconic entertainer’s award six months on from his death.

The much loved comedian and TV star was nominated for an award for his series For the Love of Dogs. It was shortlisted in the Factual category for an 11th year in a row. Paul's programme was up against Jeremy Clarkson's show Clarkson's Farm, Stacey Solomon's Sort Your Life Out and The Martin Lewis Money Show Live. A team from Battersea and a dog, who stole the show, accepted the award. One viewer said: ""That Dog making just as much noise as Paul would. He would be proud."" Another added: ""This dog omg is stealing the show. Love this. Paul O’Grady was marvellous. Sadly missed.""

Someone else commented: ""Crying my eyes out at Paul o Grady : for the love of dogs winning an award at the #NTAs."" Family, friends and fans of the beloved Lily Savage icon were left devastated in March when he died at 67 from sudden cardiac arrhythmia. He had spoken openly about his health battles with heart disease, having endured three heart attacks before the age of 65. The final episodes of Paul's For the Love of Dogs aired soon after his death - leaving viewers in tears.

Ant and Dec win... again

Ant and Dec have continued their National Television Awards winning streak as they scooped the Best Presenter gong for the 22nd year in a row.

At the 2023 ceremony, the lads scooped the prize yet again – adding another award to their seemingly unstoppable collection and continuing the suggestion that other stars shouldn’t even bother trying to overthrow them. The presenting duo – which consists of 47-year-olds Antony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly – won their first NTA back in 2001 when they were crowned Most Popular Entertainment Presenters for their work on weekend morning kids entertainment show SMTV Live.

Always next year for the other presenters...

Schofield cameo!

ITV will have tried their best to prevent Phillip Schofield’s name cropping up during tonight’s ceremony, but the former This Morning presenter made a very brief cameo as the NTAs remembered Paul O’Grady.

During a montage of the late entertainer’s TV work over the years, including clips from his Channel 4 chat show and his iconic moments as drag queen Lily Savage, Schofield popped up in the background from a past NTAs event. The awkward moment occurred as the montage showed Paul receiving a special award, with Schofield and two other stars also nominated.

Sarah Lancashire's accent surprises viewers - and host Joel

No-one will be surprised to learn Sarah Lancashire has scooped the best drama performance award for her powerful portrayal of Catherine Cawood in Happy Valley, but ITV viewers have been left baffled by her accent.

“Hearing Sarah Lancashire's actual accent and not her Yorkshire accent is jarring. #NTAs #NTAs2023,” one quipped on Twitter as Sarah gave an emotional acceptance speech in quite a posh accent.

Another added: “Wasn’t expecting to hear Sarah Lancashire speaking with a very posh accent there #NTAs.” Host Joel didn’t expect to hear what came out of Sarah’s mouth either, with the presenter admitting he was surprised to hear the former Corrie star’s real accent.

Awards round up

Another ad break so time for a quick round up on who has an award so far. Hit series Happy Valley has taken home the returning drama prize, with actress Sarah Lancashire confirming there will not be another series of the drama.

Speaking in the winner’s room, the former Corrie star said: “It was a story told as a trilogy which has been a great way to tell a story arch. The danger is you carry on and it losses its potency but I think this way it keeps it on top.”

New reality TV show on the block The Traitors beat the likes of Love Island to take home the prize for best reality competition and Gogglebox took home the first award of the night, The Bruce Forsyth Entertainment Award.

Piers admits he thought he would win

Piers Morgan said that people would “rather shoot themselves” than give him an award at the NTAs moments before being beaten by Graham Norton.

He said: “They’d all rather shoot themselves then give me an award but, but if it’s just on interviews, hard to say that anyone else has had bigger ones that we’ve had in the last year.” Speaking about how he might fair in his category, he added: “I don’t have any competition.”

Awkward

Parky tribute

Before Clive Myrie took to the stage to announce who has won the best TV interview trophy, host Joel paid tribute to the late Sir Michael Parkinson, who passed away last month.

Michael died at home on 16 August 2023 following a brief illness, aged 88.Tributes from across the world poured in for the iconic chat show host following his passing.

After the sweet tribute from Joel, Clive announced BBC star Graham Norton was the winner of the award - leaving Piers, fresh from Joel’s jibe, trophy-less.

Piers mocked by Joel

It’s an ad break but next up is the award for best TV interview, which will see Piers Morgan’s “uncensored” show take on Louis Theroux Interviews, The Chris and Rosie Ramsay Show and The Graham Norton Show.

Before cutting for commercials, host Joel cheekily told Piers “don’t be walking out of this interview as you’re in this one” - poking fun at the former Good Morning Britain anchor storming off set when called out for his comments on Meghan Markle last year.

And the winner is""¦

After the awkwardness of booing, it was time to present the first award of the evening, The Bruce Forsyth Entertainment Award.

Gogglebox beat Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway, I’m a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here! And The Masked Singer to be crowned the winners! Accepting the gong on stage, Lee Riley paid tribute to his co-stars who have passed away over recent months.

Coming as no surprise to those watching on ITV this evening, Happy Valley was then crowned the best returning drama and beating off competition from Call the Midwife, Stranger Things and Vera. The crime series starring national treasure Sarah Lancashire came to an end at the start of the year after three critically acclaimed series.

You can keep up with the full list of winners (and losers) here.

Boooooooo

While Joel is making jokes, it’s not all positive vibes so far with This Morning getting a small boo as Joel claimed “we all love” the ITV programme. The This Morning crew weren’t the only ones not going down well with the crowd inside London’s O2 Arena, with Piers Morgan attracting an even louder boo when getting a shout out from Joel.

And we're off....

Host Joel is on stage and this year’s NTAs have officially begun - kicking off the evening with a cheeky jibe at his own expense, joking he looks like a waiter.

The Masked Singer presenter also poked fun at Ant and Dec’s long-running success in the best presenter category, before going on to mention his wife is currently nine months pregnant.

“If my wife’s waters do break, Ant and Dec are on hand to take her straight to the hospital - I’m a baby, get me out of hereeeeeee!” Joel joked in his opening monologue

Bobby Brazier talks Strictly

EastEnders actor Bobby Brazier, who is up for the rising star award at tonight’s NTAs, caught up with the Mirror on the red carpet this evening and spilled the beans on his upcoming Strictly Come Dancing stint.

The Freddie Slater actor, who is the son of the late Jade Goody and Jeff Brazier, admitted he wouldn’t “like to compare the two” when quizzed how training for the BBC dance competition varies to soap life.

“EastEnders is great, Strictly is great - I don’t think me doing Strictly makes my time at EastEnders any better,” Bobby mused when chatting with the Mirror. The young actor also touched on his spiritual side.

“I meditate and I try to remember things that really ground me and great things people have told me. I read and I chant - hopefully I can keep that up,” the actor confessed.

Holly goes it alone

They may currently be presenting This Morning together but co-stars Alison and Holly both walked the red carpet alone earlier this evening - with the rest of the ITV show’s team arriving together.

Craig Doyle and Dermot O’Learly joined their colleagues as they made their way inside London’s O2 Arena as the This Morning team prepare to find out if they will retain their crown as the nation’s favourite daytime TV show.

It was reported over the weekend that This Morning bosses 'know it isn’t going to be a stellar year' for the ITV show at the NTAs tonight, amid backroom staff being left 'upset' over a lack of invite to the star-studded event.

""People are upset at the slimming down as the show is such a group effort and the awards are usually a big night out for the whole team. They’re blaming the cost-of-living crisis but seem to be splashing the cash elsewhere. It doesn’t help to shut down rumours of a toxic atmosphere,"" a TV source claimed on Sunday.

NTA host reveals how Ant and Dec help him present the show

Host Joel Dommett has confessed he focuses on Geordie duo Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly while presenting the NTAs because “they laugh at everything”.

“I genuinely look at Ant and Dec the whole time, and I’m not even exaggerating because Ant and Dec are such good audience members,” he admitted ahead of the ceremony kicking off in less than an hour’s time. “They are brilliant because they have done it for a long time and they know more than anyone how hard live television is, and so they laugh at everything. And so I just direct everything towards them, they’re usually right front and centre.”

He added: “They really are fantastic, I really look up to them in my career and down to them when I do the awards.”

Maura Higgins wows in pearl draped dress

Maura Higgins, who was an Islander on Season 5 of Love Island has donned a stunning pearl draped dress for this year's NTAs. The dress has caught the attention of many fashion lovers on the red carpet with it's flattering silhouette, while being perfectly teamed with minimal accessories.

Draping pearls seem to be a popular look this season, with the likes of ASOS stocking similar styles with this stunning ASOS DESIGN embellished mini dress with drape pearl sleeve for just £110.

The EastEnders Six

The EastEnders Six - aka Denise (Diane Parish), Kathy (Gillian Taylforth), Linda (Kellie Bright), Sharon (Letitia Dean), Stacey (Lacey Turner) and Suki ( Balvinder Sopal ) - arrived in style earlier this evening.

The soap stars donned gowns linked their respective characters’ “Christmas colours” amid the long-running BBC show’s groundbreaking fast forward festive special later this year. This bold, bright and beautiful colour scheme could be something we could expect to find in stores for party season- with the likes of popular brands Lavish Alice and Revolve stocking some similar statement dresses for fall already available online now.

There have been many theories about which man ends up dead this Christmas on the day that Sharon ties the knot. We know The Six women - Denise (Diane Parish), Kathy (Gillian Taylforth), Linda (Kellie Bright), Sharon (Letitia Dean), Stacey (Lacey Turner) and Suki ( Balvinder Sopal ) - find the body, but did they have a part in his death, and was it accidental or was it murder?

Committing to their day jobs, the six women all incorporated cufflinks into their gowns for this evening’s NTAs - certainly something that will send internet sleuths wild with new theories. Social media has been rife about who the man might be, with the cast even sharing their theories and ideas on who could die this festive season. Guesses have included the likes of Nish Panesar, Keanu Taylor and new arrival Theo, whilst Ravi's name has also been suggested and Jack Branning is the most likely candidate at present given that he's got the amber cufflinks that the victim has.

Line of Duty star's NTA performance

This Is England actress Vicky McClure has said that the Our Dementia Choir will be performing at the National Television Awards and said that “it’s going to be a moment for the dementia world”. The Line of Duty actress, 40, spoke to the PA news agency on the red carpet at the National Television Awards and mentioned the the choir had performed at her wedding to Jonathan Owen.

She said: “Not many things in life are perfect, but that moment (her wedding) was and it was so special. We all had a massive party. You know, it was just joyful.” Our Dementia Choir was founded by the actress and is a singing group made up of people with dementia.

Alison spends time with fans as Love Island stars chat with the Mirror

This Morning nominee Alison spent over 20 minutes chatting with fans and taking selfies before heading inside ready to find out if she will be taking home the best presenter prize.

Love Island stars Molly Marsh and Zachariah Noble caught up with the Mirror on the red carpet earlier this evening, opening up about how they deal with hate and the best aspects of being in a relationship since leaving the villa. “I don’t know what I don’t see and if I do, I’m scrolling straight past it,”Zach admitted to the Mirror. “Last thing you want to do is not feel free to do you. It’s not like you’re not human - everyone’s going to get it but hopefully most blocked now.”

The loved-up pair went on to discuss life away from the ITV2 series, saying “Being in the villa, one of the biggest milestones is living together. We’re looking forward to spending time with our families. It was busy coming off the show and it’s going to get busier. We’re starting a life together and this is out of the ordinary for both of us but we’re in this together and we just have to find our own time to be normal.

This ASOS lilac maxi dress is identical to Holly's red carpet look

Amy Dowden sends fans wild

Strictly Come Dancing professional Amy Dowden, who is currently undergoing treatment for cancer, has received a warm welcome as she arrives on the red carpet ahead of tonight’s ceremony.

Amy announced in May that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer and later revealed that she had undergone a mastectomy. As the dancer made her way inside the O2 Arena, fans screamed “We love you Amy” and “You’re inspiring”.

From Amy Dowden, Stacey Solomon and Eastenders star Lacey Turner, the ruffled layered look seems to be one of the more popular look's from tonight's star studded event.

We couldn't help but notice that the likes of Karen Millen, Coast and Amazon Fashion all stock some more affordable alternatives.

Holly reveals her look as Piers Morgan braves the tube

Holly has revealed her look for the evening and looks her usual glamorous self. Captioning the snap of herself posing in a strapless lilac gown, Holly told her Instagram followers: “ NTA’s … lets go! To everyone who has been nominated tonight, enjoy every moment… Thank you to @patsyoneillmakeup using BeautyPie @danniiwhiteman and @cilerpeksah_hairstylist for getting me glammed up… love you!!!! #hwstyle‍ dress by @suzanneneville jewellery @mappinandwebb bag by @emmylondonofficial @officialntas.”

Meanwhile, former Good Morning Britain anchor Piers Morgan is making his way to London’s O2 Arena via public transport, with the TalkTV presenter sharing a snap of himself on the tube on Twitter minutes ago. Wearing a standard black tie and suit and clutching a bottle of water, the divisive star quipped: “On my way to the ⁦ @OfficialNTAs - my first time on the tube for 30+ years. Hasn’t got any cooler has it…”

Sam Thompson's style statement

Former Made in Chelsea star Sam Thompson has made a bold statement on the red carpet this evening, with the two-time Celebs Go Dating contestant donning a pair of crocs for the black tie event at London’s O2 Arena.

Sam, whose girlfriend is Strictly Come Dancing 2023 contestant Zara McDermott, rocked a pair of baby blue Crocs with his traditional black suit as he posed for selfies with fans before making his way inside. Swapping your brogues for a pair of Crocs is certainly one way to make an entrance and get people talking I guess.

Glam Alison is ready to go

Speaking of This Morning, NTAs nominee Alison is ready and raring to go! The former Big Brother contestant has given fans a sneak peak of her chic look ahead of the red carpet opening at 6pm, with the new Great British Bake Off host looking stunning in a bejewelled black gown and matching sheer cape.

“I’m ready and off to the @officialntas so excited! Whatever happens if I forget ……thank you for getting @thismorning and me into the category’s [sic] with your votes . You are the best,” the Brummie babe captioned the post on Instagram.

Will Alison be accessorising her chic look with a silver NTA trophy later this evening? You’ll have to tune into ITV1 from 8pm this evening to find out (or rely solely on this blog if you want!)

What are This Morning nominated for?

Although the NTAs are about more than just one show, it’s safe to say that the focus will be on This Morning as the ITV show attempts to stay on its daytime TV throne following the Schofield scandal.

This Morning will go up against The Chase, Loose Women and The Repair Shop when it defends its title later this evening as the ITV team hopes to take home the best daytime honour once again. Schofield and Holly had been longlisted for the best TV presenter prize, alongside fellow This Morning hosts Alison Hammond, Dermot O’Leary, Rylan Clark and Martin Lewis, but only Alison and Martin made the cut.

Sabrina Cowley wanted to speak out after she was harassed on the school run by the scratch card winner. She thought he was being friendly but it soon turned nasty

A horrified mum has revealed she was sexually harassed on the school run by a dad who hit the headlines after winning £44k on a scratch card.

Sabrina Cowley thought Simon Rowland was just a friendly parent when he began chatting to her in the schoolyard.

But the 43-year-old mum soon became uncomfortable after he made lewd comments about her skirt and gave her his hotel room number.

Rowland, 50, who won big on a scratch card, was handed a restraining order in November 2022 and ordered to stay away from Sabrina.

Mum of three Sabrina, from Knutsford, Cheshire, has spoken out and waived her anonymity.

She said: ""I tried to ignore him for as long as I could, but it got very awkward in the playground. It was cringey at first but then I started to feel intimidated and anxious.

""I've had abuse from members of his family since he was in court, yet I am the victim in all of this.

""It's not Ok for certain men to treat women like objects and say whatever comes into their heads. Attitudes have to change, and I hope I can help by speaking out.""

Sabrina first got chatting to Rowland early in the summer of 2022 as they dropped their children at primary school, and he at first seemed friendly.

She says: ""He'd had an amputation below the knee and told me he'd been in an accident and that was why he was a stay-at-home dad.

""He was fine at first, just another parent, but then he started saying: ""˜Hello beautiful' and telling me how nice I looked.

""I run classes in pole fitness and I am used to men occasionally trying to overstep the mark, thinking they can push the boundaries, so I just gave him the cold shoulder.

""But one day, I was leaning into my car, clipping in my daughter's car seat, and he came up right behind me and said: ""Well, Christmas has come early.""

""It was really cringey. I was shaken up and I told him he was being inappropriate.""

But days later, Sabrina spotted Rowland sitting on a pub wall opposite her home.

Single mum Sabrina, who also runs a market stall, says: ""He told me he was having trouble with his wife and he was staying in a hotel nearby. He gave me his room number and said I should join him if I fancied some company.

""Obviously I declined.

""Days later, he tapped on my car window one day and told me: ""You looked so fit in that little black skirt the other day. I've never come out of school with an erection before.""

""I was appalled, and I decided enough was enough. I couldn't even take my daughter to school without sexual harassment.

""I spoke to the teaching staff and then I went to the police. I've been a victim of harassment in the past, and I put up with it for too long. I was determined not to make the same mistake again.""

In November 2022 Rowland, of Knutsford, Cheshire, admitted harassment without violence. He was sentenced to a community order and issued with a 12-month restraining order. He was also ordered to pay £395 costs.

Sabrina says: ""Since the court case, I've had horrible messages on social media, telling me it's my fault.

""In fact, I am the victim and it's important for women - and men - to feel confident to speak out about inappropriate behaviour.

""I found the courage to speak out against a school-run sleaze ball and I think other women will be safer for it.""

Footage shows Kym Beechey, from Australia, getting a terrifying surprise when she found a highly poisonous snake ""coiled"" in her daughter's shoe on the porch of her home

A mum has filmed the moment she found a highly poisonous snake ""coiled"" in her daughter's shoe in Australia.

Kym Beechey, from Jilliby, New South Wales, had gone outside to retrieve a lunchbox that had been left when she got a surprise.

There, with its head sticking out of one of her daughter's shoes, was a red-bellied black snake - a species infamous for its agonising bite.

She said: ""I headed to the front porch to collect an abandoned lunch box that was in danger of becoming the subject of a science experiment.

""I leaned down to pick up the lonely lunchbox and nearly headbutted my snakey friend, so although in a shoe it was my face that was in greatest danger.

""He was snuggled, coiled in the shoe.

""The shoe it was in is actually my daughter's mountain bike riding shoe and she was very pleased I found it and not her!""

Kym, 56, recognised the danger straight away.

She said: ""I was pretty certain it was a red belly black snake as we have had them here before.

""In fact, when I was in labor with my first child there was one in the house - and when I brought my child home from hospital, there was one in our bedroom.

""We know they can be about, so we do take care, however it is always a surprise to find them so close to you. In this case, so close to my face.""

The bite of the red-bellied black snake is characterised by severe pain - causing swelling, prolonged bleeding, and localised necrosis or skin death, sometimes leading to amputation.

The venom of the red-bellied black snake contains neurotoxins, myotoxins, and coagulants, and has haemolytic properties.

Its symptoms include nausea, vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, or excessive sweating.

But it has not caused any recorded deaths down under and Ms Beechey knew it was unlikely to attack.

She said: ""As you may have read, the species is capable of causing a dangerous venomous bite. I am aware of that but also know they are rarely aggressive.

""When I find them I like to just watch and wait for them to move on - and this one did move on.

""I was more concerned my silly dog would get bitten rather than me.""

As for why the shoes were outside in the first place, Kym said: ""Eight adults live in our house on a semi-rural property.

""Four are elite athletes and have many pairs of training shoes, work boots and outdoor shoes.

""As we have had rain recently, all stay outside.""

The Body Shop launch THREE beauty advent calendars

This year, The Body Shop is selling three advent calendars which are each filled with a selection of its cult-favourite goodies. Beauty fans can look forward to head-to-toe skincare, beauty and wellness treats, perfect for pampering over the holidays. Prices start at £59, so you needn't spend a fortune to get a beauty-filled advent for the Christmas countdown.

Inside the £59 Advent Calendar of Change are £119 worth of The Body Shop treats - 24 of them, in fact - including a vitamin E sheet mask, mango hand balm and so much more.

While we love the goodies inside, the delightful packaging of these calendars is also worth mentioning. The pop-up beauty advents all feature little drawers, perfect for storing your favourite bits and bobs after Christmas.

Meanwhile, the £95 Advent Calendar of Wonders has earned an average rating of 4.7 stars, with many beauty fans impressed with its contents and presentation.

The most expensive countdown of the bunch has a value of £250, but it can be yours for £145. The Body Shop's Advent Calendar of Wishes & Wonders includes the Edelweiss Liquid Peel, Moringa Shampoo and Conditioner, Shea Body Butter and more beautifying wonders.

Take a look at the full contents here.

What about Space NK?

There are few retailers who know their way around luxury beauty as well as Space NK,and now the premium retailer has revealed their sixth annual Christmas countdown, rivalling the likes of Cult Beauty and Harrods.

It’s definitely one of their best value calendars to date. Back in 2018, their calendar cost £250 but was worth over £600, then in 2020, the price dropped to £195, but so too did the value, coming in at over £480. Last year, it retailed at £215 with a value of £770 - but this season’s calendar is worth over £1,000, and will be priced at £235, saving shoppers over 75 per cent on the value of the products tucked inside.

Worth over £1,000, the calendar is priced at just £235,which is essentially £7.12 per item. Some retail over £50 alone, such as the Medik8 Crystal Retinal 6 (usually £66) so you can see just how easily the value racks up.

A 100% vegan beauty advent calendar? Go on then

Back by popular demand the Holland and Barrett advent calendar features 25-days of affordable beauty products - of which 16 are full sized - that will allow customers to pamper themselves over the festive-period.

The festive calendar has been beautifully designed, with every product being 100 per cent vegan, including some of the newest launches from brands including Faith in Nature, Q+A, Ethique, VitaSkin and WILD, in addition to a host of popular Holland and Barrett products.

Inside the Holland and Barrett Beauty Advent Calendar 2023:

This year’s Beauty Advent Calendar boasts its highest value to-date and is available for a budget pleasing £45 , but is worth a whopping £179, saving customers £134 (75%) on the RRP of all included items.

The most popular beauty product in advent calendars this year is worth £71

But one thing we noticed while reviewing the countless contents of each one was that there are a few brands that crop up time and time again. It’s no bad thing, that’s for sure, it simply means they’re popular with shoppers and are likely to entice you to purchase them.

What’s more though, is that on some occasions, the exact same product was cropping up, from TikTok viral purchases to skincare sensations. So, we decided to go through the most popular beauty advent calendars for 2023 and analyse what’s inside to see which brands and products are most commonly found.

It turns out that the most frequently recurring product this year is none other than The Rich Cream from Augustinus Bader. The brand cropped up seven times throughout - almost half of the calendars we looked at - and each and every time it was the exact same product: a 15ml sample of the coveted cream.

Here’s every calendar where it features this year:

Liberty

Cult Beauty

Harvey Nichols

Harrods

Space NK

Selfridges

Fenwick

You’ll notice that all of the above are what we consider to be the high end beauty advent calendars of 2023, and that’s because The Rich Cream bumps up the value of these calendars quite dramatically, with this deluxe sample size being worth an eye watering £71. It’s not the kind of money that people can justify spending on one item, least not before Christmas, but when included in a money-saving haul of products, it’s a great way to snag it for less.

A revolutionary face cream is said to be inspired by 30 years of research and innovation, that patented 'Trigger Factor Complex' (TFC8) which ‘unlocks a code’ in your skin that repairs tissue. Considered a ‘holy grail’ by many, this formula is best-suited to those with normal to dry skin types and can help visibly reduce the signs of ageing and environmental damage.

I unboxed the ASOS beauty calendar and these are my top five picks

Already we’ve taken a peek behind the doors of the PrettyLittleThing and Revolution both having ones for under £50, as well as mid-range festive offerings from LookFantastic and M&S, while others are a little more expensive like Liberty. But if you consider yourself a fan of Charlotte Tilbury, Elemis, Sol de Janeiro and the likes, then ASOS’s beauty advent calendar might be the one to find its way into your online basket this year.

The 25-day advent calendar is priced at £90, joining the likes of Glossybox and Boots Macmillan as those under the £100 mark. The products inside are worth a whopping £397, which is around four times the price you pay, with treats spanning the self-care sphere from cosmetics and skincare to candles and hair products.

ASOS have included a great mix of best loved brands, viral sensations and newbies to discover, packaged it in a fun and exciting way, striking the ultimate balance between price and products, making ASOS’s one of the most exciting beauty advent calendars money can buy this Christmas.

The Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk Dreams Luxury Palette is worth £45 alone - with this single product being worth half of the total price of the box. If that’s not enough to convince you, I don’t know what will. In fact, the value of my top five products alone exceed the price you pay for the box, rendering the other 20 items - which include the likes of Rituals, Elemis and MAC completely free.

Here are my top five picks:

Deal stack gets shoppers £100 worth of freebies when buying ESPA advent calendar

The ESPA wellness beauty calendar landed online this week (October 2) and so if you move fast, you could be one of the first to get your hands on it. Worth nearly £420, it costs £175, saving 58 per cent on the RRP.

However, when shoppers spend over £120 on the ESPA website, they also qualify for the Evening Serenity gift, worth £54, which stars a further four ESPA favourites. But it doesn’t end there because when you spend over £70 you also get to select two miniatures for free, and if you opt for the highest value ones, you can get another £45 worth of skincare for free.

We recommend choosing the Optimal Skin Pro-Serum 10ml, worth £20 and the Tri-Active Regenerating Calming CICA Cleansing Balm 50ml, worth £25, but ultimately, choose what you’re most likely to use as the other samples are still worth £10 each.

This means that in purchasing the £175 ESPA calendar , shoppers can get £99 worth of extra goodies, making the total value £518, saving 66 per cent.

My verdict on the PrettyLittleThing calendar

I'm a big fan of this calendar and consider it to be one of the best budget beauty options out there.

There are some seriously impressive brands tucked inside the PLT beauty advent calendar this year - I’m talking about the kind we’d expect to see in the likes of Cult Beauty, Space NK or LookFantastic. While the overall value is lower than these calendars at £198, it’s still almost four times the price you pay at under £50, offering shoppers the chance to get a taste of luxury without the huge price tag. I feel like £48 is a really accessible price point, and when you do the girl maths, it works out at £2 per item inside, which is incredible.

While I may have had some complaints about some duplications, there isn’t actually a single product in the PLT calendar that I wouldn’t use, and will certainly help generate excitement throughout December and ensure I have everything I need to be party ready come the 25th.

Whether you are treating yourself, or looking for the ultimate Christmas gift, the PrettyLittleThing beauty advent calendar is definitely one of the best value calendars for under £50 this year, offering more variety than some of the single-brand options available like Revolution, Soap and Glory or Ted Baker.

Bethan's top picks from the PrettyLittleThing beauty calendar:

Aroma Active Universal Repair Cream

Stila Stay All Day Smudge Stick Waterproof Eye Liner

Bondi Sands Pure Concentrated Self Tan Drops

Pixi Hello Kitty Limited Edition Glow Tonic

PrettyLittleThing pink beauty advent calendar that's under £50

Coming in at £48, PrettyLittleThing's calendar is one of the most affordable on the market, alongside Revolution, Soap & Glory and Ted Baker, with its products totalling £198.

If you're looking to stock up on products for yourself ('with love from me, to me'), your family, your friends as a pre-Yuletide treat PLT's advent calendar has a whole bunch of fun size and full size products to last you the 24 days leading up to Christmas that'll really amp up your beauty routine for a fraction of what they would cost just in time for party season. Cheers to that.

We're talking cleansers, clay masks, make-up must-haves, essential lip balms, the lot. One product, the Plump It! hyaluronic lip plumper, costs £22.99 alone which is almost half of what the calendar itself costs.

Now, you may notice that this calendar is £3 more than its price last year. But its content is worth a lot more compared to 2022 where the calendar cost £45 but was worth £141. Pretty sweet deal if you ask us. Find it here.

Here's everything you can expect to find inside:

Mario Badescu Hyaluronic Dew Cream

Premium Eyelash Curler

Land Of Lashes Girl Boss False Eyelash

Starskin Dream Kiss Lip Mask

Dual Make Up Pencil Sharpener

Aroma Active Universal Repair Cream 15ml

This Works Deep Sleep Pillow Spray 5ml

Peaches & Cream Highlighter PC17 Brush

Carmex Premium Vanilla Stick 4.25g

Charlotte Tilbury's £160 beauty advent calendar

Charlotte Tilbury’s viral beauty advent calendar has made a return for 2023, after selling out in 2021 and 2022. The theme of this year’s calendar is Charlotte’s Lucky Chest of Beauty Secrets, and boy would we feel lucky to find this under the tree on December 1, that’s for sure.

At £160, it doesn’t come cheap, though the products inside are worth £223. That said, last year the calendar was £150 and worth £244, so the savings don’t seem to be quite as lucrative in 2023. The contents work out at just over £13 per product, with two full-size treasures inside, including Charlotte's Magic Lip Oil Crystal Elixir, which is usually £28, and the Hot Lips 2 lipstick in Glowing Jen, usually £29.

Here’s what is inside Charlotte’s Lucky Chest of Beauty Secrets 2023

What Martin Lewis' Money Saving Expert has to say about No7 Beauty Calendars

Martin Lewis' Money Saving Expert site has done a deepdive on the new No7 beauty advent calendars that launched this morning, and have totted up what they believe to be the total value. Some of them are said to be worth more than the Boots website states, however, some of them have been valued at slightly less.

Here's the comparison

No7 Lift and Luminate calendar

No7 Protect and Perfect calendar

No7 Restore and Renew calendar

No7 Ultimate Beauty calendar

The team added: ""Beauty Advent calendars are a way of bagging your wish list products at a fraction of the normal cost. While they’re intended to be opened daily throughout December, they're also great for dividing up as gifts in festive hampers or as birthday presents throughout the year.""

We got our hands on the M&S beauty advent calendar early

Now how would you like to see, and know if then M&S beauty advent calendar is really worth it? Well, we have an 'in' with Santa's elves and our Beauty Editor Sarah has had a peek inside the glorious contents, and even picked out five of her very own favourites that she thinks is worth it alone - not to mention that all 25 boxes are housed in the most beautiful, vegan leather vanity case, that you can use over and over again.

She said: “You’ll literally find everything you need, to keep you looking your best - from head to toe! We’re talking hair masks, shampoo and conditioner, mascara, lipstick, hand creams, facial moisturisers and face masks galore!

“When I tell you how excited and thrilled I was to see a beauty brand think outside the box this year with a sustainable beauty advent calendar concept… Naturally M&S were always going to be the ones to nail it, right? I mean not only is the vegan leather case practical, it’s so big too! I mean I’m either going to keep it for myself or give it to someone in my family this year - filled with some beauty treats.

""“I personally love a beauty advent calendar for having handy travel sized products for when I’m on the go, staying back at my parents house over the holidays or weekends away - but they are also really good for giving something a go I’ve never wanted to purchase full price. I also really love giving the miniatures away as stocking fillers to my cousin’s too - so they can also try something new out!

“For just £40, after spending £35 in store and online, I can put my hand on my heart and say that the beauty advent calendar is really worth it. Aside from the vanity case, it has some big name brands included like PIXI, Benefit, Murad, This Works, NUXE and REN to name a few - plus the L’Occitane, Shay & Blue and Philip Kingsley.""

Sarah's favourite products in the calendar this year are:

Benefit Roller Lash Mascara

NUXE Huile Prodigieuse

Murad’s Essential-C Day Moisture Broad Spectrum SPF30

M&S Apothecary Meditate Hand Cream

Honor's latest mid-range phone could seriously challenge both Samsung and Google's dominance of the android market

Honor 90 Review

Since Honor emerged from the shadow of Huawei, they have firmly established themselves as a brand to watch by establishing a solid reputation as an underrated contender against industry giants like Samsung and Google.

Honor smartphones have consistently impressed by offering a compelling combination of high-quality mid-range and budget devices that punch well above their weight.

Their devices have gained recognition for incorporating premium-looking styles and features for more affordable prices and the Honor 90 is yet another prime example of this. With some substantial upgrades, the 90 is their latest mid-ranger after the Honor 70.

With its elegant styling, the Honor 90 will certainly turn some heads thanks to its premium-looking thin, lightweight and shiny appearance measuring 161.9mm tall, 74.1mm wide, and very thin at only 7.8mm thick making it very comfortable to hold.

The 90 is sleek and slim, with curved edges giving it a premium feel. It certainly stands out against devices like the Nothing Phone, Samsung S23 and iPhones.

Weighing in at a mere 183g, it is impressively lightweight for a modern phone so it won't make your arm ache on long gaming sessions and you won't drop it on your face when you're doom scrolling at 1 am.

Processor: Snapdragon Gen 7.1 Screen: 6.7"" 120Hz AMOLEDRAM: 8GB / 12GB Storage: 256GB / 512GB

It comes in three colours Midnight Black, Emerald Green with Dimonmd Silver reserved as an Honor online store exclusive. I'm glad to see they have ditched the smooth glossy finish used previously for a slightly more textured brushed metal coloured back, which is easier to hold and doesn't pick up fingerprints so it'll look great for longer.

The phone features a curved metal frame and a surprisingly solid plastic back, which explains its weight but unlike phones with glass or metal backs, you'll need to avoid dropping. Thankfully, it comes with a plastic case, but it lacks water protection with no IP protection rating.


The dual camera modules are attractive and not obtrusive due to their attractive oval appearance but I wish they were integrated like on the Honor Magic 4.

Honor has once again raised the bar with the 90's stunning 6.7-inch, AMOLED, curved screen that looks honestly looks amazing and provides a blissful visual experience.

This is in part due to its impressive screen-to-body ratio of 93.3% and minimal bezels to distract you, it creates a truly immersive experience normally reserved for flagships costing three times the price.

It also ensures smooth on-screen action, with a dynamic refresh rate of 60 to 120 Hz, which can adjust depending on what you are watching and with a sharp resolution of 2664 x 1200 it is fantastic for gaming.

The display is brighter than ever and supports HDR 10+ for enhanced contrast and showcases vivid colours that truly stand out no matter what you are watching.

Yet again you'll need to be careful as that screen doesn't come with any reenforcement or glass protection.

While the panel is very bright outdoors, it can be a little hard to hear what you're watching due to its single speaker on the bottom which I found a little quiet and it's very easy to cover by accident.

On the CPU front, the 90 uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 Accelerated Edition. This chip is a decent upgrade from the Honor 70, but it isn't as powerful as the 8 Series used in the Samsung S23 or Nothing Phone 2.

This 4nm processor can handle most mobile gaming in all but the highest settings and can easily deal with most day-to-day tasks, being very responsive and smooth.

On Geekbeck 6 designed to test the performance of this phone, it received a rating of 1092 Single core and 3131 multi-core performance which places it just behind the Google Pixel 7, more powerful than the Samsung A54 and slightly ahead of the Honor 70.

There are two RAM configurations either 8 GB or 12 GB, with more RAM allowing you to have more apps open simultaneously, apps load faster and make your web browser quicker and more responsive.

This can be further expanded with Honors RAM Turbo technology which can add up to 7GB of extra RAM to the phone, allowing even more multitasking.

There are two storage options with the 90 starting at 256GB and going up to 512Gb you'll have tons of space for games, apps, pictures, video and films but there is no expandable micro-SD storage.

Battery life is fantastic, with its 5000 mAh cell lasting all day with some extra juice to spare, providing roughly 14 hours with moderate to heavy use. It also features a 66W Supercharging that can get it back up to 45% in just 15 minutes and took just over 40 mins to fully charge. A charging plug is also supplied but does not include wireless charging.


The camera here is a stand-out feature, this offers a 200MP main shooter and a 12MP Ultra Wide and Macro camera supported by a 2MP Depth camera.

With the main camera's huge 200 MP sensor, it captures an incredible amount of detail and also helps it stand out among other mid-tier phones.

With images shot in full 200MP mode, you can zoom into and crop images severely without losing much quality or print to massively poster sizes which is handy as this phone does not feature a zoom lens and the cropping will help if you can't get close to your subject like at gigs and events.

While the colours pop, it's a little too much leaving pictures oversaturated and slightly darker than real life which reminded me of the old days of Samsung.

For those who love selfies, there is also a 50M front-facing camera which allows you to take better quality self-portraits than ever before and also makes your appearance on video calls clearer too.

It's also pretty wide for a front camera which makes group shots with friends and pictures of yourself in front of a landscape and large buildings much easier.

Low light performance was just ok with night shots showing degraded quality and quite grainy.

Mult-Video mode also returns allowing you to shoot with both your subject and yourself in the frame at the same time, which is great for reaction videos and just fun to mess around with.

Based on Android 13, the Honor 90's uses MagicOS 7.1 which is attractive and simple to use with some nice customisation options via themes.

However, it also comes bundled with some apps I'd never heard of in addition to some more well-known ones like TikTok, Netflix, Facebook and booking.com. Thankfully these can all be removed but I'm not a fan of preloaded apps as I'd rather choose for myself.

It's worth noting that Honor 90 comes with 2 years of OS updates and 3 years of security updates making it less of a long-term investment and falling behind Google's, OnePlus and Samsungs support.

Pricing is pretty competitive, with the 8GB RAM and 256 storage configuration starting at £449, however for only £50 more you can double this to 12GB RAM and 512GB storage, making this one of those rare times it's worth going for the higher spec option.

It's facing some stiff competition too in this price range including the Google Pixel 7a, Nothing Phone 1 and the Samsung Galaxy A54 but the Honor 90 easily pulls ahead on raw power.

Honor 90 Verdict: 4/5

The Honor 90 is definitely a stand-out model among mid-range devices, especially in this price range, its stunning display, and great camera as well as its generous storage capacity and long battery life.

It's a smartphone with ideas well above its station challenging other mid-range devices and even some flagships with its simply gorgeous look and great performance.

The Honor 90 is available now from the Honor website starting at £449 for the 8GB / 256GB model and £500 for the 12GB / 512GB Model.","https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/tech/article30413065.ece/ALTERNATES/n615/1_HONOR-90.jpg","(Image: Honor)",6,TRUE,FALSE

Dual national Woramet Ben Taota borrowed his mother's blue scooter on Saturday afternoon, before he was found dead on Sunday morning. He is believed to have been murdered

Haunting CCTV has emerged of the last sighting of a British teenager found murdered in Thailand.

Dual national Woramet Ben Taota borrowed his mother's blue scooter and was seen in the CCTV clip riding with a girl on the back of the bike at about 7.15pm on Saturday.

The 16 year old was found dead the next day in the Lampang province in the north of the country.

Police say Ben was 'romantically involved' with his passenger, 16-year-old Suraphltchaya Khamsa, and the pair had visited her grandfather at around 4.25pm on Saturday.

Another girl, who was riding pillion on the scooter, was dropped off by them at around 7.15pm and this was the last sighting of Ben with Suraphltchaya as they rode off into the darkness.

There are fears for Suraphltchaya who has not yet been tracked down.

Police Major General Mongkol Sampawapol, commander of Lampang Provincial Police, said officers are still searching for Suraphltchaya as she was 'the last person to see Ben' before he was killed.

He said: ""Suraphltchaya's nickname was Ping Pong.

""She also had a close romantic relationship with the deceased. She is still missing and we are actively searching for her.

""She was the last person to see Ben.""

Police said a 44-year-old man, named as Chaiwat Boongarin, had been arrested.

""A suspect has been apprehended who had known the victim for a long time,"" Major General Sampawapol said.

""He denies having any involvement in the death.

""However, we believe he is involved and it is connected to drug dealing in the area.""

Police said the suspect had been released from prison around eight months ago following previous convictions for sex crimes.

They claimed that Chaiwat was seen riding his black Honda Wave motorcycle without a license plate on Saturday, May 6 at around 9pm and parked it at his relative's house with a young woman they believe is Ben's girlfriend, Suraphltchaya.

Police Major General Mongkol Sampawapol added: ""The suspect told his relative that he wanted to leave his motorcycle at their house.

""He told them that he was looking for a rental house for his mistress. He then left the house with another motorcycle and returned the next morning.

""After that, he rode the black Honda Wave and left it near the hut before officers found it on May 9.

""We are still searching for the young woman and believe that she is still safe.""

Police officers from the Mae Tha district said they received a report on Sunday morning that Ben, who was a British-Thai dual national, had been found dead in a grove in the Ban Than district.

Officers found in his black shoulder bag, a smartphone charger and a red wallet containing his ID card and bank card.

His smartphone and cash were missing, with police suggesting he could have been robbed for the gadgets and money.

Police believe Ben was killed elsewhere and dumped in the woods, as there were no signs of struggle where his remains were found.

They said he had head injuries consistent with severe trauma.

Police Colonel Sittisak Singtongla, superintendent of the Mae Tha Police, said: ""The station received a notification at 10.15am that a deceased person was found in the undergrowth.

""The investigating team went to the area and found the victim.

""The face and head were found to have been beaten with a hard object until swelling and bruising was caused. There was also a deep wound in his face.

""The body has been taken to hospital for an autopsy.""

Officers interviewed Ben's mother, Ooy Taota, who is understood to be separated from Ben's British father, who now lives back in the United Kingdom.

Ooy told police that her son had said goodbye to her on Saturday evening and said he was 'going to work with friends' but he did not give any more details to her.

She was pictured today as she visited the spot where Ben was found dead.

Aries (Mar 21 - Apr 20)

Let other people offer advice if that's what they want to do. Some will not realise you do actually know what you are doing. Continue with what you feel instinctively is the right way. A new source of income will be discovered. It's getting easier to make money.

Taurus (Apr 21 - May 21)

The key question about going ahead with something completely new is: how ready for this are you? If there might be some big challenges ahead, how resilient are you? Some important decisions come under the spotlight but you can expect to receive useful help and advice.

Gemini (May 22 - June 21)

Worries and uncertainties that have been on your mind will be but a memory today. You may even wonder why you ever doubted your decisions, plans or actions in the first place when everything has turned out better than you could even have anticipated.

Cancer (June 22 - July 23)

It won't be difficult to put your ideas to work. It shouldn't take long before others start to realise that improvements can be made by following your suggestions. Not only this but they will be happy to make an extra effort to achieve a mutual aim.

Leo (July 24 - Aug 23)

A small windfall or bonus may have you itching to hit your favourite online stores but before you do, consider the demands the future might bring. You've known what it is like to struggle financially and this could be the chance you have been dreaming of to build your savings.

Virgo (Aug 24 - Sept 23)

Begin to make secret dreams a reality. If you sense someone in your world has written you off as being stuck in your ways, they may have to think again. A bold mood is starting to take hold of you and you're ready to break through barriers that have been holding you back.

Libra (Sept 24 - Oct 23)

If there's anything in your life that could benefit from some behind the scenes research then get started today. You will do well in any area involving investigation, research or restoration. In fact any kind of work that requires detailed focus will be good for you.

Scorpio (Oct 24 - Nov 22)

With you having been so helpful towards others recently, they are looking for ways to show their appreciation. An invitation to a splendid social event could be just one of the pleasant surprises this day will bring your way.

Sagittarius (Nov 23 - Dec 21)

Offers and opportunities that will bring new life experiences are starting to pour in now. Look upon the world as being your oyster. This is your chance to broaden your experience of life through travel and study or by tackling challenges head on.

Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 20)

Everyone is trying their hardest. You want to do everything properly. You are doing this for good reasons but you're being over-critical of yourself and others. This is making you irritable while putting them on the defensive. Instead of complaining, offer compliments and notice the difference.

Aquarius (Jan 21 - Feb 19)

Delays and transport problems will cause frustrations. If you are on the move, be willing to take a detour. There are worse things that can happen than being late for a meeting or appointment. Contact anyone who is expecting you and once you explain the situation, they will understand.

Pisces (Feb 20 - Mar 20)

Losing yourself in daydreams and fantasy can make you happy but it will be necessary to take a logical and realistic approach to matters that are cropping up today. Close relationships of every description, whether they are platonic, romantic or of the business variety may undergo a shakeup.

The tragic death of toddler Dexter Yael occurred at his family home in the morning of May 1 in San Isidro de El General of the Central American country

A two-year-old boy has been mauled to death by the family's pet dog in Costa Rica.

The tragic incident happened in the morning of May 1 in San Isidro de El General of the Central American country at his family home.

It has been reported that the German Shepherd, named Tayler and was four years old, suddenly latched onto the Dexter Yael's neck after he had fallen on top of the animal, according to the child's relatives.

Dexter's father Alex Guerra told local media: ""I wasn't at home at the time. But from what I understand, my son kind of stumbled on top of the dog and that's when it attacked him.""

He added that Dexter was his only child, although he does raise his wife's two children from a previous relationship as his own.

Alex said: ""The dog was used to my son. They'd been together since he was a newborn.""

Dexter died from his injuries at Hospital Dr Fernando Escalante Pradilla. His mother, Yojebeth Guevara suffered several bites while trying to protect her toddler son.

An uncle and two neighbours were also bitten while trying to pull the dog away from Dexter.

A neighbour called Oscar RodrÃ­guez was eventually able to drag the German Shepherd off the toddler.

Ruben RodrÃ­guez, president of the Canine Federation of Costa Rica, visited the home and said the dog was well looked after with plenty of space to move around the property.

The animal has been seized by the National Animal Health Service, which will decide on its fate in the coming days.

Another tragic incident occurred on the coastal Palestinian region in the Gaza Strip, also on May 1, when a lion mauled a boy to death.

In the images, the lion can be seen mauling the boy, who is seemingly stuck in between the bars of the cage. Footage shows the place where the boy went through the protective fence with bloodstains can be seen on the cage's bars.

Police spokesman Col. Ayman Al-Batniji said the boy had climbed through the protective fence in the Asdaa Park zoo in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis, when he was attacked by the lion.

The chickens have a staggeringly short life - a journey that sees them go from egg to slaughter in just 35 days - to help feed the UK's billion chickens-a-year habit

A landmark battle to improve the lives of Britain's cheap supermarket chickens will start tomorrow in the high court.

About 90 per cent of the birds raised annually for meat in the UK are from fast-growing breeds dubbed ""franken-chickens"" which can gain up to 100g a day.

They also have a staggeringly short life - a journey that sees them go from egg to slaughter in just 35 days - to help feed the UK's billion chickens-a-year habit.

Once killed, cleaned and wrapped in plastic, a whole chicken can be bought for as little as £2.88 - less than the cost of a cup of coffee. But at what cost to the bird?

This question forms the basis of an unprecedented High Court case, which starts on Wednesday, with an outcome that could fundamentally change the way chickens are reared.

The Humane League has been granted a court hearing to challenge the Government over the legality in England over what it calls franken-chickens.

Under a law dating back to 2007, animals may be kept for farming purposes only 'if it can reasonably be expected""¦ that they can be kept without any detrimental effect on their health or welfare'.

The animal welfare organisation will argue that broiler chickens, which have been bred to grow 400 per cent faster than those farmed in 1950, breaches welfare regulations.

As a result, they can suffer from a wide range of health and welfare issues, including heart attacks, lameness, bone deformities, muscle diseases, burns and organ failure.

""ŒA third also struggle to walk and many suffer horrific injuries and illness. Space is so tight that in their last weeks the birds have no more floor space on average than an A4 sheet of paper each.

""ŒSean Gifford, Managing Director of The Humane League UK, said: ""The future of billions of animals hangs in the balance. I hope that fast-growing Frankenchickens, who are born and die in grim factories across the country, get the help they desperately deserve.""Œ

""Fast growing chickens are trapped in their own bodies and are victimised by constant pain and illness. We want a future where animals are treated with compassion and respect. That is a future where Frankenchickens no longer exist.""

Edie Bowles, Solicitor and Managing Director of Advocates for Animals which is representing The Humane League, said: ""We are heading to court with stacks of evidence that prove fast-growing chickens are suffering because of their genetics, something which the law does not allow.

""There is no question in our minds that the Government permits the use of these breeds, which dominate the poultry sector. We now have a chance to do right by the law and the billions of chickens who are suffering as a result of its current application.""

Last year, the Mirror revealed how chickens reared for Morrisons spend the last days of their miserable, short lives in ""extreme"" pain packed in overcrowded farms.

""ŒOpen Cages filmed many birds with deformed legs and told how they saw some that ""frantically flapped their wings before collapsing in pain"".

""ŒIn one clip, a bird can be seen with an open wound on its chest and older wounds crusted with blood covering its back.

""ŒWith the vast majority of the chicken available on supermarket shelves coming from fast-growing breeds, The Humane League and Open cages, alongside the RSPCA, is urging retailers and the food service industry to sign-up to the Better Chicken Commitment.

""ŒIt aims to improve the welfare of broiler chickens by providing them with more space, natural lighting, and importantly only allows slower-growing breeds of chickens.

Retailers and foodservice companies such as Marks & Spencer and KFC have already signed-up to the Commitment - but there's many retailers in the UK who are yet to make the pledge.""Œ

Emily Harris, campaign manager at the RSPCA, said: ""We want all UK retailers and the food service industry to sign up to the Better Chicken Commitment and commit to the minimum broiler ask by 2026.

""This will have a huge impact on the welfare of chickens as it tackles the main issues which affect them such as growth rates, space, enrichment and lighting.""

Tourists flock to ""Scottish Pompeii"" to see prehistoric houses still furnished with stone ""dressers"" and box-beds as well as artefacts such as tools, gaming dice, and jewellery

A subterranean hole in the ground frequented by superstitious tourists has been identified as really an ""old sewer"".

Occupied from around 3100 to 2500 BC, Skara Brae on the Orkney Islands is one of the earliest known and best preserved farming settlements in the British Isles. Dubbed the ""Scottish Pompeii"" and second only in popularity to the Ring of Brodgar, tourists flock to the settlement to see prehistoric houses still furnished with stone ""dressers"" and box-beds as well as artefacts such as tools, gaming dice, and jewellery.

But those harbouring hopes of winning the lottery will be disappointed by the revelation that a popular ""wishing well"" at the site is in fact part of a rather more practical sewer system of well-built drains and large cisterns.

Kinlay Francis, a tour guide from the local operator Orkney Uncovered, wrote on Facebook:

""For years people have been throwing money down a subterranean hole in the Skara Brae ground, thinking they are throwing money down a well to make a wish. I have great delight in telling my clients and anybody who throws their money down there that they are in fact throwing money down a toilet.

""This is the old drain/sewer from the Skara Brae site. It is not and I repeat NOT a wishing well. So don't go there to spend a penny.""

The post quickly gathered more than 2,000 reactions and almost 150 comments. One said: ""Oh! So! Priceless!""

""It's not a wishing well""¦it's a s******g well,"" a second offered. A third echoed: ""Really a p*****g well not a wishing well then"". Others were less willing to give up on their faith.

""Still""¦maybe brings good luck"", argued a fourth. A fifth wrote: ""Where there is muck there is brass!""

Self-taught geologist William Watt of Skaill began an amateur excavation of Skara Brae after the site was first uncovered by a storm in 1850. Alongside a large chambered tomb (Maes Howe) and two ceremonial stone circles (the Stones of Stenness and the Ring of Brodgar), the settlement is now one of many monuments that make up the ""Heart of Neolithic Orkney"", a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1999.

Thai farm owner Suparat Jitlang said she was shocked to find the newborn with just a single eye and no nose and that in all her years raising goats she had never encountered a cyclopse

A rare one-eyed baby goat has baffled farmers after it was born in Thailand on Monday.

The cyclops kid was delivered at the Farmsook Homestay, an agritourism destination in Uthai Thani province, yesterday morning.

Farm owner Suparat Jitlang said she heard the mother goat, Nang Kroh, giving birth to the mutant offspring at around 8 am.

She went to the stables to check but was shocked to find the newborn with just a single eye and no nose.

Suparat said: ""I was so surprised. I've been raising goats for a long time, but it's the first time I've encountered one like this.""

She added that the kid appeared healthy, apart from its facial deformities.

Footage shows the baby cyclops bleating while being groomed by its mum.

The goat does not have any nostrils, so it was seen panting constantly to gulp in air.

The baby goat is believed to be suffering from cyclopia, a rare genetic defect in which the offspring's brain fails to divide properly into two hemispheres during development.

Suparat feared it would die soon from exhaustion due to breathing difficulties and cyclopia is linked to low survival rates but a day later the kid is still alive.

Suparat said: ""Its condition is unfortunate, but I can't do anything but accept it. We will have to see if it survives.""

This results in various physical abnormalities, including missing mouths and noses, in which case the newborn dies from suffocation shortly after birth.

In 2017, a goat was born in India with the same condition and had one large eye in the middle of its forehead.

The young goat had only one complete ear, a deformed nose, eyelids and eyelashes, and its jaws were unusually small and missing teeth, causing the tongue ""” which is normal size ""” to stick out on one side, YouTube channel Barcroft Animals reported in a video about the Cyclops.

It is unknown whether or not the goat survived.

The term ""Cyclops"" originated with the Greek ""KuklÅps,"" which means ""round-eyed"" and referred to mythological one-eyed giants.

Fossil discoveries of dwarf elephant skulls may have fueled myths of the monstrous Cyclops, the American Museum of Natural History explained, as the large nasal opening in the centre of its skull could have been interpreted as the cavity for one enormous eye.

If you've been intrigued by the bright green colours of matcha lattes but too afraid to make the leap, Blank Street's matcha expert has answers to all your questions

Coffee lovers will have noticed the steady expansion of matcha based beverages appearing in their favourite stores.

The bright green drink can feel a bit intimidating, especially if you're much more familiar with coffee but many hot drink fans are enjoying the eye catching beverage - which even has some health benefits.

Matcha is actually made from finely ground green tea leaves, which gives it its distinct colour, and has been used in Japanese tea culture for centuries.

Hash Parvez, matcha expert and field coffee trainer for Blank Street, has answered all the pressing questions about the tea, including whether it can satisfy your caffeine addiction.

Discover, learn, grow. We are Curiously. Follow us on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

The expert said: ""Matcha has a unique, earthy flavour and is known for its vibrant green colour. Our matcha originates from the region of Uji, Japan, on the southeast border of Kyoto.

""The farmers here have mastered the techniques of farming and harvesting matcha for over 500 years, making it the cream of the crop - we source all of our matcha at Blank Street from Uji, through PerfectTed, a matcha specialist recently featured on BBC's Dragons' Den.""

The green colour is totally natural and achieved by farming tea leaves that are the right shade. Cutting off sunlight and keeping the leaves shady for the last few weeks before harvest boosts the nutrient levels.

""This makes the plants overproduce chlorophyll to make up for the lack of light - giving it a distinct bright green colour,"" explained Hash.

""The bright green colour of the matcha can also be an indication of quality for this very reason, as shade growing is the preferred technique among matcha lovers. Matcha is a complex, earthy flavour, and if you've not tried higher quality matchas it sometimes can be slightly bitter. This is why we would always recommend going for a ceremonial grade!""

Don't worry though, you won't be missing out on your morning caffeine by switching to matcha drinks as it still contains the energy booster - but it releases it in a different way.

Hash explained: ""They both have different functions, as coffee provides a quicker energy boost perfect for the morning pick me up, whereas matcha releases smaller amounts more slowly which can see you through the afternoon. This means that they can work well in tandem, as well as on their own!""

Matcha isn't only good for your afternoon caffeine boost, it also contains antioxidants that help your cells repair and amino acid L-theanine which Hash says ""controls the body's uptake of caffiene in the bloodstream.""

Even better, the tea is known to have calming properties so won't give you the jittery feeling coffee sometimes does.

Hash said: ""The preparation processes differ significantly from one another. To make a matcha tea, we whisk single origin matcha with water to form a concentrate, and then whisk this further into hot water.

""For a matcha latte, we also whisk matcha into a concentrate, to which we then add steamed milk.

""By contrast, the method for a traditional coffee latte differs, given that coffee comes from beans as opposed to leaves. Coffee beans are ground in-house, then tamped, following from which water is forced through the grounds to extract the espresso, which is then poured over with steamed milk.

""Traditionally, matcha can be found as a powder for use in drinks such as lattes, or simply as a tea. At Blank Street, we have also innovated further to create drinks which serve as a great entry point to matcha.""

For anyone wanting to give matcha a go but prefers a sweeter coffee, Hash recommends trying a sweeter mix, such as a latte with fruit flavourings like the Blueberry Matcha Latte.

He said: ""This is a great option for those with a sweet tooth who want to dip their toe into the wonderful world of matcha.""

A new plant-based salmon alternative has been invented that is said to taste, look and even cook like the real fish - it arrives raw and crisps up in the same way

The hardest part about going plant based is finding alternatives for foods you really love. While Quorn nuggets might replace chicken ones, other alternatives are harder to find.

Plant-based diets are becoming increasingly popular as the market works to improve veggie offerings, with more and more brands moving away from bean burgers in favour of meat imitations.

Fish has been a tough one to mimic, with most companies perfecting their meat alternatives first or opting for fish fingers alternatives.

There are a few fake salmon fillets on the market already but a new plant-based salmon alternative that apparently looks, cooks, and tastes like the real thing could be on the way.

Discover, learn, grow. We are Curiously. Follow us on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

This salmon alternative was created in Toronto, Canada, and looks near-identical to real fish. Interestingly, it's all down to the science behind it.

New School Foods website reads: ""We've recreated the structure of a salmon filet, including aligned muscle fibers, connective tissue, fats, and other components thanks to our proprietary muscle fiber & scaffolding technologies.""

Looks aren't everything as the salmon alternative is also"" high in protein, and matches the same level of Omega 3's found in wild salmon"".

Rather than being prepared for consumers and pre-cooked, the fillet is raw and visibly cooks and crisps up like real fish.

Overfishing has become a major environmental issue, with populations of both flora and fauna declining at a concerning rate, as well as nets and other apparatus damaging the sea floor.

In 2021, The Guardian reported that salmon farming was ""wreaking ruin on marine ecosystems"" due to major sea lice infestations.

Natasha Hurley, campaigns manager at the Changing Markets Foundation, told the publication: ""Moving away from using wild caught fish in food would make salmon farming more sustainable, as it is having a huge impact on wild fish.""

Lab created salmon could ease the strain on marine life by opening doors to wider variety of fish replacements, minimising the need for industrial fishing practices and overfishing.

The salmon alternative is not yet on the market and will be launched in North America later this year but only in participating restaurants, so it could be some time before we see it on UK shelves.

Until then, there are some smoked salmon slices on the market as well as a salmon fillet from vegan brands Vivera and Sainsbury's Plant Pioneers, which are also fortified with omega-3.

Omega-3 fats are great for heart and brain health as well as reducing inflammation and helping regulate blood clotting.

Forgotten Souls are necessary to upgrade Sacred and Ancestral gear to their full potential, but it's hard to find them

Forgotten Souls are one of the best materials you can find in Diablo 4, allowing you to upgrade your items to their maximum potential.

Gear is abundant in Diablo 4, and you'll spend the majority of your time swapping between weapons as you find newer and better loot. But you're eventually going to find that perfect piece of armour or the weapon that speaks to you, and you'll want to push that to its full potential. Luckily, Diablo 4 lets you upgrade your loot at the cost of some hard-to-find materials.

One of the most valuable and, by extension, hard-to-find materials in Diablo 4 are Forgotten Souls which allow you to upgrade Ancestral and Sacred gear to the maximum upgrade level. While these items can be hard to find themselves, the materials required to buff them up are even tougher to get your hands on.

You can also use Forgotten Souls in enchantments which will randomly swap out stats and bonuses on your gear to craft that perfect build. Although due to the random nature of this, you'll want to have a lot of Forgotten Souls ready in case you don't get what you want.

How to get Forgotten Souls in Diablo 4

The best place to get Forgotten Souls in Diablo 4 is within Helltide zones. First thing's first, you'll need to be on World Tier Three or higher to access the Helltide zones.

The Helltide zones are world events in which Lilith's army takes over a huge portion of the map. These last for 60 minutes at a time, with 75 minutes in between spawns. You can tell if a Helltide zone is active by looking at your map and looking for a portion of the map surrounded by a red outline.

Before you enter one of these zones, make sure you're kit is up to snuff as these are some of the hardest areas in the game. Be ready to battle waves and waves of Lilith's best as you make your way through this cursed area.

Once you're in the Helltide zone you'll want to look for Screaming Hell Veins, which are ore deposits that you can mine away at; these have a chance of dropping Forgotten Souls. The keyword being 'chance' - as we mentioned before, these materials have a low drop rate, so don't be disheartened if you don't find some right away.

The other method is to find Helltide chests (known in-game as Tortured Gifts of Mystery). These will run you 175 Aberrant Cinders to open up, and again nothing is guaranteed. Go in with a mind that's prepared to scour the Helltide zone for the entire hour and find nothing, because it's a possibility. That way every one you do get is a nice surprise!

Love Island fan favourites Will Young and Jessie Wynter look more loved up than ever as they posed for a series of snaps on a romantic holiday to Paris

Will Young and Jessie Wynter have sparked engagement rumours after sharing snaps of their romantic holiday in Paris.

The Love Island stars, who met on this year's winter series, looked besotted with each other as they posed in front of the Sleeping Beauty castle at Disneyland Paris.

Farmer Will scooped Aussie Jessie up in his arms before sharing a romantic kiss as they both wore matching Disney jumpers.

Posting the snaps to Instagram, Will - who Jessie surprised with the trip for his 24th birthday - wrote: ""No words can describe how much I love and adore this girl!

""I still can't believe that we are in Paris + going to Disneyland. This was honestly the most magical and best day ever, and so fortunate I get to spend it with Jessie.""

He continued: ""Travelling and spending all this time together just gets me so excited for the future and crazy to think we have only known each other for 4 months!

""I can't wait for our next adventure, possibly going back to Jessie's home and creating even more memories.""

Jessie replied: ""Love you so damn much!! Exciting things to come"" followed by a red love heart emoji.

Before making it to Disneyland, the loved-up couple were also snapped snogging in front of the famous Eiffel Tower.

Revealing the trip was all her idea, Jessie captioned the post: ""In the villa, I asked Will where he would like to travel and he said Paris. SO for his birthday his family and I surprised him with a trip to Paris.

""Paris was also on my bucket list but I didn't think I'd be going anytime soon or ticking it off with someone I'm so in love with.

""Who would have thought that a girl all the way from little Tasmania and a farmer from the country in the UK would be madly in love visiting Paris together. Love you, Will.""

And Will appeared to hint he could see a wedding in the future with Jessie.

One fan wrote: ""Love yewwww guysssssss. First Love Island wedding 2023 hopefully in the foreseeable future,"" to which Will replied: ""Agreed.""

Delighted fans were quick to show their support for the couple with one writing: ""You two were meant to meet and find each other. The place you met doesn't matter, it's the timing that's important.""

Another commented: ""You are literally soulmates.""

A third said: ""I'm actually sobbing. This is so adorable,"" while a fourth chimed in: ""So happy for you both! You deserve all the love and happiness.""

""I was a doubter but I am thrilled to see that I have been proved wrong,"" added a fifth.

When Jessie and Will came out of the Love Island villa earlier this year they cheekily revealed that sex was a ""˜million times better' in the real world.

The fan favourites were dumped from the villa after a compatibility vote failed in their favour. Despite losing out, the pair have continued to pursue their relationship.

Jessie has been staying with Will's family on their farm in Buckinghamshire - and has even been helping out with the lambing season.

Earlier this month, Jessie shared her plans to return to her native Australia - and it looks like she is hoping to take Will with her.

""I am looking to go back to Australia at the end of May because I think that's when my visa is until.

""Will might be coming with me, which is really exciting, and then we're going to look at what other types of visas I can have when I get back over here,"" she told The Sun.

Jessie added she could see herself living in the UK ""long-term"", but only if her farmer boyfriend ""doesn't enjoy Australia too much"".

Husband and wife duo Giles Wood and Mary Killen were surprised to learn three spirits were trapped inside their Wiltshire home - so they called in an exorcist to get rid of them

Gogglebox stars Giles Wood and Mary Killen ain't afraid of no ghost - because they have found a great exorcist to evict a ghoul from their home.

The reality star couple were concerned that spirits had joined them in their home - which regularly appears on the hit Channel 4 reality show.

And apparently they were right - as exorcism expert Georgia Coleridge discovered no less than three ghosts within their four walls.

Professional artist Giles has raved about Georgia's accomplishments after she helped banish the spirits of a boy, and elderly woman, and a farm worker from the home he shares with author wife Mary.

Speaking to the Daily Star about the unexpected housemates, Giles explained how the three spirits were discovered in the home and how Georgia helped them move on.

He said: ""She identified three ghosts of former occupants. None of them malign but all of them ""˜stuck'.

""One, who had sat huddled at the fireplace for many years, ""˜was a simple fellow, he didn't think much.' If we consider the low expectations of agricultural workers of the previous centuries, the lack of stimuli, education or even curiosity, this could only be expected.

""Another was a boy of 16. The third an old lady who had lived during Queen Victoria's reign.""

Giles went on: ""Georgia moved them onwards and upwards. She encouraged the boy to go to a ""˜country fair' and an angel came to take the very old lady.

""She also expelled a cohort of nature spirits in the kitchen (where Mary and I argue the most) and I helped by enthusiastically swishing a smoking sagebrush torch in the direction of the back door, which had been opened to allow the exeunt omnes.""

He went on to explain that he was thrilled to assist Georgia in her exorcism process and said he also believes the spirits had become ""˜trapped' in a state of purgatory in his Wiltshire home.

In a recent episode of Gogglebox, fans were left stunned when Mary turned the air blue with a swear word.

The couple were reviewing the Netflix TV show Beef, when Giles said one of the actors looked like the people 'tutting in a queue in Waitrose '.

Speaking about the character, he said: ""He'd be sent to that problem desk which I always avoid, somewhere in the middle of Waitrose where there's always people queuing and gutting.

""Do you remember that place? Where they express dissatisfaction?""

But Mary was mildly offended and defended the supermarket, exclaiming: ""Oh you're just such a ba****d. Waitrose is beautifully run, there's never a queue of people gutting.""

Giles went on to ask his wife whether she worked for the supermarket chain and added: ""I think you are on a retainer""¦""

Fans were shocked at hearing Mary swear and took to social media to comment on the moment.

""Mary calling Giles a b*****d for complaining about Waitrose bit harsh,"" one user complained.

Model Nayeli Tapia, 22, singer Yuliana Macias, 21, and student Denisse Reyna, 19, were found in the bottom of a shallow burial pit on the banks of a river near Quininde, Ecuador, by local fishermen in early April

The aunt of a model who was one of three young women whose throats were slit before being dumped in a shallow grave has hit back over rumours that the trio were linked to narco-traffickers.

Nayeli Tapia, 22, Yuliana Macias, 21, and Denisse Reyna, 19, were found by a group of local fishermen after they spotted a dog prowling around an area on a river bank near Quininde, Ecuador in early April.

Cops rushed to the scene where they exhumed the three bodies - each of which was tied up, with its mouth covered and throat slit.

Speaking with local media, Yuliana's aunt begged the public ""not to accuse people who have nothing to do with [drug trafficking]"".

After the grisly murders, rumours abounded, including that the girls were killed after getting caught up with shady characters from the country's cartels.

In a relatively recent development, Ecuador, which neighbours major cocaine-producing countries and is rife with corruption, has become a hotbed of drug crime, according to the International Crisis Group.

Yuliana's aunt, Paulina Rueda, added: ""All we want is justice, and if the public knows, they should report who is responsible for this horrible murder, because it's three murders in one day.""

Paulina said that she and other relatives have been threatened during their campaign for justice.

She said: ""I will stand until the last consequences, despite the fact that my life has been in danger since yesterday.""

Yesterday, chilling text messages emerged, some of the last communications by the group slain during a trip to the beach.

In the hours before they vanished, two of the women sent messages to loved ones warning they were in danger.

A translation of one text read: ""I feel that something is going to happen.""

The women's family and friends told how Nayeli, who had a four-year-old daughter, sent her sister a WhatsApp message with her live location at 11.10pm on April 4.

It read: ""I'm just sending you just in case,"" and she was not heard from again.

The location was later proven to be close to where the three women were found dead, according to the publication.

Denisse messaged a friend in her final hours which read: ""I feel that something is going to happen and if something happens to me, remember that I love you very much.""

It is believed the women were tortured, killed and buried on April 5.

Relatives said they were from Santo Domingo with similar hopes and dreams for the future.

Two of the women wanted to leave the country in search of a better future and they all left happy and smiling, it was said.

After their disappearance, it was initially thought they had been hired for a musical presentation.

But the theory was ruled out by relatives who said the last thing they knew was that the women would travel to the beach with some friends.

On the day of their fateful trip, a black Sail car picked up Denisse at around 9am after she was invited to the Casa Blanca hotel in Same.

At that time, she was not sure whether or not to go to the beach and preferred to say that she was going to have some breakfast.

It later emerged that Denisse and the driver picked up Nayeli on AlÃ³ag road, since she came from Quito.

In the afternoon, Denisse returned to her house with her friend to confirm the trip.

At night, Yuliana joined and told her relatives that she would be meeting a friend.

The young woman uploaded a WhatsApp status of the girls singing in a car and it is not know what happened next.

Their corpses showed signs of torture and had injuries caused by sharp weapons, perhaps machetes. All three were handcuffed.

Diego Velastegui of the Quininde Police, told local press: ""They were young, had beach clothes, bathing suits, light clothing, shorts.""

The remains were transferred to the morgue, then handed over to their relatives who confirmed that they were Yuliana, Denisse and Nayeli.

Their relatives bravely decided to speak out to tell their stories and the dreams they had in life.

Nayeli grew up in Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas but lived in Quito and worked as a model.

Yuliana was a singing student.

While Denisse was studying Agricultural Engineering at the State Technical University of Quevedo.

Sophie, the Duchess of Edinburgh, is an incredibly popular member of the Royal Family - but the way she came to meet her future husband Prince Edward was entirely down to chance

The Duchess of Edinburgh is one of the most popular members of the Royal Family who is often heralded as King Charles' 'secret weapon'.

As well as regularly supporting her key charitable interests that stretch from avoidable blindness to gender equality, Sophie has grown to become one of the most important figures in the King's line-up of senior royals in the 24 years since she married into the Firm. Sophie's introduction into royal life was unexpected to say the least and ultimately down to a stroke of luck when a well-known BBC presenter changed her plans - and the now duchess was forced to step in.

The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh first met in 1993 at Queen's Tennis Club in London when they were involved in the Prince Edward Summer Challenge. At the time, Sophie was working on the PR for the event with MacLaurin Communications. Brian McLaurin, Sophie's boss, came up with the idea to have a photo call at the event to drum up interest in the Prince's Challenge, which was linked to the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme.

A promotional campaign was set to be launched with former tennis star and BBC presenter Sue Barker. However, an hour before the meeting was due to take place, Brian got a call that Sue was unable to attend and he decided to ask his co-worker Sophie to take part in the shoot alongside the prince.

Once the photos had been taken, Sophie handed the prince her number in case any problems with the challenge arose or if Brian could not be contacted. Prince Edward had other ideas as he invited her to play a game of real tennis and for dinner at his apartment at Buckingham Palace. The pair announced their engagement six years later on January 6, 1999.

Ahead of their wedding, the palace announced that the pair would be styled as the Earl and Countess of Wessex. To mark Prince Edward's 59th birthday in March of this year, it was announced that King Charles had decided to make the couple the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh.

When Sophie is not carrying out her official duties on behalf of the King, her main areas of interest include supporting young people with disabilities, eradicating avoidable blindness, agriculture, fashion and the prevention of sexual violence in conflicted areas.

The Duchess has travelled to several countries to raise and spread awareness for these organisations in her role as patron or global ambassador. Sophie undertook a visit to India and Qatar in honour of World Sight Day in 2013 to witness the global issues surrounding preventable blindness first-hand. In 2019, she travelled to Kenya on International Women's Day in aid of gender equality, girls' education and the prevention of sexual violence.

Along with her husband, Sophie has taken up an important role in co-running the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme. The Duchess even undertook a 450-mile cycle ride from Edinburgh to Buckingham Palace as her Diamond Challenge for the scheme. Away from her public role, she lives near to Windsor Castle at Bagshot Park in Surrey with her husband and two children, Lady Louise Windsor and James, Earl of Wessex.

Matthew and Charis Watkinson moved from Essex to Wales to live off grid and have a low ecological footprint. At Beeview Farm in Newport, south Wales, they grow their own fruit and vegetables

A family of four living on a farm faces constant threats from their neighbours who bought the access lane to their home and say they cannot pass through it.

Matthew and Charis Watkinson bought the land in Newport, southwest Wales, in 2011 and, in 2016, made a planning application to build a sustainable home for their family.

However, since then Matthew say there was a fallout with their neighbours Ian and Vivienne Ward, who bought the land which provides access to the farm.

According to the Watkinsons, the retired couple then began threatening to sue them for trespassing each time they drive through the road to go home.

Mr Watkinson told The Mirror: ""We weren't expecting people to buy this bit of land as it is a right of way.

""The access lane runs past their house and a bit further.""

Mr Watkinson said relationships with their neighbours have always been ""unpleasant"", but constant threats since they bought the access lane have made their lives much more stressful.

The father-of-two added that the worst part of the tensions is that he feels like his neighbours want to ""get rid of our kids"", who go to school in the area and love their life at Beeview Farm - a 3-acre site in Pembrokeshire.

He said his younger son Billy has never lived in any other place as the family were already based on the farm when he was born.

The Watkinsons were surprised at first as they were not expecting their neighbours to buy the access lane and claim they are trying to stop them accessing their farm as ""they only want sheep"" in the area.

And Matthew fears some neighbours have taken a dislike to the sustainable project - and the family's success.

Back in 2016, the Watkinsons joined the Welsh One Planet Development Planning Policy - a scheme adopted by the Welsh government that provides an affordable and sustainable way for people to live and work on their own land, aiming to bring social, economic and environmental benefits.

The scheme allows families to build houses on green-belt land, as long as they operate on zero carbon. The idea is that, when households reduce their own ecological footprints, this in turn helps the country reduce its overall footprint.

And the family's off-the-grid lifestyle allows them to live with just such a low ecological footprint.

Mr Watkinson said: ""We feel like we're doing a pioneering project, which is fulfilling and rewarding.

""We want to show that an off-grid life with a low environmental footprint is possible.""

On their farm - that was built from scratch by Matthew and Charis - the two parents and their children grow fruit and vegetables, brew nettle beer and take baths in a homemade wood-fired hot tub.

They also have a hand-powered washing machine and a gas cooker that functions on horse manure.

The only electrical items the family have are a TV, mobile phones and a small fridge-freezer.

Their kids Elsa, eight, and Billy, five, regularly join their parents on the farm to help them with agricultural tasks including planting veggies and fruit, as well as picking them when they are ripe.

After starting their project, the family had five years to prove that they could reach their targets and live sustainably, in order to keep their planning permission.

However, Mr Watkinson said his neighbours bought the access lane as they were ""unhappy"" that they reached their target.

He explained: ""Some neighbours have taken a dislike to our project and there was a fallout over our planning application.

""Our neighbours, who were unhappy that we hit our target, managed to buy the land to get access to the farm.""

Despite tensions with their neighbours, the Watkinsons are living on the farm as normal because there is no court injunction at the moment.

However, they fear their neighbours will take them to court and they cannot afford legal fees due to their lifestyle.

The couple launched a GoFundMe page to raise money for to employ a solicitor and a barrister to defend their land.

The Watkinsons are urging anyone who regularly uses the historical roads to and from Carningli Common on the lanes around Castle Hill to contact the council in a bid to have the roads officially registered as public rights of way so that they can be used without being threatened with court action.

The couple, who previously worked as vets in Essex but moved to Wales to live more a sustainable life, said: ""The current owners are trying to turn these ancient rights of way into permissive rights of way so they can deny some residents and visitors access along them.

""This is unacceptable. These routes need to be protected for all current and future generations.""

The family added: ""Public rights are being lost all over the place (see Dartmoor) and we'd like to apply to have all these ones officially recognised before they're removed by our neighbours.

""They've already locked one gate to stop people using an old path to the common land!""

Their GoFundMe appeal says: ""Hello, we are Matthew, Charis, Elsa and Billy Watkinson and we live on Beeview Farm.

""Beeview Farm is a 3-acre site in Pembrokeshire, Wales. We were granted planning permission through the Welsh One Planet Development Planning Policy.

""This policy requires us to have an agricultural business, build a zero-carbon dwelling, grow most of our own food, and live with a low ecological footprint.

""Our neighbours bought our access lane and are now threatening to sue us for trespass and harassment to stop us farming and living in this way.

""Due to our low-impact, off-grid lifestyle we do not have the funds to pay for legal defence, and so we humbly ask for any amount you can donate that will go directly towards the legal costs involved in the process.""

Charis and Matthew have raised £13,200 of their £10,000 goal. They said: ""Thank you again to everyone who has donated so far.

""We're quite overwhelmed, to be honest. Thank you.""

Mr and Mrs Ward could not be reached for comment, but The Mirror has approached their solicitors.

Pembrokeshire County Council did not comment on the story.

A Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority spokesman told The Mirror: ""Pedestrian access on the lanes around Castle Hill to Carningli Common is permitted by the landowner and managed by the National Park Authority.

""The registration of public rights of way along these lanes would be a matter for Pembrokeshire County Council to investigate, as they are the local highway authority with the legal responsibility for such matters.""

The British Meat Processors Association (BMPA), which represents the meat processing industry, has warned that festive treats could be off the menu due to strikes by Government vets in Northern Ireland

Warnings have been issued over a potential shortage of pigs in blankets and ham this Christmas.

The British Meat Processors Association (BMPA), which represents the meat processing industry, has warned that festive treats could be off the menu due to strikes by Government vets in Northern Ireland. Vets are currently in the middle of five-day industrial action over pay, which will last until this Friday (November 3).

Union members of the Veterinary Service Animal Health Group (VSAHG) and the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (NIPSA) are involved in the strike. During this time, the association said ""no slaughter of cattle, pigs, sheep and poultry can take place across the whole of Northern Ireland"" because Government vets will not be on-site in abattoirs.

The BMPA warned the impact of a five-day stoppage could last for months. Nick Allen, CEO of the BMPA said: ""It will mean that meat plants will have to cease operations, causing loss of income for those businesses, and disrupting food supply chains.

""This is a particular worry as we enter the busiest period of the year in the run-up to Christmas when our members are preparing festive products like hams and pigs-in-blankets for the Christmas market. It could also prove sensitive for the UK government which is currently working on an agreement with the DUP over the Windsor Framework. The vets' walkout could expose the scale of border checks that are still needed to get food from the UK mainland to Northern Ireland - even through the new ""˜green lane' - and will demonstrate that the Irish Sea border has not been removed.""

Separately, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) has warned the industrial action ""is likely to present issues in relation to animal health and welfare, public health and continuity of agri-food supply chains"". It added in a statement: ""The Department fully respects the rights of colleagues to take industrial action and regrets sincerely that the budget situation that civil servants are trying their best to manage has meant that it has not been possible to provide a meaningful pay award for NI Civil Service staff.""

Andrew Opie, Director of Food and Sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: ""These strikes are only affecting a small part of the UK's supply chain. Retailers are adept at dealing with disruption and will do everything they can to ensure supply lines aren't impacted.""

Lolita, once deemed the 'world's loneliest whale,' was held captive for more than half-century and had been forced to perform at the Miami Seaquarium for over 50 years

Lolita the killer whale has tragically died just days after a Miami aquarium claimed she was in ""good health.""

The captive whale, who was held for more than a half-century, passed away on Friday at the Miami Seaquarium just as she was being prepared to move from the theme park in the not-too-distant future.

The Seaquarium posted a statement from the non-profit group Friends of Toki on social media that Lolita ""” also known as Tokitae, or Toki ""” started exhibiting serious signs of discomfort over the past two days.

Seaquarium and Friends of Toki medical team members began treating her immediately and aggressively, but the 57-year-old orca died from an apparent renal condition, the statement said.

For all the latest news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US

""Toki was an inspiration to all who had the fortune to hear her story and especially to the Lummi nation that considered her family,"" the Friends of Toki statement said. ""Those who have had the privilege to spend time with her will forever remember her beautiful spirit.""

Animal rights activists have been fighting for years to have Lolita freed from her tank at the Miami Seaquarium. The park's relatively new owner, The Dolphin Company, and the non-profit Friends of Toki announced a plan in March to possibly move her to a natural sea pen in the Pacific Northwest, with the financial backing of Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay.

""I am heartbroken that Toki has left us,"" Irsay said in a statement. ""Her story captured my heart, just as it did millions of others. I was honoured to be part of the team working to return her to her indigenous home, and I take solace in knowing that we significantly improved her living conditions this past year. Her spirit and grace have touched so many. Rest in peace, dear Toki.""

The Lummi Nation, a Native American tribe based in Washington state, refers to orcas as ""qwe 'lhol mechen,"" which means ""our relations below the waves."" The tribe has spent years working to secure Lolita's release and to return to her home waters.

""The Lummi Nation is saddened by the news that our beloved Orca relative has passed away at the estimated age of 57 years old,"" Chairman Tony Hillaire said in a statement. ""Our hearts are with all those impacted by this news; our hearts are with her family. We stand in solidarity with our Lummi members who poured their hearts and souls into bringing Sk'aliCh'elh-tenaut home.""

Lolita retired from performing last spring as a condition of the park's new exhibitor's license with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. She's not been publicly displayed since. In recent months, new upgrades had been installed to better filter the pool and regulate her water temperature.

Federal and state regulators would have had to approve any plan to move Lolita, and that could have taken months or years. The 5,000-pound had been living for years in a tank that measures 80 feet by 35 feet and is 20 feet deep.

WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT An investigation by the Daily Mirror has unveiled the horrors of thousands of cats snatched from their owners in Vietnam before being sold for their meat

Caged cats howl in terror as they watch a man swoop in with a set of barbaric-looking pincers and yank one out by the scruff of its neck.

After repeatedly bludgeoning the ginger animal, he plunges it in boiling hot water then throws the body into a defurring machine.

Every year a million cats are slaughtered in this manner before being cooked and served up in restaurants - part of a cruel and dangerous meat trade in Vietnam.

Many are beloved pets and owners live in constant fear of cat snatchers who swipe thousands a day to fuel this lucrative and ­international crime network. Black cats are particularly targeted for their apparent ­medicinal value.

While the eating of dog meat in Asia is widely known, the sinister and hideous trade in stolen cats for the pot, known locally as 'thit meo', or little tiger, is not so much.

These images will be hard for any animal lover to stomach but the Mirror has decided to publish them in the hope it will help bring an end to this cruelty.

Rahul Sehga, from Soi Dog, an ­organisation that put an end to the dog and cat meat trade in Thailand in 2014, said: ""This year has been declared the Year of the Cat in Vietnam, with felines hailed as symbols of protection and good luck. It is time they were treated accordingly.

""The cats are stolen from outside loving homes and the streets before being transported in terrible conditions and ­slaughtered in view of one another using the crudest methods.

""Each point of the trade involves close contact between humans and these scared animals and therefore possible exposure to diseases.""

The World Health Organisation has warned cat and dog meat is a threat to public health with the risk of rabies, trichinellosis and zoonotic diseases - viruses such as Covid which jump from animals to humans.

On the streets of the capital Hanoi, we found restaurant owners hacking cooked cats and dogs while filthy cages crammed full of petrified animals looked on.

Many of the cats were still wearing their collars. On top of one cage lay a blood-stained chopping board and cleaver.

As I put my hand through the bars of another cage, many ­desperately wanted to be touched and miaowed for help. Others were too exhausted and had given up the fight.

HOW TO DONATE

According to Soi Dog Foundation, an international charity aimed at ending the slaughter of pets for food, one dog is killed every single single in Asia for the dinner table.

The cause carries out raids to rescue cats and dogs who have been caged for slaughter, and you can help with even the smallest donation. The charity also allows people to sponsor cats and dogs which have been rescued.

Dozens were ill with wounds, laboured breathing and bloody noses after they had been trafficked across the country in sacks in journeys lasting days - sometimes weeks - without food and water. Blowtorched cats and dogs lay on the floor next to them.

A terrified white moggie with one blue and one green eye was panting, dehydrated in the 37C heat, while a tabby wearing a purple collar looked haunted.

When I returned the next morning, these two cats were missing. In the Ha Dong district, motorbikes speed along the street while shutters start to open at the cat restaurants.

By 7am we have witnessed one seller batter five animals to death,
in view of the passers-by who don't look twice.

Experts say that while both dogs and cats are prone to stress, felines are exceptionally sensitive.

Soi Dog head of animal welfare Dr Ala Izydorczyk said stress causes immunosuppression, so cats are more susceptible to infectious disease.

'Terrified'

She added: ""These cats suffer immense and prolonged stress from the minute they are rough handled during capture to confinement in overcrowded boxes, sacks and cages.

""Their sensitive sense of smell and hearing means that they are alert to the fact others are being slaughtered nearby, leaving them terrified.""

Cats are called little tigers in Vietnam, due to their supposed healing properties. The exact origins of eating them are unknown but data suggests it has increased in popularity only in the past decade.

Eating cats and dogs became routine during the war, which brought famine to parts of the country. But today cat meat is perceived as an increasingly exotic, speciality dish, which supposedly has healing powers.

The meat costs £8 per kilo. Chicken costs £1.30 per kilo and pork is £3.90. Around five million dogs are killed a year for their meat, which is £4.55 a kilo. The slaughter and consumption of cats was banned in 1998 in an attempt to encourage ownership to keep the rat population under control.

But these protections were revoked in January 2020, leading to a surge in restaurants. The trade now consists of a network of thieves, restaurants and slaughterhouses. One huge ­warehouse raided earlier this year was found to have been processing 500 cats a night for the past 10 years.

A survey conducted by the charity Four Paws found up to 95% of ­Vietnamese think eating dog and cat meat is not part of their culture. And 88% support a ban on the trade.

Soi Dog, run by Brit John Dalley, is lobbying to introduce laws to close the trade down. This month, it joined nearly 50 Vietnamese politicians for a milestone meeting where it discussed making Hanoi the first cat and dog meat-free city.

It said: ""We will continue to fight for the creation of a legal ­framework so that cats and dogs are no longer subjected to this horrific cruelty.""

The Department of Agriculture's Ta Van Tuong admitted: ""Phasing out dog and cat meat is key to attracting more tourists, who are increasingly caring about the environment and animal welfare conditions.""

'Ticking time bombs'

In 2019 Vietnam was visited by 18 million holidaymakers, a major contributor to the economy.

Matt ­Backhouse, Four Paws' head of stray animal care in Southeast Asia, added: ""The combined animal welfare issues of the dog and cat meat trade, and live animal markets, are ticking time bombs.

""If governments don't act to stop the brutal trade now and shut down the cruel markets, it is a case of when, not if, the next global pandemic originates from Vietnam.""

Opinion: Most horrific story I've covered in 20 years

In Vietnam, 2023 is the year of the cat, and the animals are hailed as symbols of protection and good luck.

Every bar, shop and restaurant has a waving cat ornament at their entrance, believed to have been bringing good fortune for centuries.

But in parts of this country, eating cat meat - particularly at the end of the lunar month - is thought to ward off bad luck, boost libido and even to gain the agility of the animal.

I've been a journalist for 20 years and have travelled the world to cover heartbreaking stories such as babies being sold in Romania and the ruthless poaching of elephants and rhinos in Uganda.

I've also sat through hundreds of hours of often sickening undercover footage from slaughterhouses, fur and factory farms.

But the cat meat trade here is the most upsetting experience of my career.

Many of my friends have questioned why a cat lover like myself would want to witness the horrors firsthand. Some even told me not to send any pictures, as they couldn't bear to see animals suffering.

Watching five cats being subjected to the most horrific, long and torturous death was awful but documenting this side of the industry is crucial in helping to end the cruelty.

King Charles and Queen Camilla will appear at a rare joint engagement with Sophie, the new Duchess of Edinburgh - and there have been many hints about the fun friendship between the monarch and his sister-in-law

They rarely carry out engagements together as their busy diaries often see them at opposite ends of the country - and sometimes the world.

But later today King Charles will team up with his sister-in-law Sophie, the Duchess of Edinburgh, to host a very special event at Windsor Castle, where, along with Queen Camilla, they will celebrate the work of William Shakespeare.

In their handful of public appearances together, there has been several interactions between the monarch and the duchess that have spoken volumes about their friendly, and at times playful bond. Since marrying her husband Prince Edward, Sophie has become a pillar of the Royal Family - and was even dubbed a ""second daughter"" of the late Queen thanks to their close relationship.

But despite the Queen's sad death last year, Sophie has maintained her position as a much-loved member of Charles' slimmed-down monarchy. Here, we take a look at the bond they share...

Early days

Sophie's introduction to the Royal Family came in 1999 when she married Edward in a spectacular wedding at Windsor Castle. Charles was at his younger brother's side as a supporter when he tied the knot with his bride.

Sophie, a former PR exec who once worked for Capital Radio, was born Sophie Rhys-Jones and like the Princess of Wales hails from a posh background with her parents sending her to private schools.

She and Edward were brought together by a mutual passion for the ancient sport of real tennis and romance blossomed between the pair.

They now have two children Lady Louise Windsor, 19, and 15-year-old James, Earl of Wessex.

Controversy

However, Sophie's early royal life was not without controversy and problems arose when she tried to combine her life as a royal with her professional career.

She was caught in a ""fake sheikh"" sting and accused of trying to use her status to promote her public relations business.

The ""Sophiegate"" newspaper controversy was hugely damaging, resulting in reports of indiscreet remarks about a string of public figures including Sir Tony Blair and Lord Hague.

It led to a lengthy inquiry into how working royals should be regulated and Sophie and Edward later stepped down from their individual careers to become full-time royals.

Bond with Queen

But despite early problems, Sophie forged a special bond with her mother-in-law the late Queen - which will have no doubt endeared her to her brother-in-law Charles.

Living just 10 miles away from Windsor Castle at their residence in Bagshot Park, Surrey, Sophie, Edward and their children frequently visited the Queen and would spend time together on long dog walks.

Sophie reportedly leant on Her Majesty when her own mother passed away in 2005 and they became close confidants.

The Queen personally invited her to travel to several church services and they're said to have watched old movies together.

And in 2021, following the death of Prince Philip, a royal source said Sophie had been a ""tremendous source of comfort to the Queen.""

When the Queen died last September, Sophie appeared devastated as she viewed the floral tributes left to the late monarch outside Balmoral.

Trusted worker

Since the late Queen died and Charles came to the throne, Sophie has remained among his trusted working royals that carry out engagements on behalf of the Firm - and has even been dubbed its ""secret weapon"".

In the past year, she's carried out trips to the United Nations in New York to talk about violence against women and girls - and even became the first royal to visit the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Her position in the royal family has become increasingly more important since the departure of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and in recent years she has chosen to highlight challenging issues.

In 2019 she publicly committed herself to supporting the UK's work helping victims of rape, sexual violence and exploitation in war.

In total, she is patron of more than 70 charities and organisations, with interests including agriculture, fashion, supporting people with disabilities, and the prevention of avoidable blindness in developing countries.

A source previously told the Mirror: ""Sophie's growing popularity with the public is also evident and she will take on a larger public profile in a new-look monarchy of King Charles.""

Playful moments

But it's not all work and no play for Charles and Sophie, and there have been several playful moments between the pair hinting at their fondness of each other.

Last year at Royal Ascot, they were seen sharing a joke with each other, and body language expert Judi James believes it showed their closeness.

She explained: ""Charles is spatially close to Sophie, leaving a large gap between himself and Camilla. Sophie tends to get on with most of the royals and appears to be trusted at a very high level.

""She and Charles are seen roaring with laughter here and when Charles moves in to kiss her as they greet she seems to perform a rather cheeky facial expression, suggesting they are close friends.

""Sophie's open-mouthed smile involves a rounding and a raising of the cheeks, making it look genuine and Charles' face is wreathed in creases that suggest good humour in her company.""

Meanwhile, Judi also spotted another very telling moment at the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey earlier this year, which was one of Sophie's first outings since Charles bestowed her and husband Edward the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh titles.

In a blink-and-you-'ll-miss-it moment, a playful Sophie appeared to jokingly shoulder-bump Charles, who appeared eager to get on with proceedings.

She explained: ""Whether it was the upgrade to Duchess of Edinburgh or maybe just a response to Charles' slightly impatient-looking dithering as he waited to get on with the procession, but Sophie leant right in to give Charles a very playful shoulder-bump greeting, along with a very meaningful grin.""

Ike and Beatrice Ekweremadu along with their 25-year-old daughter Sonia faced trial at the Old Bailey. The parents were found guilty but the jury found Sonia not guilty

A wealthy couple who planned to traffic a young man into the UK so they could harvest his kidney for their sick daughter have been sentenced.

Ike Ekweremadu was given nine years and eight months in the first successful UK prosecution for an organ harvesting plot, alongside his wife Beatrice, who was jailed for four and a half years and Dr Obinna Obeta, who was jailed for 10 years.

Ike and Beatrice Ekweremadu along with their 25-year-old daughter Sonia faced trial at the Old Bailey.

In a televised sentencing on Friday, Mr Justice Johnson recognised Ike Ekweremadu's ""substantial fall from grace"".

The senior judge said: ""People-trafficking across international borders for the harvesting of human organs is a form of slavery.

""It treats human beings and their body parts as commodities to be bought and sold.

""It is a trade that preys on poverty, misery and desperation.""

He told the defendants: ""You each played a part in that despicable trade.""

On the question of harm to the victim if the intended transplant went ahead, he said: ""He would have faced spending the rest of his life with only one kidney and without the requisite funding for the required aftercare.""

He added the risks had not been properly explained and there had been no consent ""in any meaningful sense"".

Previously the court heard Nigerian senator Ike, 60, his wife Beatrice, 56, were accused of conspiring to traffic a young man to Britain for his body parts.

They faced the accusations along with medical ""middleman"" Dr Obinna Obeta, 50, who was also found guilty, and were said to have created an ""elaborate"" back story to try and get away with it, utilising their connections to get the donor a visa.

Daughter Sonia wept back in March as she was cleared of the same charges after the jury deliberated for nearly 14 hours.

The court heard that the 21-year-old street trader from Lagos was to be rewarded for donating a kidney to Sonia in an £80,000 private procedure at the Royal free Hospital in London.



But he was later rejected as unsuitable, despite the extensive efforts the family were said to have gone to get him, and it was alleged that the Ekweremadus then changed their donor search to Turkey after doctors refused them.

While it is lawful for someone to donate a kidney, it is criminal to reward someone for doing so, jurors heard.

When asked why they didn't go to a member of their own family for the kidney, the prosecution said it was because the wealthy couple wanted the ""risk to go to someone you don't know"".

An investigation was launched after the young man ran away from London and slept rough for days before walking into a police station more than 20 miles away Staines in Surrey, crying and in distress.

The Ekweremadus, who have an address in Willesden Green, north-west London, and Dr Obeta, from Southwark, south London, denied the charges against them before being found guilty.

As part of the plot, ""elaborate"" steps were taken to create the lie that Sonia and her proposed donor were cousins, it is claimed.

During the trial, prosecutor Hugh Davies KC, told jurors: ""Most parents, whether powerful or not in society, will do whatever is necessary to alleviate suffering in their child.

""The Ekweremadus were no different: the evidence - from downloads from their mobile phones, and wider actions - demonstrates a close, open and loving family each with an understandable and direct interest in Sonia's medical treatment.""

During the hearing, the victim, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said he only found out what was planned when he was taken to the north London hospital for an initial consultation.

In a statement read to court: ""I would never (have) agreed to any of this.

""My body is not for sale.""

He spoke of his fears for his own safety and that of his family in Nigeria who had been visited and told to ""drop"" the case.

He said: ""I cannot think about going home to Nigeria.

""These people are extremely powerful and I worry for my family.

""Even though I live here in the UK at the moment I know I need to be careful too.

""I have no-one here, no family, no friends.

""I am having to start my life again.

""I'm worried about my family in Nigeria but I have been told my dad had been visited and was told to drop the case in the UK.""

He told police he did not want to claim compensation from the ""bad people"" as it would be ""cursed and bad luck"".

He said: ""My plan now is to work and to get an education and to play football.""

It is the first time anyone has been convicted under the Modern Slavery Act of an organ-harvesting conspiracy.

Scotland Yard declined to say whether more charges would be brought but said the investigation was ongoing.

Police have highlighted soaring numbers of modern slavery cases in recent years with a small number involving organ harvesting.

Detective Superintendent Andy Furphy said: ""Human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal is relatively rare in the UK, but what we have seen since the victim's bravery is that this is now not the only investigation of that nature taking place in London.

""Although organ harvesting forms a very small percentage of modern slavery, human trafficking, we're now starting to see more people coming forward.

""The victim of this case, a very brave young man, was exploited due to his vulnerable economic circumstances, by people that were powerful, wealthy, and that exerted control and dominance over him bringing into the UK for purposes of taking his kidney.

""Their motivation was to get a kidney for their daughter, without any thought of the process that that involved, any thought of aftercare, any thought for the victim of the modern slavery offence at all.""

Joshua Hunt, 32, has been convicted for wearing a plastic-clad outfit and terrifying victims but two women believe that the original ""Somerset Gimp"" may be still at large

Two victims of the ""Somerset Gimp"" are ""terrified"" that the original culprit is still at large and that he ""could know where we live"".

The women say they have ""nightmares and flashbacks"" over the incident where they came across plastic-clad Joshua Hunt who has now been convicted. Sam Farmer and Chloe Smith were driving down a country lane in May near Bleadon, north Somerset, after finishing work at midnight when they were confronted by Hunt in the middle of the road.

Mum-of-two Sam, 37, from Weston Super-Mare, said: ""It was out of a nightmare. He had drawn a face on his gimp mask with an illuminous pen. So all we could see was a man in a gimp suit in the middle of the road with a terrifying smile and drawn-on eyes.

""Behind us was a pitch-black country lane. And in front of us, he was stood with really low-lit lights behind him. Like a horror film. He was completely still, just staring at us. Not moving and had his hands behind his back so I had no idea if he had a weapon."" Hunt, 32, who was found guilty of public order offences last month, confirmed in court that he was the masked man who had frightened passing drivers in north Somerset on two nights in May but claimed: ""The outfit I wear is not anything to do with the gimp.""

Police said he had done internet searches in 2022 and 2023 about the ""Somerset Gimp"" and the ""Gimp of Cleeve"". Now Chloe and Sam believe ""deranged"" Hunt was a copycat, with the ""real"" Somerset gimp is still on the prowl, reported the Daily Star.

Sam added: ""I know he has been convicted but I think Joshua Hunt is a copycat. The real Somerset Gimp could still be out there. Having seen previous videos and pictures of the so-called Somerset Gimp, it just looks like a different body shape, a different man. I'm terrified the real gimp is still out there. Near my home, targeting us. I have flashbacks all of the time. I have nightmares.""

Chloe, 23, added: ""He could know where we live, this could not be over. And that thought is terrifying."" The pair say their lives have changed as a result of the incident, and have even left their jobs due to the terror and stress they have felt ever since. Sam added: ""We have quit our jobs and found new ones because the memories affect us so much. I cannot stress how much this deranged man has affected me. This has changed my life.""

Joshua Hunt, 32, was found guilty of causing intentional harassment, alarm or distress to his victims. He has now been handed a sexual harm risk order, which prevents him from wearing any type of mask unless for medical reasons. The order will be in place for five years.

Imposing the sexual harm risk order at Bristol Magistrates' Court earlier, District Judge Joanna Dickens said: ""[The incidents] are clearly acts of a sexual nature with a sexual element to them."" She continued: ""A sexual risk order is quite a serious order, and it has a lot of obligations of you and if you breach this order you can go to prison. I only make an order if I think it is necessary to protect the public from you and I do think it is necessary.""

Among the restrictions imposed, Hunt is now banned from:

Restrictions have also been placed upon Hunt's computer use and access to the internet.

Several of the cast from the hit TV show have passed away in recent years - with some dying young, and others fighting cancer and struggling with issues such as homelessness and alcoholism

Former Grange Hill star George Armstrong died on July 11 at the age of 60 following a 'long battle with Leukaemia'.

The actor, who played Alan Humphries, was a key character between 1978 and 1982 for the first five series of the show, before he joined Todd Carty's character Tucker Jenkins for the spin-off series, Tucker's Luck. He eventually left acting to become a Technical Theatre Manager at a public school.

News of his death was shared on Twitter by a fan account, who posted: ""I've just heard the very sad news that George Armstrong aka Alan Humphries passed away yesterday. RIP George. A true Grange Hill legend xxxx.""

But George isn't the only tragedy that has plagued the former cast of Grange Hill, with another star sadly passing away in 2016 at the age of 53.

Mark Farmer

Mark Farmer passed away in April 2016 at the age of 53 after reportedly battling cancer. The actor, who was best known for playing football-loving Gary Hargreaves on the show in seasons two to four.

News of his death was announced on a Grange Hill Twitter account, which posted: ""It is with great sadness we report that Mark Farmer aka Gary Hargreaves died earlier today. RIP.""

Fans of the show flocked to social media to share their messages of grief, with one person writing: ""Sad news Mark Farmer AKA Gary Hargreaves in Grange Hill has died aged just 53. Grange Hill football captain fancied by all the girls.""

Another said: ""@GrangeHillGold sad news Mark Farmer aka Gary Hargreaves sadly passed away this morning. .R.I.P. X""

Terry Sue-Patt

Terry, who played Benny Green for four years on the show, was found dead at his London home in May 2015. His family released a statement shortly after, claiming he'd been fighting demons before his death.

""Like every artist and creative soul in history, he drew from his demons and they sometimes got the better of him,"" it read.

""Terry had his own crosses to bear and he became gripped by a depression he never fully recovered from.

""Terry's successful and eventful life was tragically cut short. He was our cherished son, brother, uncle, and friend and will be sadly missed.""

Michelle Herbert

Michelle played bad girl Trisha Yates on Grange Hill for four years but stepped away from the limelight after her stint on the show, but made a brief return as Trisha, in the final episode of Tucker's Luck. After this, she quit acting completely and started working for a sweet manufacturer.

She later battled breast cancer after finding a dimple on her breast in May 2015. An ultrasound and biopsy found that she had a medium-growth tumour ""which was 6mm in size.""

Michelle had to endure a lumpectomy and then a mastectomy in August to remove the cancer, but following the procedure her health took a turn for the worse as she suffered from a haematoma - a blood clot caused by a ruptured blood vessel inside the breast tissue.

Michelle told The Mirror at the time: ""I was really ill and they had to drain blood from my breast. There was even talk of me needing a blood transfusion, but thankfully I recovered.""

The former actress has since been given the all-clear.

Donald Waugh

From 1978 to 1980, Donald joined Grange Hill as Joseph 'Hughsey' Hughes. However, after he left the show his life spiralled out of control due to a struggle with alcoholism and he ended up homeless and living on the streets.

He claims the experience ""opened his eyes"" and he has spent a lot of time helping the homeless. Speaking about the enterprise Pavement to Catwalk, Donald previously said: ""Working with and being homeless for a period of time has opened my eyes to the potential and talent within this un-tapped society.

""In this, I have learned that the secret to helping yourself is to help others. I still hold this very close to my heart today.""

Lee MacDonald

Lee was just 12 years old when he joined Grange Hill as Zammo Maguire in 1982 and he remained as the character until 1987. Along the way, his role involved some of the heaviest storylines on the show, including heroin addiction.

After leaving the show he then tried to become a professional boxer, but tragically things didn't work out as he was involved in a horrific car accident that saw him thrown through the window screen. Lee had to have 40 stitches in his head and was told by doctors that it could take a year to recover his memory.

But the worst part of it all was that he was banned from boxing for life and understandably he was ""devastated"". Speaking to The Guardian in 2009, he said: ""After the celebrity of being in Grange Hill and the excitement of the boxing, here I was, aged 21, working in a wholesaler.

""I remember thinking, 'I can't box any more, I'm not acting and I'm here putting keys in a bag' and my early 20s were really dark because of that. It took me a bit of time to sort myself out.""

Amanda Mealing

In season two of the show, the character of Tracy Edwards was introduced, played by Amanda Mealing, however, she didn't remain for very long. The 56-year-old actress went on to have longer stints on shows such as Casualty and Holby City.

However, in 2002 when she was 34, she was diagnosed with breast cancer just days after giving birth to her second child. Keen to get better as soon as possible for the sake of her kids, Amanda quickly underwent an urgent mastectomy.

She previously told The Express: ""I didn't wallow in self-pity, the anger I felt made me very proactive. I decided I would do everything I needed to do to fight the cancer and I wouldn't let it take over my life.

""It had taken my health and my time but that was it. In the seven months of chemo, plus three weeks of daily radiotherapy, I tried to live as normally as I could."" Thankfully Amanda was eventually given the all-clear and she has since become an ambassador for Breast Cancer Care.

Clive Owen and Amanda Owen - who rose to fame on Our Yorkshire Farm - announced last year that they had decided to separate, with him having spoken about the split this week

Our Yorkshire Farm 's Clive Owen has been praised after taking some responsibility for the end of his relationship with his estranged wife Amanda Owen.

The farmer, 68, and his estranged wife Amanda, 48 - who rose to fame alongside their family on the Channel 5 series - announced that they were separating last year.

The former couple said at the time that they would co-parent their nine children and were going to continue to work together on Ravenseat Farm in North Yorkshire.

Clive spoke about the end of the relationship whilst on ITV 's Lorraine earlier this week. He told stand-in host Christine Lampard, 44, that he ""a massive part to play"".

He said his family signed up for Our Yorkshire Farm - which ran from 2018 to 2022 - as an ""opportunity."" After describing it as ""successful,"" he added: ""I handled it very badly.""

He continued: ""It was such a change in our lives and I sadly made a right mess of things basically. I had a massive part to play in our relationship ending. A massive part to play.""

""When all this was going on, here I am ranting and raving and drinking and carrying on. I don't know - jealousy,"" he further commented during the recent interview.

Clive suggested that he had felt the project was ""taking [Amanda] away,"" though he added: ""It wasn't. In that she was just doing ... she was committed [to the opportunity].

""But it seemed to eat away at me and I handled it badly and I behaved badly towards her. I should have been supportive and I was doing the absolute opposite.""

After it was stated that Amanda has been trolled on social media, he said: ""I just feel that I can't just sit back and watch all this happen without maybe saying something in her defence.""

The farmer further commented about Amanda: ""She's a remarkable woman. I made a complete mess of it. We got to a point where we couldn't be together anymore.""

Following the interview, viewers have praised Clive for speaking candidly about the relationship. Some took to Twitter earlier this week to share their thoughts on him.

One wrote: ""What an honest and vulnerable interview. Well done Clive for owning the situation and protecting your family."" Another said: ""What a man for being honest"".

""Respect to you Clive for admitting your mistakes and owning them,"" tweeted a third. Another said: ""Well done Clive. Can't have been easy to go on live tv to discuss it.""

A fourth wrote: ""So very refreshing, respect to Mr Owen for attempting to set the record straight"". Another said: ""Aw bless him for his owning up and recognising his faults.""

""I admire you Clive for being a man that actually admits his faults and takes some responsibility! Well done,"" tweeted another viewer following his recent interview.

Similarly, another person wrote on the platform: ""That must have taken a lot to go on national tv and admit his wrong doing. Well done Clive. Thank you for being so honest"".

""Very frank, and admirable,"" said another. Whilst one wrote: ""Such humility and kindness; stepping up to defend [Amanda] even though you dislike media attention Clive.""

Lorraine airs weekdays on ITV and ITVX from 9am.

The farmer and TikTok star, 23, who has proved popular with viewers, was recorded apparently pulling a small bag out of his black satchel, as he danced in a pool, surrounded by other party goers in Croatia.

Will, wearing black swim trunks and sunglasses, proceeds to throw a few dance moves and then stand with a group also in their swimwear, with his back to the camera.

He then starts talking to a fellow party-goer in a pink hat before the 47 second clip ends.

One person at the party told The Sun : ""I recognised Will straight away as I knew him from TikTok.

""He was cutting some shapes and looked like he was having a great time.""

The video was reportedly taken at Noa Beach Club in Croatia, an open air party venue.

The footage comes after Love Island contestant Haris Namani was dumped from the villa by a vote and to add to his woes a video recently emerged of him in a street brawl.

The video shows Haris appear to land a punch on the unnamed man as they face off in the street.

Speaking to ITV2 about the video in an exit interview, Haris said: ""I'm devastated that this video has been seen, it's not a reflection of my character. I'm not someone that goes looking for fights and I didn't want to be in that situation. This was a heat of the moment thing.

""The video doesn't show everything that happened. Afterwards we met up and we cleared the air; we've shaken hands and we get along now. It's not something that would happen again.""

ITV have yet to comment on either the white substance scenes or the Haris brawl video. But a source close to the show says bosses were 'relieved' Haris lost the public vote and has now exited the villa.

Haris was dumped from the villa in South Africa along with Anna- May Robey, after Aussie bombshells Aaron and Jessie had to choose from the least popular islanders.

The Mirror has contacted ITV for comment.

The actress has been invited to be guest editor on the BBC One show, and she opens up about her enduring love of wildlife and the countryside, calling on people not to destroy it

Judi Dench counts champagne and Shakespeare among her passions but it's her devotion to the countryside that fills her with every emotion, from anger to utter joy.

When not dazzling on stage or screen, the Bond star is most likely to be found staring into the sky with binoculars, spotting otters or hugging one of her beloved trees. But such is Dame Judi's love for nature that she is truly devastated if she sees a felled tree or a logging truck.

Her face creasing with anger, the 88-year-old says: ""As a child I used to get irrationally upset to see long lorries with huge trees on. I can't explain that. I still don't like seeing trees being felled."" She also plants a tree for every friend who has died and adds: ""I have a lot of famous people in my garden.""

It was her love of nature - otters and squirrels, to be precise - that first attracted her to her partner of 13 years, former farmer David Mills.It's no surprise, then, that the actress has been invited to be guest editor on BBC One's Countryfile, visiting the Scottish Highlands with presenters including Strictly Come Dancing winner and wildlife cameraman Hamza Yassin.

In the episode to be screened on Sunday she opens up about her enduring love of wildlife and the countryside, and calls on people to protect, not destroy it. Judi tells of her lifelong ambition to see golden eagles in the wild, remembering only one glimpse of a bird of prey in Scotland years ago.

She says: ""We were on a back road, I was driving and I looked up and there was an eagle. I said to my daughter Finty, ""˜You look at the road, I'll look at the eagle'. I was driving, shameful isn't it."" So when Hamza spots two golden eagles, one male and one female, soaring out of the mist, Judi is overwhelmed. Clasping his hand, she says: ""I saw one""¦ two. How breathtaking. I'm overcome. It's an enormous privilege. How often does anybody see that? Not very often.""

It's particularly momentous for Judi, given her struggles with severely deteriorating eyesight, a result of age-related macular degeneration. Speaking at Inveraray Castle, in Argyll, Countryfile regular Charlotte Smith asks her how she stays so positive about losing her sight. The star, a talented watercolour artist who once wanted to be a stage designer, says: ""I have no option, or I'll just fall over. But I've got wonderful people who help me.""

During the programme, Judi decides to give oil painting a go for the first time, with help from Glaswegian artist Gordon Wilson. She tries adding a bright red poppy to his painting but the creative moment takes a comical turn when she scratches her forehead without thinking and ends up with red paint on her face.

Judi names Scotland as her spiritual home, even citing a moment with her late husband Michael Williams where she had ""second sight"". She says: ""We were looking for a certain place and I knew exactly how to find it. I'd never been there, I just knew. Michael, Finty and I used to go camping a lot. He'd scare the wits out of us. Finty and I would get into our sleeping bags, he'd have his quiet vodka and then read us ghost stories, frightened the wits out of us.""

It's an emotional visit for Judi, who feels a great affinity with Scotland after making many films there including Skyfall (2012), Mrs Brown (1997) and Victoria & Abdul (2017). She recounts how filming an emotional scene next to a loch for Victoria & Abdul was actually more of a fight scene against the midges and how a scene with Billy Connolly for Mrs Brown was rudely interrupted by a horse with wind.

She also recalls: ""Albert Finney and I thought we were going to Scotland for two weeks for Skyfall. We got intensely excited. We flew up at 7.30pm and were in Glencoe at 5.30am the next morning... and were back on a plane that evening. It was just a question of standing there with the car and Daniel Craig - just looking - then back into the car. But we did see a bit of Glencoe.""

The countryside has clearly ­always had a huge impact on her family. Reminiscing about her childhood with brothers Jeffrey and Peter, she says: ""We lived in York. We all had bikes, the boys and my Ma and Pa. We used to cycle from York to Castle Howard, which is quite a long way. You'd fortunately turn off just before you'd lose your breath and fall off the bike. We'd swim in the lake, that's where I learnt to swim. It was a huge treat to swim and cycle there. It was like Swallows and Amazons.

""Where we lived was famous for owls. We'd look out of the loo window and see an owl sitting there. They lived in the barn at the end of the garden. My brother Jeff would collect the pellets so we had those all over the house."" Her passion for the countryside has had a huge influence on her grandson, Tik Tok star Sam Williams, who also features in the BBC documentary.

Presenter Adam Henson also meets Judi's partner David, an award-winning farmer who gave up dairying to create the British Wildlife Centre on his Surrey farm. David says: ""I saw Judi visiting the centre with her family and she said ""˜Is there anything we can ever do to help?' So I asked her to open our squirrel enclosure.

""She said yes and the rest is history. She loves the animals, she actually goes in and talks to them. Judi loves the squirrels and otters. She fell in love with them first."" A shared love of the countryside and conservation, as well as the ­beautiful, tree-filled garden in their Surrey home, means the future of the planet is always on their minds. David says: ""Judi knows what's happening to the planet and she's worried about it.""

Judi says: ""I think suddenly now there is an awareness that we need to preserve nature. It's really important that we spread the word. People's attitude towards looking after the country is stronger now and is changing. We're made more aware of what we destroy and what we must preserve. We are now more aware of plastic and what harm it does in the sea. Hopefully, it will become a lotmore focused. Just look at all that we have. We simply cannot destroy it.""

Jeremy Clarkson has revealed he's desperately trying to make a profit out of his Diddly Squat Farm, which features in the Amazon reality series, Clarkson's Farm

Jeremy Clarkson reckons he's having one ""last roll of the dice"" as he tries to make money from his farm, before having to sell it.

The former Top Gear host, 63, bought Diddly Squat Farm in the Cotswolds in 2019 but has struggled to make any profit from it. Explaining his latest scheme to try and turn things around and bring in some much-needed cash, Jeremy shared his struggles in his book, Pigs Might Fly.

Opening up about how he's faring on the farm, he writes: ""It would be easy for me to let the brambles and badgers take over my farmland and to sit back and watch the deer and squirrels eat all the trees in my woods. Which is why this morning, I decided to plant my game covers with mustard. It's my last roll of the dice.""

Admitting the mustard, which deters squirrels and deer, was his 'last hope', he continued: ""My last chance to make something - anything - work,"" before adding ominously: ""And if it doesn't? I don't even want to think about it. It hurts my knees and my outgoings this year are truly terrifying, even for me with four other income streams. So I can't hand it back to nature and I daren't move forwards.""

As a seasoned host of shows including Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? and The Grand Tour, Jeremy has other ventures to keep himself afloat, but it seems even these aren't enough to keep the farm open if it doesn't start generating cash.

He wrote in his Sunday Times column earlier this month: ""I've tried farming conventionally and it didn't work. I've tried diversifying and that hasn't really worked either. And I've tried with sheep and pigs and cows and that has been a bit of a disaster as well. So I arrived at a crossroads and was not sure which way to turn. I could sell the farm, but I like having it and for very good reasons. There are no death duties on farmland, so my children like me having it too.""

Jeremy is tied into running Diddly Squat at least for another year thanks to the work of his land agent ""Cheerful"" Charlie Ireland, he revealed. The presenter's girlfriend also recently hinted there was at least one more series of Clarkson's Fram in the pipeline as she shared a shot of the show's crew talking to her man.

The actress, 51, who has been in a relationship with Jeremy for six years, took to Instagram to share a snap of the crew and Jeremy in deep discussion. She captioned the photo, in which Jeremy's co-star Kaleb Cooper can also be seen: ""Penultimate week #clarksonsfarm #tractor #amazonprime.""

One person asked in the comments section: 'When is season 3 being aired?' with Lisa confirming: ""Once they edit!"" Another fan enquired: ""Hopefully not the penultimate week of the penultimate season,"" to which Lisa replied: ""...nope"". Meanwhile, another viewer quizzed: ""And season 4??"" to which the actress responded with a thumbs-up emoji.

ITV have spent £1.2m renovating the new location in the rural wine valley of Franschhoek and sprawling 17-bed estate, with a swimming pool, a rugby pitch and its own zip line

Love Islanders beware: there will be cheetahs at the new villa.

But as well as a crop of conventionally attractive potential love rats, the new South African chateau the reality show contestants will be moving into is by a rescue centre for cheetahs.

ITV have spent £1.2m renovating the new location in the rural wine valley of Franschhoek, which will be home to singletons looking for love in the first winter edition of the series since 2020.

A Cheetah Outreach project sits nearby, protecting the wild animals native to the area, which roam through the farmlands.

Love Island kicks off on January 16th with new host Maya Jama, who takes over from Laura Whitmore.

The presenter kicked off promotion for the show last night on ITV, riding a pink, velvet bucking bronco and telling viewers: ""It's time to grab love by the horns.""

The new villa is a sprawling 17-bed estate, with a swimming pool, a rugby pitch and its own zip line.

Last week, bosses revealed they were boosting their duty of care measures after complaints about contestants bullying one another during the summer series.

Contestants' families will also pause their social media activity during the series, after trolls bombarded the Islanders' accounts with nasty messages.

The lost tunnels were first discovered by accident in 2005 by local farmer Peter Waddell, who says the elaborate construction reminded him of the catacombs in Rome

Tunnels thought to be dug out hundreds of years ago by medieval monks were discovered by accident, as work began to convert a former cattle shed into a restaurant.

Running for about a mile underneath Park Farm on the banks of the Union Canal, near Linlithgow, in West Lothian, the mysterious underground passages left archaeologists stunned.

They were discovered by accident in 2005 by local farmer Peter Waddell, who told the press at the time that the elaborate construction reminded him of the catacombs in Rome.

Situated about 10 feet below the soil, the ancient tunnels were shored up by hand-cut sandstone blocks that used forgotten medieval-era techniques to create impressive arches right along the system.

Measuring a mere five feet in height with a width of three feet, the network was definitely not for the claustrophobic.

Mr Waddell even suggested that they might have been part of a secret escape route from Linlithgow Palace.

The stone-lined culverts, which were deemed too dangerous and inaccessible to open to the public, were unearthed during works to transform an old cattle shed at Park Farm into what is now the loved Park Bistro restaurant.

Speaking at the time, Mr Waddell explained how he stumbled upon the fascinating find and mentioned that there had long been rumours of secret tunnels in the area.

He said: ""We pulled away the stones and there was this gaping hole beneath. We looked in and there was this perfectly preserved arched stone tunnel running as far as we could see.

""It was quite a shock. I wondered what on earth it was.

""The last time I saw work like that was when I saw the catacombs in Rome.

""The stonework is immaculate and the ceiling uses keyed stones to form an arch, a practice favoured by monks which was lost with the discovery of concrete.""

Comparing the tunnels to the historic passageways found beneath Paisley Abbey, Glasgow University archaeologist and Time Team TV star Dr Tony Pollard said they had most likely been built by monks, who worked the land there in the 1300s.

Dr Pollard commented: ""This is potentially a very important discovery. The one at Paisley had slightly better stonework and ran off a millpond.

""But this one is rougher which would make it older. The construction seems quite elaborate for what is probably a glorified drain, but monks were quite wealthy.""

But while historians in the 2000s seemed fairly confident that the tunnels were of medieval origin, others are not so convinced, suggesting instead that they were nothing more than sturdy drainage ditches, built in the 19th century to serve nearby Kingscavil Quarry.

703,"Scientists urge companies to stick graphic 'cigarette-style' health warnings on meat","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/scientists-urge-companies-stick-graphic-31351093","Scientists urge companies to stick graphic 'cigarette-style' health warnings on meat

Researchers have suggested that graphic warning labels should be added onto meat-based products - they said the alarming stickers should be introduced as national policy

Health warnings similar to cigarette-style stickers could persuade Brits to cut down on meat consumption, according to scientists.

Researchers at Durham University said authorities should consider adding graphic imagery on meat products to help the environment. They suggested the move should be introduced as a national policy.

It comes after a study found that warnings around future pandemics, health concerns, and climate change discouraged people from picking a meat-based meal.

The experts believe that by highlighting the impact that meat farming has on global warming consumers could be more likely to make healthier food choices and take steps to decrease their carbon footprint. According to the Climate Change Committee, which advises the Government, reducing meat and dairy consumption by one-fifth could help the UK meet its environmental commitments.

The study split 1,001 adults who eat meat into four groups and showed them pictures of hot canteen-style meals, which had either a health warning label, a pandemic warning label, a climate warning label or no label at all. One label showed a deforested area, with factory smoke in the distance, and text saying: ""Eating meat contributes to climate change"". Interviewees were then asked several questions about how anxious the warnings made them feel, how believable they were, what they would choose and if they would support these types of labels being implemented as policy.

Psychology PhD student Jack Hughes, who carried out the food label research with supervisors, said: ""Reaching net zero is a priority for the nation and the planet. As warning labels have already been shown to reduce smoking as well as drinking sugary drinks and alcohol, using a warning label on meat-containing products could help us achieve this if introduced as national policy.""

Senior author on the paper Dr Milica Vasiljevic, from Durham University's Department of Psychology, said: ""We already know that eating a lot of meat, especially red and processed meat, is bad for your health and that it contributes to deaths from pollution and climate change. Adding warning labels to meat products could be one way to reduce these risks to health and the environment.""

The experts shared three ways to become a more sustainable meat eater

Cutting down

""If your focus is on sustainability and the environment, less meat is generally always better than sustainable meat,"" explained Ed Steele, co-founder of Hoxton Farms. You can take steps towards eating more plant-based meals - perhaps by doing meat-free Mondays, or only eating meat when you're out.

Eating consciously

Reid stressed how important it is for people to be more responsible in the way they consume meat. ""The best way is to know where your meat comes from. It's not the consumers' fault that the majority can only purchase their meat from supermarkets, which provides a more cost-effective offering to customers. So there's no judgment on the consumer. But the cheaper something is - across the entire food chain - the more corners have been cut. It's never usually good for you.""

He recommends buying from a butchers, and said: ""It could sometimes be cheaper. Or you can also buy great meat online, too. It's not easy to eat consciously, so it is about planning, just like anything in life.""

Choosing wisely

""When choosing animal proteins, eat more chicken, eggs and pork, which are generally more environmentally friendly than dairy, beef, and lamb,"" Steele said - or better yet, swap out ""with other protein sources, like peas and legumes"".

Reid added: ""We need to look beyond beef and the prime cuts such as rump, fillet, sirloin and rib eye. We also have the skirt and shin, great for slow braising,"" he said. Reid grew up in a Caribbean home where he learnt to ""respect the whole animal"". He said: ""We had our own chickens and we ate every bit of it. I think we've lost that bit in society.""

The rare weather phenomenon was spotted in the UK in Scotland on Tuesday by a farmer feeding his sheep, as gusts of snowy wind suddenly whipped up in front of him

This is the moment a rare 'Snownado' was captured on camera by a farmer as Britain braces for blizzards overnight.

Michael Peterson was feeding his sheep in Shetland, Scotland when he saw a 'snow tornado' whip up in front of him on Tuesday.

Scotland has borne the brunt of the coldest weather seen in the country during the freezing Arctic snap so far, with -16C recorded overnight in Altnaharra in the Scottish Highlands.

Michael told BBC Radio Scotland that he saw the mind-boggling icy twister because he was in the ""right place at the right time.""

The World Meteorological Organisation said that snow tornadoes, also known as 'snow devils,' happen when winds pick up particles of snow and create the vortex needed to create the twister.

They said: ""This is a very rare phenomenon that occurs when surface wind shear acts to generate a vortex over snow cover, resulting in a whirling column of snow particles being raised from the ground.""

More bad weather is expected across the country amid amber warnings issued by the Met Office for today and tomorrow.

In England, forecasters warned that ""heavy snow is likely to cause significant disruption"" on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning.

Around 50mph winds and up to 40cm of snow forecast in some areas and there are also amber warnings in North Wales and Northern Ireland, where ""significant disruption"" to transport and power supplies is expected.

Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said that a pocket of western Scotland covering Glasgow and the county of Argyll may be the only region untouched by heavy rain and snow over the next 24 hours.

He said the worst of the weather is expected in north-west Wales and northern England, where ""gusts of easily 50mph"" are on a collision course with ""30 to 40cm of snow"".

Mr Burkill said: ""The combination of heavy snow and gales is why we're likely to see blizzards and drifting snow which causes extra hazards on the roads.

""In places covered by amber warnings, there will be very difficult, treacherous conditions.

""Ideally avoid travelling in those periods - but if you have to head out then be aware that journeys could take significantly longer.""

Pruan Punta, 73, and his wife Saisuda Kwai-aun, 53, both survived a dangerous attack by a frenzied swarm of wild bees, leaving them with stings all over their bodies

A couple miraculously survived an attack by thousands of wild bees that were sent into a frenzy by raging forest fires.

Pruan Punta, 73, and his wife Saisuda Kwai-aun, 53, were sitting under a mango tree in front of their home in northern Tak province, Thailand, when a swarm of about 10,000 angry bees descended upon them.

The insects started divebombing the terrified couple, stinging them all over their bodies.

Pruan jumped into the nearby Ping River to avoid the stings, but his unfortunate wife, who suffered partial paralysis, was unable to escape and had to endure the full force of the bees' attack.

With the crazed swarm still following him, Pruan emerged from the water and ran 500 meters to his neighbor's house, where he called for help.

Rescuers had to wear motorcycle helmets and protective PPE suits left over from the pandemic before bundling the couple into an ambulance. Bizarrely, the bees ignored the rescuers completely and continued assaulting the couple.

The couple was rushed to the nearby Ban Tak Hospital for treatment, where doctors had to remove dozens of stingers embedded painfully in their faces.

Speaking to local media on Thursday, Saisuda said: 'The bees stung me mostly in my face and limbs. It hurt but I couldn't do anything since I couldn't run away.

'I tried to crawl away from the mango tree towards our house.

'The pain was intense. I just remember fainting and I couldn't move.'

The pensioners were discharged from hospital and later returned home, but they are both afraid of the bees returning.

Husband Pruana added: 'I'm thankful to the rescue team for their swift response. My wife could have died if she did not receive treatment in time.""

It is believed the swarm had been driven towards the residential area after recent forest fires burned their natural habitat in northern Thailand.

The fire also destroyed all of the beehives in the area. The massive swarm of wild bees was likely frightened and escaped from the forest, making their way to the residential area, where they attacked the couple.

Fires caused by out-of-control agricultural burning have been raging this week in the Doi Soi Malai National Park on the Thanon Thong Chai mountain range, damaging trees and bushland.

Wildlife rescue worker Apirak Phunuan, who attended the scene, said he believes the change in the climate and the smoke has caused the bees to behave differently.

He said: 'The fires have forced the bees out of their hives in the woods. This kind of incident is very rare. It's not normal for the bees. They became aggressive because of the flames and smoke.'

Many questions remain unanswered over the tragic discovery of a baby girl's body on a beach in Spain, with the child now understood to be even younger than first thought

Mystery continues to surround the shocking discovery of a child's headless body on a Spanish beach.

The remains of the unknown youngster, originally thought to be aged between two and three, were discovered on the beach early Tuesday morning in the Costa Dorada resort of Roda de Bera in the costal province of Tarragona.

A council cleaner alerted his bosses after making the find, who called police. Authorities have made only a few statements regarding their investigation in the days since, leaving concerned local and people across the world wondering exactly what happened to the tragic young girl.

The very first autopsy results are said to point to her being far younger than originally believed, with one main theory now emerging as to how she ended up on the beach.

She is instead thought to have been just six months old - and may have died after going overboard in one of the many fatal migrant boat crossings in the Mediterranean.

Forensic experts have also concluded her body was in the water for between a fortnight and two months. Her body was said to be missing a number of parts along with her head, and is understood to have been found be in an advanced state of decomposition.

Shortly after the find, Civil Guard officers cordoned off the area and moved locals and holidaymakers on to other areas of the sand, before an investigating judge authorised the removal of the body.

Local mayor Pere Virgili said the council worker who found the body had thought at first that he had seen a doll - and authorities believe other walkers may have made the same mistake.

He added that certain signs suggesting she had been washed ashore rather than deposited at the location, such as the fact that she was wearing a ""bodysuit, a kind of tracksuit and a jacket"", rather than beach clothes.

Announcing the discovery, he town hall wrote in a tweet: ""We inform you that this morning the body of a two to three-year-old child was found on the shoreline on the Costa Dorada beach. The area is cordoned off and officials are waiting for the judge to authorise the removal of the body. We ask the public to avoid the area.""

Roda de Bera is a 25-minute drive north of Tarragona, with Barcelona is just over an hour's drive north. It has historically been known for its agriculture, later becoming an important tourist spot on the Costa Dorada coast following the tourism boom in the late 20th century.

The state of the child's body is thought to be adding to difficulties in determining whether she died accidentally or as the result of a crime. It is hoped that further tests will be establish a probable cause of death, and provide authorities with information on her ethnic origin that may help trace her.

A spokesman for the Civil Guard said earlier this week: ""All we can confirm at the moment is that the body of a baby has been found at Roda de Bera beach in the province of Tarragona. The alarm was raised at 8.50am this morning. The matter is still under investigation.""

Flies have been a big issue in recent months for him and his neighbours - but now there are a lot of rats attracted to his flat because of the pigeons who live upstairs

A man is asking for advice about what to do with a neighbour who houses 200 pet pigeons, as they are attracting flies and rats to the property.

In recent months, flies have been a huge issue as they swarm his home, leaving him unable to open his doors at times - but now he's seen evidence of rats as a result of the neighbours' unusual pet.

The man had been moving something outside when he saw two rats run past his feet, leaving him horrified at the 'rotten' situation.

Taking to Reddit, he said his letting agents have investigated and say the pigeons are not attracting the rats, but he feels they must be.

The man, who remained anonymous, wrote: ""The problem is that the house next door which is a rental, they keep a number of pigeons. I was told last year that he had 200.

""I found a rat hole tunnelled into my garden from under one of the lofts. The hole was filled with pigeon feathers and food. I was moving some old outdoor dog beds in my lean-to yesterday and two rats ran out past my feet. I found loads of rat excrement and the stink was rotten.""

He added that he went to his neighbours to talk to them about it but they were not helpful, so he went to his letting agents.

He said: ""They went from 'we will look into it', to 'We investigated this with your neighbours, and they don't have any evidence of any rodents in their garden. We think it could be a local problem, and we feel the neighbours can't be blamed just because they have birds'.

""Now I had a professional pest control guy out last month and he cited the lofts as the overwhelming likely cause of the pests. Never mind the fact the rat hole is literally coming from under the pigeon loft.""

In response, the man received a wealth of advice online with many agreeing it must be an unpleasant situation.

One person wrote: ""Contact Someone in department of agriculture? Anyone keeping birds needs to be registered maybe, for both disease control (bird flu) and animal welfare.""

While another added: ""200 pigeons would also probably put it in the territory of being a business, which again the council would need notification of.""

The mcr-1 gene has built up a resistance to certain life-saving drugs - but there's an easy way to stop it from being transmitted from domesticated animals to humans

Sharing a bed with your dog may improve your sleep quality - but it can negatively impact your overall health. Experts are urging dog owners against regularly sharing a bed with their pets following a spread of an ""untreatable superbug"".

The mcr-1 gene, believed to be transmitted from animals to humans, has built up a resistance to certain life-saving drugs. With drug-resistant infections killing an estimated 700,000 people a year worldwide, the UN warns this could rise to 10 million by 2050 if nothing is done.

Its research team has warned of an instance where humans can pick up the bug, which was first identified in China in 2015. Dogs can harbour mcr-1 in the their gut before it's transported via microscopic feacal particles.

A study at the University of Lisbon found that in two of the households where dogs had tissue infections, the gene was present in the dog and the owner.

Faecal samples were taken from 126 healthy people that were living with 102 cats and dogs in 80 households over a period of two years up to February 2020.

It was found that eight of the dogs and four humans were hosting bacteria including mcr-1.

The results also showed that three of the dogs appeared to be healthy and the others had tissue or urinary tract infections.

The findings were presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Conference.

Experts told attendees that agricultural regions particularly in southern European countries that use colistin will be less likely to contract the mcr-1 gene.

Dr Juliana Menezes, who led the research, said: ""Colistin is used when all other antibiotics have failed, it is a crucial treatment of last resort.

""If bacteria resistant to all drugs acquire this resistance gene, they would become untreatable, and that's a scenario we must avoid at all costs.

""We know that the overuse of antibiotics drives resistance and it is vital that they are used responsibly, not just in medicine but also in veterinary medicine and in farming.""

Rumours of Vladimir Putin suffering a temporary ""nervous breakdown"" came amid speculation he used a body double to represent him while visiting high-ranking Russian generals in Ukraine

Bizarre claims have emerged that Vladimir Putin suffered a temporary ""nervous breakdown"" in recent days after changing to a stronger cancer medicine.

This comes as there is growing speculation that a body double was used to show Kremlin dictator Putin in a high profile visit with generals in occupied Ukraine.

His spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not outright deny the doppelganger today, but referred to the suggestions as ""quite strange"".

Several Russian sources claim that Putin, 70, has changed medicine he is taking for cancer and is in a more serious condition than widely understood.

There is no independent verification for the assertions, but they are being discussed in non-official media outlets.

""He is now undergoing a third course of treatment,"" said political analyst Valery Solovey, a former professor at Moscow's prestigious Institute of International Relations [MGIMO], a training school for spies and diplomats.

""The previous two were extremely unsuccessful.""

Telegram channel General SVR which also regularly claims inside knowledge of Putin's medical condition said Putin is ""most of the time""¦under the control of doctors while trying not to overload himself with state affairs"" despite problems from his war against Ukraine.

On Tuesday night Putin ""probably had a nervous breakdown"".

""At about 21.40, Moscow time, the presidential guards heard strange sounds from the room where the president was.

""Putin did not answer a knock on the door, attempts to determine what was happening in other ways did not bring results.""

After seven minutes his guards who called Putin's duty doctors ""decided to enter the room where the president was.

""Putin sat on the floor near the sofa and wept hysterically.

""He was wearing only a wet white T-shirt, which he had probably tried to take off, and a black sock on his right leg.

""Next to him was a torn diaper, which Putin has been using all the time lately.

""To all appeals to him, the president practically did not react, continuing to sob.""

His medics injected an ""antipsychotic drug"" which led to a rapid improvement.

""The president felt better, he was washed, changed and put to bed.""

The doctors ""cancelled a new drug they had just prescribed for the president"" because of the debilitating ""side effects"" even though it was the basis of his new therapy.

Putin's ""health is deteriorating"" and new treatment is ""impossible to delay"", he said, allegedly referring to the diagnosis of doctors.

Solovey said ""the possibilities of modern medicine allow you to prolong your existence in the form of a zombie for a long time.

""But it is not possible to be a public person.""

It was not Putin seen in the footage from Ukraine's occupied regions of Kherson and Luhansk region, he said.

""It was his double. Everyone knows this,"" he told interviewer Arseny Vesnin on Russian YouTube channel Ischem vykhod.

It is known that carefully edited footage of the ""˜Putin visit' was released at least one day, and perhaps several days, after it took place.

Wagner private army founder Yevgeny Prizoghin had refused to take part in the sham, alleged Solovey.

""He simply knew that this was not the president,"" he said.

""When such things happen, nothing remains of reputation, of political weight.

""The system is still moving by inertia""¦.but in operational and tactical terms, this is the final stage.""

Solovey claimed the inner circle were showing signs of supporting as successor the agriculture minister Dmitry Patrushev, 45, son of Putin's top security aide and leading powerbroker Nikolai Patrushev, 71, a former FSB chief.

Putin is seen as earlier approving such a handover.

However, Putin had failed to make him prime minister, guaranteeing his at least temporary succession if the president resigned or died in office.

""Putin's inner circle is now showing signs of attention to Dmitry Patrushev, trying to make friends with him.

""These are the ten people closest to Putin""¦..

""Putin's closest friends are entirely dependent on him.

""His weakening means the political end and the end of their assets""¦.

""These are the people who do not have their own power resources and never will.""

Now change is likely in Russia with military catastrophe or defeat plus the elites acknowledging that Putin cannot fulfil his public duties.

The elites are sensing defeat and have stopped contacting Putin's secret wife Alina Kabaeva, 39, he claimed.

""Even closest friends have stopped communicating with Alina Kabaeva,"" he said.

""She complained about this to her husband [Putin].

""Her husband said, ""˜You know, I'm not up to it now, there are more important problems'.

""Do you have any idea what this means in the Byzantine world, which is the Russian establishment, if the closest friends stopped communicating with the president's wife, even by phone?""

It was a sign that people are waiting for the end especially given Putin's worsening illness, he said.

Forensic experts say the child was less than six months old when she died - much younger than previously thought - after her body was found in the Costa Dorada resort of Roda de Bera

The child whose headless body was found on a Spanish beach was a baby girl less than six months old, it has emerged.

Initial reports put the youngster's age at between two to three years following the tragic discovery at the beach in the Costa Dorada resort of Roda de Bera on Tuesday.

But the first autopsy results are said to point to her being far younger than previously thought. Forensic experts have also concluded her body was in the water for between a fortnight and two months, according to local reports.

The fact the baby's upper torso was missing along with her head will make it harder to determine whether she died accidentally or as the result of a crime. It is hoped further tests will establish a probable cause of death and determine her ethnic origin.

Roda de Bera mayor Pere Virgili said the child in question could have been on a migrant boat that sank in the Mediterranean.

In a dramatic reference to the large numbers of deaths in the sea in recent times, he said: ""The hypothesis that this baby's body is another one from this 'Mare Mortum' off our beaches is on the table."" He said the baby's clothes, which included a jacket, didn't point to her drowning in a typical beach accident.

Civil Guard officers cordoned off the area after a council cleaner made the grim find on Tuesday morning. Locals and holidaymakers on to other areas of the sand before an investigating judge authorised the removal of the body. A court spokesman confirming the same day that a probe was being led by a judge in the nearby town of El Vendrell.

It subsequently emerged the decomposing body had washed up on the beach the day before it was removed - but had been ignored by passers-by who mistook it for a doll.

A spokesman for the Civil Guard said on Tuesday: ""All we can confirm at the moment is that the body of a baby has been found at Roda de Bera beach in the province of Tarragona. The alarm was raised at 8.50am this morning. The matter is still under investigation.""

Roda de Bera is a 25-minute drive north of the Spanish east coast city of Tarragona. Barcelona is just over an hour's drive north.

The town, well-known thanks to its Roman arch, was mainly dedicated exclusively to agriculture until the second half of the 20th century when it became an important tourist spot on the Costa Dorada.

Statutory sick pay is the basic minimum a worker should receive by law if you can't work due to illness - although many employers pay more than the statutory level

Statutory sick pay is due to rise by 6.7% next year, meaning workers will be entitled to more money if they're unable to work due to illness.

Statutory sick pay is the basic minimum an employee should receive by law if you can't work due to illness. It is currently worth £109.40 per week but will rise to £116.75 in April 2024.

If you're eligible, you can receive statutory sick pay for up to 28 weeks. You can start claiming from the fourth day you are off work sick and it will be paid to you through your normal wages.

Statutory sick pay is subject to tax and National Insurance and if you have more than one job, you may be entitled to sick pay from both employers. Many employers pay more than statutory - so check your contract to see what you should be entitled to.

To be eligible for statutory sick pay, you must:

You need to give your employer a fit note, sometimes known as a sick note, if you're off work for more than seven days in a row, including non-working days. Agency, casual and zero-hours workers are entitled to statutory sick pay if they meet the eligibility criteria.

According to Citizens Advice, you cannot claim statutory sick pay if you:

Are getting Statutory Maternity Pay or Maternity Allowance

If your employer says you cannot claim statutory sick pay, you should ask them for a written explanation of the reason why on a form called SSP1. You should be given the form within seven days of you going off sick.

You may be able to claim Employment and Support Allowance if you're employed but you can't get statutory sick pay. Speak to Citizens Advice or Turn2Us if you're unsure about what help you could be entitled to.

David and Victoria Beckham had reportedly requested to build a brand-new access road between their sprawling £12million Cotswolds mansion and a nearby farm track

David and Victoria Beckham have reportedly pulled the plug on plans to build a new road 'the length of three football pitches' through the Cotswolds countryside. The couple are said to have faced fury from miffed-off neighbours over the request at their £12million home.

Former England striker David, 48, and his fashion designer wife, 49, were hoping to construct a brand-new 250-metre-long road between their massive mansion and a nearby farm track, something residents called 'pointless'. They had already been granted permission to build a new greenhouse, which the road would have been connected to. But, according to planning documents, the pair's plans for the controversial access road have since been 'withdrawn'.

""Further to our recent communication I confirm that the application described above has now been treated as withdrawn,"" a note from senior planner James Nelson dated August 25 reads, per MailOnline.

""Use of existing farm track from C13400 (adjacent to New Gardens Cottage) as temporary construction access track (two years) to serve Maplewood Barn plus formation of approximately 250m of new access track (95m in agricultural land and 155m within residential garden). At: Maplewood Barn Great Tew Chipping Norton Oxfordshire.""

David and Victoria bought the giant home in Great Tew for £6million back in 2016, adding two pools and a tennis court - which was later transformed into a football pitch. Locals didn't like the couple's previous plans but weren't able to stop them. However, it appears the outrage seems to have worked this time as the pair's new road plans, submitted in June, are no more. ""There is already an access road to the property,"" blasted one critic on the planning platform.

""So what is the point of laying another road just to build a fancy greenhouse,"" they asked, branding the entire ordeal a 'pointless and a waste of resources'. According to The Sun, another wrote in the comments: ""I am always amazed at those who come to live in the countryside and then want to bring in suburbia.

""They are not content to live in a natural country environment, they want 'to build a lake', not content with a small lake they then want to enlarge it to some 4 acres with an island so they can have picnics on the island.

""The applicants defended their plans, saying they would recreate a classic English meadow scene, well if that was the case I would change my landscape architect because [famous garden designer] Capability Brown would never have designed a garden, with such features as huge football pitched, a spectator stand, an outdoor pool, and a sauna. Classic English? I don't think so.

""I am surprised they have not applied for a funfair ride to be installed on the remainder of the 2 acres left as garden now that they have enlarged the curtilage of the residential area.""

Scientists have suggested that palm oil could cause a pandemic as deforestation has a part to play in its mass production - they believe it could make the world prone to outbreaks of zoonotic disease

Peanut butter could trigger the next global pandemic after scientists found an alarming connection to zoonotic disease, it has been revealed.

Researchers discovered the mass production of the nutty spread could make the world more open to outbreaks of zoonotic disease, which is an infectious disease that can be transmitted between humans and animals. The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Veterinary Science, highlighted a strong link between pandemics and deforestation - which sees dozens of trees destroyed so the land can be used for other reasons.

This has a devastating impact on animals as they are forced to escape their natural habitat and find a home nearer to human dwellings such as forests or jungles. But in doing so, it can increase the chances of spreading the disease, much like the cross-species jump thought to have sparked the Covid-19 pandemic in a Wuhan market, China, in 2019.

One of the leading causes of deforestation is the obtaining of palm oil found in palm trees. This oil is used to produce a huge number of goods including cosmetics, cleaning products and, yes, peanut butter. In fact, palm oil can be found in approximately 50% of all packaged household products.

The new study, the first to examine the cause-and-effect relationship on a global scale, suggests deforestation due to palm oil plantations increases the likelihood of zoonotic disease transmission because it destroys the habitats of animals such as bats that are known to be carriers of new diseases, reports Daily Star.

What's novel about the findings is the discovery that, counterintuitively, reforestation (meaning an increase in forest cover) may also spark more disease. ""We don't yet know the precise ecological mechanisms at play, but we hypothesise that plantations, such as oil palm, develop at the expense of natural wooded areas, and reforestation is mainly monospecific forest made at the expense of grasslands,"" lead author Serge Morand said.

The planting of the same crop to cover a large area reduces biodiversity and is ultimately unsustainable, despite being perceived as a positive counterweight to deforestation. ""Both land use changes are characterised by loss of biodiversity and these simplified habitats favour animal reservoirs and vectors of diseases,"" Prof Morand explained. The study found a quarter of global forest loss has been due to an increased demand for products like beef and palm oil. Cutting down one hectare of forest for palm oil also emits 174 tonnes of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of a jetliner's carbon output. The authors conclude that rapid deforestation and the increase in palm-oil plantations between 1990 and 2016 are inherently linked to the increasing spread of zoonotic diseases, as well as vector-borne disease spread by insect bites.

Data from 47 countries suggests this connection while reforestation may have been responsible for the loss of animal biodiversity and increased zoonotic disease outbreaks in 27 countries. ""Reforestation can increase biodiversity loss when forest expansion is made at the expense of grasslands, savannas, and open-canopy woodlands,"" the study team writes. Our result shows that oil palm plantations may also constitute a threat to global health by favouring zoonotic and vector-borne diseases."" Now that the relationship between deforestation and disease has been backed up by more data, the researchers warn we must act quickly to prevent another pandemic.

They have proposed three key recommendations for policy-makers:

""We hope that these results will help policymakers recognise that forests contribute to a healthy planet and people, and that governing bodies need to avoid afforestation and agricultural conversion of grasslands,"" Prof Morand said.

Brain health scientist Professor Michael Crawford says 'we are heading for an idiocracy' if the nation doesn't improve their diets, as we're currently deficient of one staple ingredient

Advancements in modern-day living have changed how humans interact, work, and importantly, the type of food put on the table. But what we now eat could be to blame for our declining brain health, according to a leading scientist, with a key ingredient missing from many day-to-day diets.

Professor Michael Crawford, who is Director of the Institute of Brain Chemistry and Human Nutrition, and author of a new book The Shrinking Brain, argues that the size of the human brain has shrunk by an alarming 20 per cent, and as a result, IQ scores have steadily declined while cases of mental illness have increased exponentially.

Currently, one in five of the world's children and adolescents have a mental health condition, according to World Health Organisation statistics. In one study, Norwegian researchers, headed by Ole Rogeberg, a senior research fellow at the Ragnar Frisch Center for Economic Research in Norway, analysed the IQ scores of Norwegian men born between 1962 and 1991 and found that scores steadily decreased among those born after 1975. ""Similar studies in Denmark, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Finland and Estonia have demonstrated a similar downward trend in IQ scores,"" notes Rogeberg.

And it's all down to our diet, he says. ""The decline is due to environmental factors"". Another study in the US showed IQ test scores dropped during a 13-year period. Researchers say the trend coincides with a change in the Western diet away from fat and towards carbohydrates and sugar, based on the mistaken belief that it was fat, not sugar, that was causing heart disease and that we should all eat a low-fat diet. They claim IQ scores have been dropping by about seven per cent per generation.

""We are heading for an idiocracy,"" says Professor Crawford, who is also a visiting professor at Imperial College London. He believes modern-day diets are to blame, saying they are 'dumbing us down'. ""Our genome is adapted to eating the wild foods we ate during our species' evolution.

""Today's diet bears no resemblance to this."" In his book, The Shrinking Brain, he says ""Our ancestors evolved a unique 1,600cc brain evolving from our ancestral 350cc brain of the chimpanzee, despite our genome only differing by 1.5 per cent. This could only have happened with the provision of brain-specific building nutrients from land and sea.

""There is incontrovertible evidence of early Homo sapiens exploiting the marine food web in coastal Africa."" In other words, he says we were waterside apes - a theory championed by David Attenborough - who got smarter and grew bigger brains, by eating mussels, oysters, crabs and fish. The professor discovered in 1971 that the brains of all mammals are rich in omega-3 DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid). The size of their brain varied according to their dietary supply of DHA found in seafood, his study states.

A dolphin, for example, has a 1,700cc brain, slightly larger than ours, while a lion has a 320cc brain about that of a chimpanzee, he notes. ""The mix of wildland and aquatic foods powered by the encephalization of the brain from the 340cc of the chimp to the 1,500-1,700 of cro-magnon. DHA is not only involved in signalling but it stimulates gene expression in the brain so the rich aquatic food sources constantly, every day, would have powered the increase in brain size and function,"" says Crawford.

Patrick Holford, CEO of the FoodfortheBrain.org charity, adds: ""Today's diet contains less than a tenth of the omega-3 fats that our ancestors ate and this is having dire consequences on mental health. Increased rates of depression, autism, ADHD and dementia are all strongly linked to lack of seafood. Increased intake from eating fish or supplementing omega-3 fish oils reduces dementia risk by 20 per cent.

""While a plant-based diet has many benefits, those who eat no fish, are especially vulnerable and must supplement omega-3 DHA, derived from algae. The only way to be sure you have enough is to get a blood test to specifically test your levels."" The charity has launched a simple pin-prick test that can give you a clear indication of your Omega-3 levels, alongside a Cognitive Function Test, that can help identify what's driving future risk and show you how to dementia-proof your diet and lifestyle.

Canadian neuroscientist and brain expert Professor Stephen Cunnane, at the University of Sherbrook in Canada, agrees: ""A shore-based diet, i.e., fish, molluscs, crustaceans, frogs, bird's eggs and aquatic plants, provides the richest known dietary sources of brain selective nutrients. Change in diet away from marine foods is the likely explanation for this decrease in brain size.""

Today, less than five per cent of children achieve the basic requirement for omega-3, according to studies. Professor Crawford, who is also a science advisor to the charity foodforthebrain.org, claims that if a pregnant woman lacks omega-3 DHA, she produces a substitute fat, oleic acid, to fill the baby's brain. However, he says that levels of oleic acid in a pregnant woman's blood predicted preterm birth, which carries the highest risk of developmental brain problems, as well as a risk of learning and cognitive disabilities.

Brain size is worked out from skull capacity. Homo sapiens skulls dating back to 29,000 years ago had a brain capacity of 1,660cc. By 10,000 years ago it was around 1,500cc or 1.5 kilograms. Average brain size today is a fifth smaller, at 1,336cc. Brain size may have started to shrink from 10,000 years ago, coinciding with mankind developing more land-based agriculture and eating less marine food along rivers and coasts, according to reports.

Ellie Goulding and husband Caspar Jopling are reportedly spending time apart. Here, we take a look at Ellie's former flings from popstars to reported royalty

Popstar Ellie Goulding tied the knot to husband Caspar Jopling in a grand fairytale wedding in York Minster that was attended by royalty.

The 2019 ceremony came a year after they announced their engagement following their first encounter at a dinner party.

But the Starry Eyed singer, 36, has admitted it was far from love at first sight and that they shared nothing in common initially.

Speaking on Jessie Ware's Table Manners podcast in 2020, Ellie said: ""We didn't fancy each other at all. We were just sat next to each other at dinner.

""I was feeling really rough. I had terrible bronchitis at the time and I was really ill - the most ill if been in ages. All I wanted to do was go to bed after the show [Jingle Bell Ball] and I went to this dinner that my friend had kindly put on for me.

""And I was sat next to Caspar and he was from a big farming family and I talked about how I was vegan. And he talked about how much he loved meat: beef and chicken and lamb and whatever else. So we literally had nothing in common.""

The couple have managed to keep their relationship extremely private but shared the news of welcoming baby Arther in 2021.

But now it has been reported that their marriage is on the rocks due to their hectic work schedules, although they may come to a co-parenting agreement, according to sources.

Neither Ellie nor Caspar have moved out of their family home and they have continued to enjoy holidays together.

""There is no discussion of a divorce and neither of them have been in a new relationship,"" a source told The Sun, before adding: ""The priority is to keep good friends and remain amicable whilst they work out their next steps, so they can stay close and enjoy being mum and dad to Arthur.

""There will always be a lot of love between them despite some difficult times, and they want the best for each other.""

The source went on to say that away from their time co-parenting Arthur, they are living separate lives.

Before falling for Caspar, Ellie dated a string of celebrities; including Dougie Poynter of McFly fame, Ed Sheeran and even Prince Harry, according to reports.

The star first dated Radio 1 host Greg James, now 37, for 18 months from 2010 until 2012. They reportedly ended things because of their busy schedules, as his radio career was taking off at the time.

A source told The Sun: ""It was just a real struggle for them to be in the same place at the same time.

The source added: ""The split is amicable and they are still friends.""

Ellie then briefly dated Ed Sheeran in 2013, with their romance immortalised in his song Don't.

They were linked together after being spotted holding hands at the MTV VMA Awards.

However Ellie denied the speculation and took to Twitter to state there was nothing going on between them.

In a Tweet written that night, which she later deleted, she wrote: ""I love that holding hands with my friends means we're an item.""

""In that case I am in many relationships. Lover not a hater. #whatthef**k.""

Later in the year, Ed offered a different version of events whilst making an appearance on US radio show Clock 98.9.

He revealed they were more than just good mates at the time, explaining: ""I mean, normal people don't hold hands if they're just friends.""

But this romance shattered when it was claimed she cheated on him with One Direction star Niall Horan - which she has denied.

Ed sang: ""And I never saw him as a threat, until you disappeared with him to have sex.""

The following year, she released On My Mind, which many fans argue was a response to Don't, which she has also denied.

The lyrics say: ""You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth"" and ""You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos.""

When it comes to her relationship with Niall, it was nothing more than a few dates, she says.

Ellie told Sevnteen: ""We went on a few dates, and it was really fun. He's a really, really lovely guy.

""He's got the biggest sense of humour, he's very caring, and I see him as a genuine friend in the industry.""

The star then partnered up with fellow popstar Dougie Poynter, from McFly, a year later.

Although as the pair of them lead hectic work schedules in the music world, they called time on their romance in 2016.

Ellie was busy touring the world with her latest tunes while Dougie had moved to acting, trying to crack America at the time.

A source at the time said: ""They are finding it hard to spend time together as Ellie's music career takes her all over the world and she is pulled in different directions.

""Dougie is trying to make it in America as an actor and they are drifting apart.""

And before she met her now husband, Ellie is rumoured to have dated Prince Harry after they were spotted cosying up at the Audi Polo Challenge in May 2016.

This was after they met at Prince William's wedding in 2011 and reportedly exchanged flirty texts.

A source told The Sun at the time: ""He has told friends how much he likes Ellie and she is clearly taken by him.""

One of the rarest gear items in Diablo 4 that's exclusive to the Druid is strong but tough to get

Prepare to grind in Diablo 4 for this precious resource, useful for augmenting the kills of your Druid build.

Regardless of the character class you opt to play as, Diablo 4 has an uncanny ability to make the hours just melt away. Whether it's defeating specific enemies to farm Crushed Beast Bones needed to improve your health potion or not-so random World Boss events primed to test your party's power, Activision Blizzard's latest isn't short on ways to absorb your precious time. This appears doubly so for Druid players, however, where one particular Unique item proves tough to track down.

Unique items refer to pieces of gear that can only be equipped by one particular class. Diablo players have quickly discovered that a Unique Helm called Tempest Roar, exclusive to the Druid, is one of the toughest to find in the game. The Tempest Roar is so sought-after due to its ability to modify the Druid's skill types much more effectively than most others, which likely explains its elusiveness.

If you're playing Diablo 4 as a Druid and want to entertain the idea of acquiring the Tempest Roar Unique Helm, regardless of how long that might take, there's a few key details you should be aware of.

Diablo 4 Tempest Roar: how to get it

Unique level gear has a very low drop rate compared to other rarity tiers anyway, but the Tempest Roar is known in-game as an Ancestral Unique Helm, which means that it is the absolute rarest available for the character class. Typically, our advice would be to farm endgame content like World Bosses and Helltide Events in the hope that the Tempest Roar might drop, but you could be at it for hours with nothing to show.

Your best chance at having the Tempest Roar drop is to squire what's called a Nightmare Sigil, attainable after you've beat the campaign and can enter World Tier 3, and then activating it to up the difficulty of dungeons to Nightmare. Once you enter and complete a Diablo 4 Nightmare Dungeon, there's a far greater chance that Unique gear items like the Tempest Roar will drop. Again, unfortunately it's not guaranteed that it ever will, but at least you'll get some good gear in the process of trying.

Diablo 4 Tempest Roar: what it does

If you're still left wondering whether the Tempest Roar Unique Helm is worth it for your Druid, we've saved you the trouble of finding out what it does. Primarily it's aimed at Druid Builds focussed on Storm and Werewolf abilities. Here's the full breakdown of the item's modifiers:

Tempest Roar Affixes:

Tempest Roar Unique Effect:

As you can see, the Tempest Roar is named as such for how well it synergies both he Druid's Werewolf and Storm abilities. The Druid Lightning Storm build is one of the best in the game, as mentioned in our list, and the Tempest Roar Ancestral Unique Helm would no doubt help you take this to the next level.

Dean Brown was carrying out an inspection at a home in Echo Farms, North Carolina, when he went to check out the attic and noticed a large alligator sitting beside an air conditioning unit

A home inspection took an interesting turn when the enforcement official found a huge 8-foot alligator in the attic of the home.

Dean Brown was carrying out an inspection at a 3-story, new construction home in Echo Farms, North Carolina, when he went to check out the attic and noticed a large figure beside an air conditioning unit.

Speaking to FOX 35, he said: ""I thought it was a stuffed animal that someone threw up there as a joke"".

""So I just went about my inspection.""

However, he soon noticed the ""stuffed animal"" was breathing.

Mr Brown said he had been about 2 feet away from stepping on the head of an 8-foot alligator.

The alligator appeared to be sleeping, Mr Brown said, until he shined a flashlight in its face.

The animal's eyes opened, prompting the inspector to warn the construction crew who were working, to get out of the house.

However, they didn't take him seriously, Mr Brown claimed.

""They laughed at me! They thought I was crazy!""

But after seeing the alligator for themselves, the crew swiftly changed their minds, calling 911 for emergency help which led to animal control officers arriving to capture the gator.

Mr Brown said he had been working in the business since 1995 and had encountered many crazy situations, but this was a first.

There were wetlands located behind the home and that it was thought a door might have been left open allowing the alligator to get inside, Mr Brown said.

However, it was still a mystery as to how it got into the attic.

The young cows were 'mutilated' by intruders at the petting zoo in Stafford overnight, where a farmer described a scene of 'carnage' and said they believed a gang was responsible

A farmer has spoken of their horror after three calves were slaughtered by intruders at their petting zoo.

The baby cows were killed by a suspected gang at their home at Amerton Farm - where managing director Eunice Finney described a scene of ""carnage"". She said the animals had been ""mutilated"" overnight.

The horrific incident is believed to have happened between 5.30pm on Monday, November 6, and 7am, Tuesday, November 7. The alarm was first raised when blood was found, along with signs of forced entry at the gate.

While the carcasses had been removed, parts of the calves' bodies and blood had been left at the farm in Stowe-by Chartley, Stafford. Eunice told Stoke on Trent Live: ""Somebody has broken into our field and killed three calves. They were part of the farm, and they weren't very old. They were Hereford cross cows. They were fine on that night but then we found the carnage. They were mutilated. It has to be a gang that did it because they didn't know anything about animals to have done it like that. I'm distraught.""

A police investigation is now underway, with officers visiting the site on Wednesday for a forensic examination of the area. It follows a similar incident in the area last month, where a cow was killed on a farm a mile away in the village Grindley. Police said the owner found the cow at the scene at 5.05pm on Wednesday 18 October, and that parts of the animal had been ""harvested for meat"".

Following the latest incident, Stafford Borough Inspector, Rebecca Evans, said: ""Officers remain in the area today and are continuing to progress lines of enquiry at pace and speak to those who might have information around potential suspects. Rural crime can have a profound impact on local people, businesses and communities. We are committed to acting on their concerns, policing rural areas as proactively as possible and finding new ways to support the needs and priorities of our communities.""

The PS Plus Essential games for November are going to be revealed on Wednesday, here's the exact time we'll find out what's coming to the subscription.

The PS Plus Essential games for November 2023 are about to be revealed this week. Here's what we think could appear, and when we'll find out the confirmed game lineup.

UPDATE: The PS Plus Essential November 2023 games have now been confirmed.

PS Plus Essential subscribers had a bit of a spooky month during the PS Plus Essential October 2023 lineup, with the addition of The Callisto Protocol, Weird West, and Farming Simulator 22. Now it's time to head out of spooky season and into pre-Christmas. After a delay last week, we're going to find out what games will be kicking off November's PS Plus offering.

In terms of our predictions, we're looking at the PS Plus Essential November 2022 lineup last year, which featured Nioh 2, Lego Harry Potter Collection, and Heavenly Bodies. Considering Nioh 2 was developed by Team Ninja and released in 2020; perhaps Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection, which was developed by Team Ninja and released in 2021 could be a shout for this month's offering. Plus, there are always more Lego games to go around, perhaps Lego Marvel Superheroes 2, or Lego City Undercover, both of which launched on PlayStation in 2017 (a year after the Harry Potter collection).

As for a third game, it's hard to predict but considering there's usually an indie included, we're going to throw out a wildcard and say The Binding of Issac: Repentance will finish off the trio. Regardless, we're sure the lineup will somehow be leaked ahead of time.

PS Plus Essential November 2023 reveal time

The PS Plus Essential titles for each month are typically revealed on the final Wednesday of the month prior over on the PlayStation Blog. However, this month is a little different. Because November 7 is the first Tuesday of the month, the PS Plus Essential November 2023 free games will be announced on, Wednesday, November 1 at 4.30pm GMT / 12:30pm EDT / 9:30am PDT.

PS Plus Essential games subsequently become available on the first Tuesday of every month, which means they'll be available to download on Tuesday, November 7 at 10am GMT / 5am EST / 2am PST.

PS Plus Essential games are only available until the following month's lineup drops, so you'll have until Tuesday, December 5 to redeem them. On that note, if you've yet to add the PS Plus Essential October 2023 games to your library, make sure you do so before Tuesday, November 7. You don't need to download them to your console either; just add them to your library and you can download them whenever you like, so long as your PS Plus subscription is active.

The Mirror's Ariane visited Jeremy Clarkson's Diddly Squat Farm Shop to buy supplies for a fry-up breakfast. It cost more than double than a normal supermarket, but she was impressed by one item in particular

Thousands of people have been flocking to Jeremy Clarkson's Diddly Squat Farm Shop after it reopened in early February.

Following the success of The Grand Tour presenter's Amazon Prime series Clarkson's Farm, people from all over the country have been swarming to pay a visit to the shop on the edge of his 1,000 acre property.

The Farm Shop itself is tiny, and sells items produced at the farm as well as at nearby places in the Cotswolds - but it's notoriously pricey.

It's estimated that the prices there are 200% more expensive than the nearest supermarket Aldi, according to the Evesham Journal.

I wondered if the expensive price tag was reflected in the taste of the products, so I decided to travel to his Cotswolds farm to buy the items I needed for a fry-up breakfast.

I joined the back of the queue at 10.30am on a Thursday morning, and it took an hour to get to the front.

Finally inside, I picked up some bacon, sausages, eggs and a loaf of bread and before I paid I had no idea what the total would be as some of the costs weren't displayed.

I could only see the price of the bacon and sausage on the shelf, so had to ask about the bread and eggs. It was surprising that the shop didn't have its prices clearly listed, and is something to consider if you're planning a visit. After finally figuring out what each item would set me back, I paid a total of £17.25.

Here is the price breakdown:

According to research company Kantar, picking up all the supplies for a fried breakfast costs on average £6.83. This means picking up the items from the Farm Shop cost 152% more than at a supermarket, and that's without the baked beans.

Back at home, it was time to cook the breakfast and test out the products themselves. It's worth noting that this isn't your average supermarket run for necessities, and many people don't mind paying extra if it's reflected in the quality of the produce, if finances allow for it.

With that said, a full fry-up normally includes other items like tomatoes, mushrooms and baked beans, but these are the only goods I could find in the shop.

While cooking the sausages, I realised that not as much fat and water came out as usual, which is a good sign in my book as it suggests the meat is good quality.

I then completed my breakfast plate by adding a fried egg and toasted sourdough - and it was finally time to taste.

After tucking into all the produce, there was no doubt one winner that stood out from the rest - the eggs.

They were deliciously rich and creamy, and although significantly tiny, I don't think they are comparable in terms of price to regular free range eggs in supermarkets.

Costing £3.20, they are a lot more expensive than a six-pack of medium free range eggs at Aldi (£1.29), but you can taste a big difference.

Cacklebean eggs come from a rare breed of Arlington chickens and have a vivid orange yolk. You can definitely pick them up cheaper elsewhere, but you probably won't find them in your local, big chain supermarket.

In terms of bacon, which cost £4.30 for six slices, I would have expected a bit more meat for the price. In Aldi you can pick up 10 slices of unsmoked back bacon for £1.75.

While there's no doubting the flavour, there was quite a bit of fat on the side that I cut off while eating, so I felt like quite a lot of the product was wasted.

The sausages are definitely different to ones you can pick up in the shop, because they are flavoured with Clarkson's own Hawkstone lager, which has a growing fanbase.

While this might be to some people's taste, personally I don't think it added a particularly strong or enjoyable flavour to go together with a fry-up.

With a £3.80 price tag for six sausages, I would expect them to be bursting with flavour. That being said, they might be better for use in a sandwich with some ketchup or brown sauce because. I could tell they were good quality - and they were very filling.

The most expensive item was the sourdough loaf, which you could normally get for under £2 at a local supermarket.

The large loaf is made a bakery in Lechlade, a town at the southern edge of the Cotswolds. It tasted great, but I personally think that's too much to pay for a loaf of bread.

In terms of the whole meal, one of the things I noticed was how filling it all is. I couldn't finish it all, and I didn't eat lunch that day.

There's no doubt that you're paying for the quality of the locally grown food that fills you up, and it's also great to support hard-working farmers.

However, this isn't something that most people could afford to buy regularly - particularly not now, during the cost of living crisis.

Also, with the queue to the farm shop more than tripling within the hour it took me to get to the front, I don't think it's feasible for a regular visit.

However, if I was nearby and there was no queue, I would definitely return to buy some of those delicious eggs - they were undoubtedly the star of the show.

Colombian-born Katherine Paola Santos is being quizzed by police as it emerged UK intelligence services are assisting in the hunt for the 78-year-old who was abducted by more than 15 armed gangsters

The girlfriend of British millionaire Colin Armstrong, 78, who has been kidnapped in Ecuador, has been questioned by detectives.

The UK intelligence services are said to be assisting in the hunt for Mr Armstrong, who was abducted by more than 15 armed gangsters. He was taken from his ranch early on Saturday along with his partner, Katherine Paola Santos. She is believed to have been rescued in a secret -operation and quizzed after her release. Video footage of Mr Armstrong has emerged which appears to show him partying with Ms Santos and her friends on a boat. He is seen accompanying her on several occasions, including for her 30th birthday party, while in fancy dress as a pilot.

Cesar Zapata, who was appointed as general commander of the National Police force earlier this year by former President -Guillermo Lasso, has reportedly taken personal charge of the probe along with a specialist anti-kidnap and extortion unit called UNASE. Immediately after the kidnapping, the force said: ""Following an apparent criminal act against a businessman in the early hours of this morning in Los Rios, specialist police units are carrying out -operative and investigative work on the ground."" No update has been given since.

Ecuadorian lawyer and former MP Ricardo Vanegas has said in a tweet: ""It's become known -Katherine Paola Santos was born in the Colombian city of -Barranquilla and began having surgery to look more feminine
and her birth name is Alberto Santos. It appears she is now being investigated by prosecutors and police in Ecuador over the kidnap.""

He could not be reached to elaborate on his claims. His son, also called Ricardo, told reporters he was busy teaching at a local university. He said: ""You'll have to speak to my father, but here in Ecuador, the initial stages of an investigation are always conducted in secret. It may be he has received leaked information from sources."" Mr Armstrong was the former UK honorary consul in the city of Guayaquil until his son Nick took over in 2016. As well as founding and owning a large agricultural supply company in the South American country, he is a director along with his son of the 500-acre Tupgill Park Estate near Leyburn in North Yorkshire, which has been the family home for more than 45 years.

The kidnap took place around 2.45am on Saturday at his ranch, called Rancho Rodeo Grande, near the town of Baba in Los Rios -province, a two-hour drive north of Guayaquil. Mr Colin, as he was known affectionately by staff at the ranch, is understood to have been forcibly bundled into a black BMW he owned, which was found -abandoned near the scene. No official comment has been given about video footage that has emerged on social media purporting to show Ms Santos having an -explosives vest removed by police experts on Saturday afternoon at a property on a private gated estate in Samborondon near Guayaquil, which is said to belong to a relative of Mr Armstrong.

The town is the same locality where ex-MP Mr Vanegas's office is based. It is understood Mr Armstrong's son has flown to Ecuador to help police locate his father. Mr Armstrong's daughter Diana Armstrong-Bruns, an estate agent based in California, said: ""This is a critical time. We've been told not to say anything to anyone. We just want my father back."" No ransom demand has yet been made.

The millionaire, thought to have previously been married to an Ecuadorian woman, has long been associated with the South American country. He founded Agripac in 1972. He and Ms Santos were pictured enjoying a jet-set lifestyle together before their kidnapping. The images, posted as a montage by a local news organisation on TikTok, showed them on board a cruise ship and beneath the -Hollywood sign in Los Angeles, California. There are also images of the smiling couple riding on horseback and posing in front of the -pyramids in Egypt.

The businessman's adopted son Leo Morris, 47, helps run a -restaurant at the family's Yorkshire estate. The estate welcomes more than 150,000 visitors a year to an attraction known as the Forgotten Corner, which was initially built as a private folly. A spokesman for the Tupgill Park Estate said yesterday that ""everything is being done"" to ensure his safe release. And added: ""Tupgill Park Estate wishes to express their sincere devastation at the situation and that all of our thoughts and prayers are with the Armstrong family."" Mr Armstrong was awarded an OBE and CMG by the Queen in 2011. Footage that is claimed to show the aftermath of the kidnap was posted online shortly after it happened.

A woman thought to be a member of staff took close-up shots of broken plates on the floor and a man who appeared to be holding a bandage to his head. She then walked into one of the bedrooms where there was blood over the bed and said as she focused in on the stained sheets: ""This is where they hit him. My God, what is this!"" The woman appeared to be referring to the man she had filmed sitting on the stairs nursing what looked to be a head wound. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office confirmed: ""We are in contact with -Ecuadorian authorities following the disappearance of a British man and are supporting his family.""

Yesterday, local media questioned why police had failed to provide any updates after only speaking out on Monday to rule out Mr Armstrong's death amid rumours he had been killed. National newspaper Expreso quoted a member of the Police Communication Department of Zone 8 saying: ""The units continue -investigating, I reiterate when there are results, we will announce them on our official networks.""

The newspaper provided more detail about the abduction, saying the businessman was taken in ""a high-end black vehicle with -diplomatic licence plate"". The police reportedly managed to activate the car's satellite tracking device, which resulted in it being found. According to local reports, the men who took Mr Armstrong were ""hooded individuals dressed in clothing similar to that of the National Police"".

Neighbour Luis Carpio said the farm was fitted with a powerful alarm that, when triggered, could be heard from afar. However, he said the alarm had not been activated. Of the kidnappers, Mr Carpio said: ""I hope God touches the hearts of those people so that they release him soon and we have him back.""

Mr Armstrong's extended family admit they are ""in the dark"" as to why he was abducted. Adopted son Leo was yesterday running the family business in the Dales as his relatives continued to attempt to secure his release. His uncle said: ""Leo is busy at the estate. We only know what has been reported. No more than that.""

723,"Aspartame cancer risk: What food it is found in and how much is bad for you","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/aspartame-cancer-risk-what-food-30464149","Aspartame cancer risk: What food it is found in and how much is bad for you

Despite an offshoot of the World Health Organization saying there is a 'possible' link between aspartame and cancer, the recommended daily limit remains unchanged

An artificial sweetener used in thousands of products including diet fizzy drinks, ice cream and chewing gum has been ruled a ""possible"" cause of cancer by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

In a report released late on Thursday, a WHO body classified aspartame as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"", but it still ruled as safe to drink.

Aspartame is found in popular drinks like Diet Coke, Muller Light yoghurts, Wrigley's Extra chewing gum and many more. So how concerned should you be?

What is Aspartame and does it cause cancer?

Aspartame is an artificial, low-calorie sweetener used as a sugar substitute in various food and beverage products. Aspartame is made up of two amino acids: aspartic acid and phenylalanine. It is about 200 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar) and provides a similar taste without the same caloric content.

Aspartame is authorised as a food additive in Europe and the US and is used in numerous foods, drinks such as Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Diet Snapple, Fanta Zero, Sprite Zero, Crystal Light and Wyler's Light; desserts, sugar free chewing gum including Trident, Extra, Wrigley's and Mentos gum; gelatin-based products, including sugar-free Jell-O and Royal Gelatin; syrups, including Mrs. Butterworth's Sugar Free Syrup and Log Cabin Sugar Free Syrup; medications including cough drops and foods intended to help with weight loss.

It is also in tabletop sweeteners sold as Equal, Sugar Twin and NutraSweet.

An offshoot of the WHO - the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) - has categories for substances based on their risk of causing cancer, based in the strength of evidence.

In 2023, for the first time, WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) announced that aspartame should be categorised as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"" due to a potential link to liver cancer. But it is in the lowest category - reflecting the weak evidence link.

The IACR's decision on aspartame was based on three studies in humans that found a link between the consumption of artificially sweetened beverages and hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of liver cancer.

How is it ""possibly"" linked to cancer but still safe to drink?

The seemingly conflicting statements from the WHO ""” that aspartame may possibly cause cancer but is safe to consume ""” came from two separate groups within the organisation.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), said aspartame is a ""possible carcinogen"". The Joint Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), who review the evidence, maintained its advice that it remains safe to consume within current recommended daily limits.

Dr Mary Schubauer-Berigan, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, said the ""evidence was not of sufficiently high quality or convincing enough"" and ""this is really more a call to the research community"" to study the sweetener more.

The American Cancer Society said they hope people use the latest evidence as an opportunity to ""reflect"" on their use of aspartame, but also an opportunity to review their overall dietary intake, including processed meat and alcohol, known carcinogens associated with increased risk of cancer.

Experts have said the current 'limit' of aspartame is high, and therefore would be difficult to exceed.

How much is safe to drink?

The Food and Agricultural Organisation's Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, who carried out a complementary study, retained its advice that it is safe for a person to drink 0-40mg per kilogram of body weight each day.

The WHO said a person weighing 70kg would need to consume more than between nine and 14 cans of diet soft drink per day to exceed the daily guideline.

Since each type has varying levels of sweetness, the FDA has done the maths (PDF) for you: Consume no more than 75 packets a day of Equal or NutraSweet (aspartame); 23 packets a day of Splenda (sucralose), Sweet One (acesulfame potassium) or Newtame (neotame); and 45 packets a day of Sweet'N Low or Sweet Twin (saccharin).

The different types of carcinogen

Aspartame does have some known health concerns for certain people, the FDA noted. The sweetener should not be used by anyone with the genetic disorder phenylketonuria, certain rare liver disorders or pregnant people with high levels of phenylalanine in their blood, because it doesn't metabolise properly in those individuals.

Dr Francesco Branca, the director of the WHO's Department of Nutrition and Food Safety said if people are unsure whether they're consuming too much aspartame, there's always an alternative.

""If consumers are faced with the decision of whether to take cola with sweeteners or one with sugar,"" he said, ""I think there should be a third option considered, which is to drink water instead.""

Dr Branca added: ""Cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally. Every year, one in six people die from cancer. Science is continuously expanding to assess the possible initiating or facilitating factors of cancer, in the hope of reducing these numbers and the human toll.

""The assessments of aspartame have indicated that, while safety is not a major concern at the doses which are commonly used, potential effects have been described that need to be investigated by more and better studies.

""We're not advising consumers to stop consuming (aspartame) altogether. We're just advising a bit of moderation.""

As popular reality TV show Big Brother appears back on our screens, we remember the tragic deaths of the show's former stars who are sadly no longer with us today

It's been five years since iconic reality TV show Big Brother was on our screens and on Sunday it finally returns, airing nightly on ITVX. The latest UK series will run for six weeks and has new hosts, a fresh logo and an exciting line-up, with its commissioning editor Peter Tierney promising to make ""'reality' real again"".

While many former contestants have gone on to become household names, with the likes of Alison Hammond, Josie Gibson and Brian Dowling, others have sadly been met by tragedy. Many memorable faces have passed away since their time on the reality series, including Jade Goody and Nikki Grahame.

Jade Goody

Jade Goody starred on the 2002 series of Big Brother UK and her fame grew to levels rarely seen before, with her own programme and regular TV appearances. Jade dated former footballer Jeff Brazier and became parents to Bobby and Freddie, but they split while she was pregnant.

She re-entered the Big Brother house in 2007, but was accused of racially bullying co star Shilpa Shetty, sparking outrage and destroying her public image. Jade apologised and tried to redeem herself in India's Big Brother equivalent, Big Boss, where she was shockingly informed on-camera that she had cervical cancer, though the scene was not aired.

In February 2009, just one month before she died, Jade married Jack Tweed in a ceremony she said was ""the happiest day of her life"". She died at her home aged just 27, her loved ones beside her, and hundreds of mourners paid tribute outside her funeral. Jade left an incredible legacy as she sparked a huge drive in cervical screenings which saved countless lives.

Nikki Grahame

One of the best-loved Big Brother UK stars of all time, Nikki won the nation's hearts in 2006 with catchphrases including ""who is she!?"" and her impassioned rants. Following her appearance on the show, Nikki briefly dated her co-star Pete Bennett, as well as starring in her own reality series, Princess Nikki. She won a National Television Award for 'Most Popular TV contender' and released two books, Dying to Be Thin and Fragile, which both covered her experience with anorexia.

Nikki's loved ones set up a fundraiser for her in March 2021 after she relapsed with her eating disorder when the gyms closed, begging for donations for her to receive professional help. She was put into hospital care for the 11th time, but died in her home the day after being discharged in April, aged just 38. Her devastated Big Brother co-stars paid tribute to her, including Pete who broke down in tears as he recorded a video on Instagram. ""I thought we could save her,"" he wept. ""But it's okay, she's in a good place and she's not suffering any more.""

Cassandra Waldon

Big Brother US contestant Cassandra Waldon was the first to walk into the house back in July 2000, in the first ever series of the show when it aired on US channel CBS. She finished sixth and was the first to be eliminated, later returning as part of a twist in the game. Sadly September 2019, Cassandra died after reportedly sustaining a head injury in a car accident while in Rome, Italy.

Cassandra, was living and working in Italy as the communications director for the International Fund for Agricultural Development, a United Nations agency. She was remembered by Big Brother host Julie Chen Moonves on Instagram, who said: ""Rest In Peace Cassandra."" On the same day she passed away, Jackson Michie won the 21st series of US Big Brother.

Miriam Rivera

Big Brother Australia contestant Miriam Rivera became a sought after talent following the 2004 series. Sadly the 38-year-old died in February 2019, after the transgender model was found dead in ""mysterious circumstances"" in her native country, Mexico. Miriam, who rose to fame on reality show There's Something About Miriam, was cremated and there was no opportunity to perform an autopsy, it was reported.

Some months after her death, her widowed husband, Daniel Cuervo, spoke out and said her death had been ""made to look like suicide"". He told Daily Mail Australia that he believed Miriam may have been killed ""for speaking out against human trafficking"". A close friend of Miriam has said that they were ""looking forward"" to the future and she was in shock at her sudden death.

Gordon Sloan

Gordon Sloan was a housemate on Big Brother Australia's first season in 2001, and sadly died eight years later in a Chinese hospital under mysterious circumstances. The 34-year-old had been travelling and working as a charity volunteer at the time of his death. A friend of the reality star, Donna Mulhearn, described him as a 'hero' and told an Australian news agency: ""I was absolutely shocked to hear about his death but not surprised it was overseas while he was travelling. I read the email from his mate and was stunned.""

Sophia Brown

Sophia Brown starred in the tenth series of Big Brother UK in 2009. The bank assistant, from London, was voted into the Big Brother house on day four and was evicted five days later, following a huge argument with housemate Saffia. In May 2012, it was reported Sophia had sadly died at the age of 30.

Sophie Reade, who won the series, shared a tribute on Twitter: ""RIP to Sophia Brown who was also on my series of Big Brother. Such sad news. My thoughts are with her family and friends."" Big Brother narrator Marcus Bentley also added: ""Such very sad news about BB 10 housemate Sophia Brown - God bless Sophia."" She is believed to have suffered from lupus, although her cause of death is unknown.

Kent Blackwelder

Kent Blackwelder appeared on the second series of Big Brother US in 2001, and became known for forming a close friendship with gay housemate Bunky Miller, after admitting he was homophobic. Kent was evicted during the fifth week. In 2017, it was reported that Kent had passed away at the age of 62 due to a heart attack.

Bunky wrote a heartfelt post on social media, which has since been deleted about their positive experiences together and said that he ""never dreamed"" the last time he saw his friend would be their final interaction. Kent's daughter, Maddy Blackwelder said her father had a ""heart of gold"" and wrote: ""I will love you and miss you forever daddio.""

Treetops, which offers support and counselling for children and young people who are experiencing traumatic bereavement, will be focus of Children in Need show

Sitting in the playroom of his house, ten-year-old Harvey was watching morning TV when his parents came in.

The next words they uttered shattered his young life and became what he now sees as the day his childhood ended. ""Your older brother's been killed, been murdered,"" they told him that terrible Father's Day in 2015. I immediately didn't believe it,"" Harvey, now 19 and a farmer based in Derbyshire, says.

""I remember sitting next to a police officer, asking why us? What did we do to deserve that?"" His older brother Edward had tragically died in a house fire that was started deliberately by someone unknown to the family. ""His death left me confused, devastated and angry,"" says Harvey, who has been supported by Treetops Hospice, which is to be featured in tonight's DIY SOS Children In Need special.

""I struggled at school with concentration as all I could think about was how angry I was at the world,"" he adds. ""Anything I could be angry at I was, I think I was this way as I couldn't allow myself to be sad."" Just four years later, while coping with this immeasurable grief he also lost his best friend Billy aged 21 to cancer which was a lot for the youngster to cope with.

""His death made me feel a sadness I could never explain yet he helped me realise that you can't be angry at the world, the whole time he was dealing with cancer he never frowned he only smiled,"" he explains. Treetops, which is located in Risley, Derbyshire, offers support and counselling for children and young people who are experiencing traumatic bereavement.

Harvey credits the service with saving his life - although at first he did not want to attend the grief counselling. ""I went on and off to Treetops for a few years and it did take a lot of persuading for me to stick with it. I didn't want help, I wanted to stay angry as I didn't know how to be anything else.

Counselling allowed me to have something for a long time I thought I'd never have again - a smile,"" he says. ""It saved my life."" On the show, Nick Knowles and his team, alongside BBC Radio 2 presenters including Zoe Ball, Jeremy Vine and Scott Mills, help build Treetops a new haven to support kids at difficult times in their lives.

""Treetops did deliver this support in one of their current buildings, but it wasn't quite fit for purpose and a little bit too clinical for children,"" says Nick. ""So we've created something that will be a welcoming place where they will be able to come and feel comfortable and at ease, and in turn Treetops can continue to support children for many more years to come.""

And Scott says: ""It's great to get everyone together, and use the power of the radio to help get these builds over the line. The Radio 2 listeners are incredible at coming together, and they did not let us down with this one. People from all across the UK helped us find volunteers and materials to help make this build an incredible place for Treetops Hospice.""

The results have left the Harvey delighted. ""The new building is just amazing,"" he says. ""It's hard to put into words my thanks to everyone involved, it will allow young people to go on and pursue their dreams, as without Treetops I would have never been able to follow and achieve mine."" Harvey became a farmer because he was inspired by his brother Edward's love for the outdoors.

""I wanted to be like him,"" he says. ""We used to stay at our great uncle's farm in Dorset and it was something out of all of my siblings, only something me and him did so it was our thing. That made me want to pursue my dream into agriculture even more when he passed.""

The teenager advises anyone who is grieving to seek help from organisations such as Treetops. ""If any young person feels angry or sad or alone, just know that you are not alone there is always somebody that will help,"" says Harvey. ""The first step is the hardest but it will be the best thing you will ever do in your life.""

Frank Rubio was cleared of blame after a tomato that went missing in space was found months later, following teasing from his crewmates who joked he had eaten it

A NASA astronaut has been 'exonerated' after a tomato lost in space was found months later.

Frank Rubio was cleared of blame after a tomato that went missing in space was found months later. He had been accused of losing or even eating one of the first tomatoes ever grown in space, which led to hours of searching on the space station.

Rubio planned to show the tomato to school children during a public event and was even jokingly accused by his colleagues of secretly eating it. However, the mystery of the missing space tomato has finally been solved. Rubio said: ""I put it in a little bag, and one of my crewmates was doing a (public) event with some schoolkids, and I thought it'd be kind of cool to show the kids - 'Hey guys, this is the first tomato harvested in space!'""

In space, where astronauts rely on freeze-dried food for months on end, a fresh tomato grown under plant lights is a treasure. But good intentions can sometimes go wrong. ""I was pretty confident that I Velcroed it where I was supposed to Velcro it... and then I came back, and it was gone,"" continued Rubio.

Anything not tied down in space can float away and get lost in the vastness of the International Space Station. Rubio spent hours looking for the missing tomato. He added: ""Unfortunately - because that's just human nature - a lot of people are like, 'He probably ate the tomato'.""

""I wanted to find it mostly so I could prove like I did not eat the tomato,"" joked the respected astronaut. But despite searching for between eight and 20 hours, he never found it.

Rubio returned to Earth on September 27, leaving the missing tomato behind on the space station. He thought it had probably shrivelled and rotted by the time he got back.

However, during a news conference on Wednesday, the remaining seven-person crew on the space station revealed they had finally found the tomato. ""Rubio had 'been blamed for quite a while for eating the tomato,'"" said NASA astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli, ""But we can exonerate him.""

The astronauts didn't reveal where the tomato was found or what state it was in. Rubio had guessed in October that it might have shrivelled into an unrecognisable rot due to the humidity at the space station. ""it probably desiccated to the point where you couldn't tell what it was,"" he said. He thought the case was closed after that.

Rubio's return to Earth in September was a historic moment. His stay on the space station, which lasted more than a year, set a record for the longest a US astronaut has ever spent in microgravity.

Originally, Rubio planned to spend only six months aboard the International Space Station. However, he ended up staying 371 days after a coolant leak was discovered in his original ride, a Russian Soyuz spacecraft, while it was docked to the orbiting outpost. In an interview in October, Rubio admitted that parts of the journey were tough.

""I kind of allowed myself a day to feel sad and sorry for myself, and then I try to really make a conscious decision to say OK let's have a good attitude and let's just try to do the best job possible,"" Rubio said when he learned that his mission would be extended by months.

A steam engine crashed through a house and into the living room in a bizarre incident in Great Dunmow, Essex, this afternoon. The driver was left in a 'state of shock'

Residents in an Essex house were left shocked when a steam engine crashed into their house.

The incident occurred Great Dunmow this afternoon, and police and the fire service attended the scene.

None of the people in the house at the time were believed to have been harmed in the bizarre incident.

Efforts to recover the vehicle are now underway.

Local reports by the Essex County Standard said witnesses saw the engine ""having issues"" with ""steam and smoke coming out of the bottom"".

Jordan Bright was present at the scene and said there was ""significant damage to the property"", the BBC reported.

Mr Bright said the driver of the vehicle was ""in a state of shock following the crash"".

The street was partially closed as authorities attended to the incident.

Reports indicated the engine was on its way to the Saffron Walden Crank Up weekend steam show, a steam and vintage vehicle show that dated back to the 1970s.

A video of the aftermath showed the steam engine resting up against a property on the street, with one person unhelpfully joking: ""You can't park there, sir"".

On Facebook, one person commented: ""Thank god no one was on the footpath at that time.""

The writing on the steam engine said it was from the 'Claude Jessett Collection'.

Heritage Machines, a website dedicated to old machines, said: ""After The Claude Jessett Trust, based at Hadlow Down in East Sussex, had completed the programme of erecting new buildings and workshops to house the vast collection of steam, railway and agricultural artefacts accumulated over many years by the late Claude Jessett and his wife Joyce, priority has been given to restoring the steam engines, some of which had been left stored in the older buildings for some time.""

A mystery dog illness is baffling vets and public health officials across the US, and owners have been urged to quarantine their dogs if they suspect they may have come down with the disease

Dog owners have been put on alert by public health officials as a mystery respiratory illness sweeps across several US states.

The unknown disease is baffling experts who are unsure of its origin, transmission and how it can be treated. Multiple dog deaths have been recorded as a result of the disease which has spread across California, Colorado, Oregon, New Hampshire and other states.

Colorado has noted at least 200 cases already since mid-August, with the disease believed to have spread to 10 US states so far. But officials are struggling to understand the disease meaning there is no specific diagnosis - and no tried-and-tested treatment.

A dog is believed to have picked up the mystery illness when they have certain respiratory symptoms - including coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge and tiredness - but test negative on other known diseases with similar symptoms. To be diagnosed with the disease, the dog must also have one of the following: rapidly-progressing pneumonia, chronic pneumonia that is unresponsive to antibiotics, or a respiratory infection for at least six weeks with no response to antibiotics.

The illness is being referred to as atypical canine infectious respiratory disease (aCIRD) and public health officials are urging the public to look out for the symptoms - and take your pet to the vet if necessary. As officials continue to search for clues as to what the disease is, it is important that as many cases as possible are reported.

Your dog should isolate at home for at least 28 days after it becomes ill, as it is unclear how the disease is transmitted. Keep the canine away from other dogs in the household in order to prevent the disease from spreading. Officials have also urged owners not to leave their dog at day-care centres, kennels, and dog parks due to the fear of the disease spreading, LA Times reported.

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .

While the disease can bring on nasty symptoms for a dog, David Needle, senior veterinary pathologist at the University of New Hampshire's (UNH) Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, doesn't believe it is particularly fatal. It is more of a chronic respiratory illness, he said: ""I think a subset of animals can develop pneumonia, more or less like upper respiratory, bronchitis, rhinitis, tracheitis.""

Researchers at the UNH lab along with the school's Hubbard Center for Genome Studies believe they may have found a bacterium that is behind the symptoms - but it is unclear whether it is responsible for all instances of the disease. In contrast, the Oregon Department of Agriculture believes it is viral due to the ineffectiveness of antibiotics in combatting the disease.

Animal Humane Society's Director of Veterinarian Medicine Dr. Graham Brayshaw said the disease is likely to spread much further than it has so far. ""If there's a disease moving around in multiple states, if it's not here, it's probably passed through here or it's going to come here at some point,"" he said.

Dr Brayshaw offered advice to those who suspect their dogs may have the disease: ""Make sure they stay hydrated. They can get secondary bacterial infections, so sometimes antibiotics are necessary. If you are worried about your dog having these signs, reach out to your veterinarian, we have treatments we can do to support your dog through the virus.""

Mary Earps, Millie Bright and Lauren Hemp joined diverse figures from Sajid Javid, Tim Martin, Tony Blackburn and the Archbishop of Canterbury on the New Year Honours List

More than 1,200 unsung heroes - as well as well known figures from the world of sport, showbiz and politics - have been recognised in the New Year Honours list.

Lionesses trio Millie Bright, Mary Earps and Lauren Hemp are among the big names included. And nine-year-old Tony Hudgell, who has changed the lives of thousands after suffering horrific abuse as a baby, is the youngest recipient.

And there were also awards for singers Leona Lewis and Dame Shirley Bassey, as well as Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke and broadcasters Paul Hollywood, Jeff Stelling and Tony Blackburn.

Rugby heroes Kevin Sinfield and Rob Burrow were given CBEs - short of the knighthood they'd been tipped for, while Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby was made Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (RVO) by the King in recognition of his prominent role in the coronation. Here we look at some of the highlights - with the full list below.

Sport

Three members of the Lionesses World Cup team have picked up awards after their heroics in the summer.

And Rob Burrow and Kevin Sinfield were awarded CBEs services to Motor Neurone Disease Awareness.

TV, showbiz and arts

Game of Thrones actress Emelia Clarke has been awarded an MBE for her work with charity SameYou, which she founded. It provides vital support for people with brain injuries.

Singer Leona Lewis also picked up an OBE for her contributions to music and charity. And national treasure Dame Shirley Bassey was awarded one of the most coveted Damehoods going, becoming just the 64th living member of the Order of the Companions of Honour.

Other big names given the nod included Paul Hollywood , who got an MBE for services to baking and broadcasting, while Rishi Sunak's favourite author, Jilly Cooper, becomes a Dame. Glastonbury Festival founder Michael Eavis is knighted for services to music and charity, while film director Sir Ridley Scott had his knighthood upgraded. DJ Tony Blackburn was awarded an OBE, and fellow DJ Steve Wright got an MBE. Game of Thrones star Oliver Ford Davies also got an OBE for services to drama. There was also an OBE for retail expert and Mary Queen of Shops TV star Mary Portas.

Politics

Former Home Secretary, Health Secretary and Chancellor Sajid Javid has become a Sir. He was among the politicians to pick up gongs, with Labour stalwart Siobhain McDonagh becoming a Dame. The list also saw Dame Margaret Beckett's Damehood upgraded.

Labour's Yvonne Fovargue received a CBE, while Tory backbencher Mark Garnier - who was once investigated for asking his secretary to buy sex toys - was made an OBE. The Cabinet Office later found he had not broken the ministerial code.

Kim Jong-un is thought to be grooming his daughter Kim Ju-ae to become his successor after he brought the 10-year-old to several public events, including a missile launch site

The recently unveiled daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is being home-schooled and spends her leisure time horseback riding, skiing and swimming, South Korea's spy agency has said.

Kim has brought the daughter to a series of public events since November, including a missile launch site, sparking intense outside debate over whether the girl, reportedly named Kim Ju-ae and about 10-years-old, is being primed as his successor.

The South Korean government has assessed that Kim, 39, hasn't anointed her as his heir.

But it says he likely aims to use his daughter's appearances as a way to show his people that one of his children would one day inherit his power in what would be the country's third hereditary power transfer.

In a closed-door parliamentary committee meeting Tuesday, the National Intelligence Service maintained that assessment, saying Kim Jong-un is still too young and healthy to appoint his successor, according to Yoo Sang-bum, one of the lawmakers who attended the session.

The NIS said the daughter's unveiling largely appeared intended to underscore the imperativeness of another hereditary power succession, Yoo told reporters.

The NIS told lawmakers that Kim Ju-ae has never been enrolled at an official education facility and is taking homeschooling in Pyongyang, Yoo said. He quoted the NIS as saying her hobbies are horseback riding, skiing and swimming.

The NIS said it has an information that Kim Ju-ae is ""very good at horseback riding"" and that Kim Jong-un is satisfied with that, the lawmaker said.

Last month, Kim Jong-un and his daughter took center stage at a Pyongyang military parade, which featured a ceremonial cavalry unit trotting through the parade plaza riding white horses - a symbol associated with the Kim family's dynastic rule.

The North's state TV described one of the animals as ""most beloved"" by Kim Ju-ae.

The NIS also said that Kim Ju-ae has an elder brother and a younger sibling whose gender is still unknown. It said reports that Kim's first child, a son, has mental or physical problems haven't been verified, according to the lawmaker.

Some experts say it's almost certain that Kim Ju-ae is her father's successor because state media have called her Kim Jong-un's ""most beloved"" or ""respected"" child and published images showing her closeness with her father.

But others disagree, citing Kim's relative young age and the extremely male-dominated nature of North Korea's power hierarchy.

Since its foundation in 1948, North Korea has been successively ruled by male members of the Kim family: Kim's father Kim Jong-il and his grandfather and state founder Kim Il-sung.

The name of Ju-ae matched what retired NBA star Dennis Rodman called Kim's baby daughter, whom he said he saw and held during his trip to Pyongyang in 2013.

The NIS has a spotty record in confirming developments in the secretive North. It often releases its finding on North Korea through a parliamentary committee meeting.

Meeting with reporters alongside Yoo, lawmaker Youn Kun-young quoted the NIS as saying that it's difficult to estimate the exact number of people in North Korea who have recently died of a worsening food shortage.

He said the NIS told lawmakers that starvation-related deaths in North Korea aren't serious enough to threaten the North's system.

Experts say the North's food situation is the worst it has been under Kim's 11-year rule, but maintain they see no signs of imminent famine or mass deaths.

The NIS assessed the North's food problem is attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic, its agricultural policy and an issue of grain distribution.

Lonely Planet has named Porth Iago as the best wild camping beach in Wales while the campsite adjoining won the North Wales category of Channel 4's The Perfect Pitch series

A beach with golden sands surrounded by breathtaking landscapes, not to mention views of dolphins and 'the best sunset ever'; it may sound like it's in the Caribbean, but this gorgeous stretch of sand is actually right here in the UK.

In fact, Brits have 'rediscovered' the small sheltered beach of Porth Iago on the wester tip of North Wales. In its heyday during the 1970s, it was truly bustling.

The nearby 30-acre campsite would be full of holidaymakers, and the beach was hailed as one of the best to be found, North Wales Live reports.

A death in the Ty Mawr farming family who owned the land surrounding the campsite saw pitching up on the stretch of land that leads to the beach all but come to a complete end. As a result, the beautiful cove became far quieter.

When the coronavirus pandemic struck and holidays abroad were off the cards, travel-starved Brits began rediscovering the beach and its popularity soared once more.

The site has been ""rediscovered"" by beach goers who are enchanted by its natural beauty, wildlife, turquoise waters and sunset views.

While that has seen the now-eight acre campsite get back up and running, the beach's popularity has started to cause problems, with coach-loads of sunseekers having to be turned away from the site.

The entire 2023 camping season was booked up even before the last one ended, and many regulars return year after year. After all, there's a reason why Lonely Planet named Porth Iago as the best wild camping beach in Wales, not to mention the site also won the North Wales category of Channel 4's The Perfect Pitch series.

Visitors have been full of praise with one person describing it as a ""little utopia"". They added: ""With no hint of hyperbole, this little sandy cove with crystal clear water is one of the best beaches In the world in my opinion.""

Another said: ""I had the experience of the best sunset ever from this location. This camping trip will be in my top 10 favourites ever.""

The area's wildlife has also proven a hit. One couple who visited last summer wrote: ""In this bay alone we saw sand eel, wrasse, crabs, baby jellyfish fish and small whiting. The next day we were spoilt by a display of dolphins.""

However, Chris has opened up on the challenges the area is now facing as its fanbase grows on social media. ""People have begun coming in coaches but we're not a big site and there's no way we can allow that,"" he said.

""Last summer a coach party from Birmingham called to ask if they could come and we said that, unfortunately, they couldn't. They came anyway, so we had to turn them back. They drove all the way back to Birmingham.""

For those who do it make to the beach, day visitors can pay a £5 parking charge to explore the headlands or clamber down to the sandy beach for a dip.

Passing walkers on the Wales Coast Path need only pay £1. While there are no facilities on the beach, the campsite has a toilet and shower block while a burger van offers a lifeline for guests in the form of bacon baps, sausage rolls and ice-cream, as well as freshly-made pizza.

However, despite the clear demand in the area, and the potential to increase revenue, Chris has no plans to expand the campsite.

""There are no shops in heaven,"" he said. ""You can't take your money with you.""

Former couple Amanda and Clive Owen stunned Our Yorkshire Farm fans when they posed for a rare family photo with their kids at Ravenseat Farm on the weekend

Our Yorkshire Farm's Amanda and Clive Owen reunited on the weekend for a family photo.

The former couple called it quits last year after telling fans the decision was the 'right choice for their family'.

However, they looked like pleased to be in each other's company recently as they grinned in a picture with their kids.

The snap was shared by their daughter Raven, who also posted a video of mum Amanda, 48, enjoying herself on a tree swing.

Clive, 58, recently revealed why he and Amanda split up - blaming himself, ""massively"".

Speaking on the Lorraine show, he said: ""I sadly made a right mess of things basically. I had a massive part to play in the relationship ending. A massive part to play. I was ranting and raving and drinking and carrying on. I don't know - jealousy.

""It seemed to eat away at me and I handled it badly and I behaved badly towards her. I should have been supportive ... It's been really upsetting, Amanda's having a tough time at the moment. I just feel I can't sit back. I have to say something in her defence, she's a remarkable woman. We just got to the point where we couldn't be together anymore.""

Clive also explained that despite their separation, the couple still live close to each other and are very much in each other's lives.

He said: ""I live at the farm and she lives about half a mile away down the road. On a day-to-day basis, we work together, we farm together, we look after the kids together. She feeds us all, somehow she looks after two houses instead of one.""

Amanda is now said to be with a new man, businessman Robert Davies, 71, with the pair thought to be ""inseparable"" from one another.

They have yet to publicly confirm or deny their rumoured romance, but have known each other for five years.

A source told The Sun: ""Amanda and Robert have known each other many years - long before her split. Now he travels everywhere with her and they've become seemingly inseparable.""

Robert's fourth wife Jan Coates, 72, issued a warning to Amanda after hearing the news, saying: ""He is very charming but he is also very ruthless in the way he treats people. I think he gets bored easily.

""I can see what's happened. He loves fame and fortune. Once somebody is in love with someone they don't want to know. I would just say be very careful and think about your children.""

Legendary children's TV presenter Baroness Benjamin and Dame Elizabeth Anionwu OM have been handed prominent roles in the Westminster Abbey ceremony

The King has put diversity at the heart of his Coronation by inviting a broad range of society to be involved in the procession.

Legendary children's TV presenter Baroness Benjamin and Dame Elizabeth Anionwu OM, the last two members to join the elite Order of Merit by the late Queen, have been handed prominent roles in the Westminster Abbey ceremony.

Baroness Benjamin, who will carry the Sceptre with the Dove and while Dame Elizabeth will take the Orb to the altar, said: ""I feel honoured and privileged to be part of the historic Coronation ceremony.

""To be selected to carry the Sovereign's Sceptre with Dove, which represents spirituality, equity and mercy, is for me very symbolic as it's everything I stand for and sends out a clear message that diversity and inclusion is being embraced.""

Petty Officer Amy Taylor will be the first woman to bear the Jewelled Sword of Offering into the Abbey.

She has been selected to represent Service men and women, as a Royal Navy Petty Officer, a tribute to His Majesty's military career.

She said: ""I am deeply honoured and humbled to play my part in this historic event.

""Coming from a farming family His Majesty has always been such a great advocate for our community and someone I have admired growing up.""

The first processions into the Abbey on May 6 will be made up of faith leaders and representatives followed shortly afterwards by representatives from His Majesty's 15 Realms.

Flags of each Realm will be carried by national representatives accompanied by the Governors General and Prime Ministers.

Bearing the flag of the United Kingdom ahead of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Mrs Akshata Murty will be Cadet Warrant Officer Elliott Tyson-Lee, who said: ""It is a great and incredible honour to be a part of Their Majesties' Coronation Service as a representative of the Royal Air Force Air Cadets.""

The Procession of The King and The Queen which will be led by the Marquess of Anglesey and the Duke of Westminster - dubbed the ""most eligible bachelor in Britain after inheriting £9 billion at the age of 25 in 2016.

Francis Dymoke, who proved he would be the 34th member of his family to attend a coronation since William the Conqueror's will carry The Royal Standard.

The 67-year-old accountant-turned-farmer who lives in Lincolnshire had his claim to undertake a historic role in the Coronation upheld by the Coronation Claims Office.

The title of King or Queen's Champion has been held by the Dymoke family since the Middle Ages.

Alfred Swinscoe disappeared from the Pinxton Miners Arms in the pit village of Pinxton, Derbys, in 1967 after going outside to use a toilet, and his vanishing remaining a mystery for decades

Detectives say human remains found in a farmer's field are of a miner who was murdered after vanishing from his local pub over 50 years ago.

Alfred Swinscoe, 54, disappeared from the Pinxton Miners Arms in the pit village of Pinxton, Derbys, in 1967 after going outside to use a toilet.

His two sons and a friend, who he had been drinking with, raised the alarm when the dad-of-six failed to return to the bar.

Despite a police search and widespread local publicity, Alfred's disappearance remained a mystery for 56 years.

His remains were found following construction work on farmland in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Notts, a short walk from the pub, in April.

Scientists and an anthropologist determined the remains were of a man who was aged between 40 and 60 when he died.

Detectives said there was evidence he had been attacked and launched a murder investigation last month.

Alfred's grandson Russell Lowbridge, who was four when he vanished, came forward to say the victim may be his granddad.

DNA tests were carried out on Russell and Alfred's son, now in his 70s, and matched against the bones.

Further tests are being carried out to determine how he was killed and how long he had been buried at the site.

Alfred, a champion pigeon racer known as 'Sparrow', worked at Langton Colliery from the age of 14.

Four of his six children are still alive and he has a number of grandchildren.

Alfred's daughter Julie, now 82, said she ""doesn't want to go to her grave"" never knowing what happened to her dad.

She said: ""I was 25 at the time, a factory worker and I remember coming

home one day from work and people saying they couldn't find dad.

""He had gone missing, and the police were searching. We all thought it was very mysterious, but we thought he would turn up.

""It does make you wonder how we did cope through all these years because it has always stayed with us as a family. Where did dad go?

""We might be able to now give my dad the funeral he deserves but we don't have the answers we desperately want.

""Someone killed my dad and I want to know why.""

Grandson Russell, 60, said Alfred's son Gary, who died in 2012, was ""haunted"" by his dad's disappearance his whole life.

""He wouldn't let it go, especially as he was in the pub with him the night he went missing,"" he said.

""He just remembers his dad giving him a ten bob note - telling him to get a round and then never ever seeing him again.

""He would go back to Pinxton at the time and even search down disused wells and even hired a private detective near the end.

""It completely broke him, never knowing what happened to his dad. It tormented him up until the day he died.""

Asst Chief Const Rob Griffin, of Derbyshire Police, said his detectives will try to find Alfred's killer.

He said: ""I cannot imagine how distressing this must have been for Alfred's family who have been waiting 56 years for answers.

""Some of Alfred's family members are no longer alive and will have died never knowing what happened to their loved one that night.

""All they know is Alfred went to the pub one evening and then never came home.

""Despite this happening more than 50 years ago, this will not stop us from using all our investigative skills to find those responsible.""

Jeremy Clarkson is set to earn millions after being reportedly offered a three series deal with Amazon Prime of his TV show Clarkson's Farm.

The show follows the former Top Gear host attempt to run his own farm in the Cotswolds, which first aired in 2021 showing him struggle to get to grips with Didly Squat farm. Although Jeremy, 63, has not signed the lucrative deal as yet, it has been reported that he could earn an eye-watering figure of more than £200 million.

The second series, which aired in February this year was the most watched show on the streaming platform in the UK. And if signed, the third series should air by March or April next year.

The upcoming series is said to be focusing on pigs and according to his co-star Kaleb Cooper, who is the young farm hand on the show, he is ""annoyingly"" good as a pig farmer. He has previously said: ""I can't say too much because I'll be told off, but Jeremy's bought some pigs this year. And, annoyingly, he's a really good pig farmer.""

And on the back of the show's success, Jeremy Clarkson's latest book titled Diddly Squat: Pigs Might Fly was an instant best-seller last month when it hit the shelves. But last December his TV career looked as though it was hanging in the balance. Jeremy aired his views on Meghan Markle in his Sun column where he made the controversial comments- for which he later apologised.

At the time he wrote: ""At night, I'm unable to sleep as I lie there, grinding my teeth and dreaming of the day when she [Meghan] is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while the crowds chant 'Shame!' and throw lumps of excrement at her"".

He also raged: ""But what makes me despair is that younger people, especially girls, think she's pretty cool. They think she was a prisoner of Buckingham Palace, forced to talk about nothing but embroidery and kittens."" Following his comments he issued an apology after it generated more than 20,000 complaints.

In his apology he tweeted: ""Oh dear. I've rather put my foot in it. I'm horrified to have caused so much hurt and I shall be more careful in future."" He continued to say: ""In a column I wrote about Meghan, I made a clumsy reference to a scene in Game of Thrones and this has gone down badly with a great many people.""

And his own daughter Emily made it incredibly clear that she did not want the public to assume she was standing by her dad's side. She said: ""I want to make it very clear that I stand against everything my dad wrote about Meghan Markle."" And he issued another apology in January the following year amid hoards of complaints by the public on social media.

Sammi Kinghorn was involved in a tragic accident at the age of 14 on her family farm before she became a multi-medallist Paralympic wheelchair racer and TV presenter

Countryfile star Sammi Kinghorn has shared the last moment she ever felt her legs after a tragic accident left her paralysed.

The TV star was just 14 years old when she was injured in the horrific incident, and credits sport for helping her to 'really accept' her new reality and live life to the fullest. Sammi, now 27, is the fastest female British wheelchair racer of all time and has become a familiar face on our screens presenting the beloved BBC show.

The Paralympic athlete-turned-presenter was a teenager playing on her family's farm in Scotland during the winter of 2010, when she jumped on her dad's forklift and ended up getting crushed.

Her father had been using the truck to clear snow and had no idea his daughter was there. In an interview earlier this year, as reported by The Scottish Farmer, Sammi recalled the exact moment everything changed: ""I remember feeling an immense amount of pressure on the top of my head and the first feeling I felt was guilt. What was I thinking? My dad is going to lose his job and his daughter. Why have you done this?""

Sammi remembers sliding out from the forklift and running out of its path, and that was the last time she ever felt her legs. She spent the next six months on a spinal unit in a Glasgow hospital, and recalls feeling in 'awe' of her first wheelchair. ""It wasn't something that was a disability, it was something that enabled me to go out and see my friends, and live my life fully. I was so excited that day and knew I wouldn't be stuck in bed forever,"" she said.

The presenter added that she ""can't imagine the pain my dad still carries day-to-day"", but hopes her success and happiness ""takes the burden off his shoulders"". While she once dreamed of being a zoologist, Sammi is now a double Paralympic medalist and TV host on Britain's much-loved programme.

Speaking about her newfound love for sport soon after the accident, Sammi told the Scotsman back in 2012: ""I thought I'd be in a bed forever. So, to then get into a wheelchair was amazing. I know it sounds strange, but I was so happy. Then to find I could actually compete in sport in my wheelchair has just been incredible. Sport has helped me hugely, helped me to really accept it.""

Heavyweight legend 'Iron Mike' is known for his admiration of pigeons and he recently flew to a remote village in Poland to buy 100 of them

Mike Tyson made nearly a 6000 mile trip to a remote village in Poland all for his love of pigeons.

Boxing legend 'Iron Mike' travelled all the way from Las Vegas to Piatnica Poduchowna, a village three hours north of Warsaw with a population of just 1,800. The former heavyweight world champion stunned locals in the village by meeting with a local pigeon dealer to buy not just one but 100 of the birds.

Tyson's face is no stranger to those in Poland, as it was plastered on an energy drink sold in the country called ' Mike Tyson 's Black Sex Energy'. The drink was a bestseller in Poland and even found its way onto the shelves of UK supermarkets such as Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda.

What are your thoughts on Mike Tyson's love of pigeons? Let us know in the comments section below

'Iron Mike' found peace through pigeons in his youth as he said: ""I always loved pigeons ever since I was a child. They teach us the importance of being compassionate. They were my escape. I was fat and ugly. Kids teased me all the time, the only joy I had was pigeons.""

""I tried (to eat one). I was dating this young lady and she said ""˜I don't know why you're flying those damn birds, you should be eating them'. She happened to grab one and cooked one and proceeded to eat it and I just couldn't do it. It just wasn't the right thing to do. That's why she's not my woman anymore.""

Not only were pigeons the catalyst to the end of a previous relationship, but they were also the reason Tyson got into his first ever fight. Long before his days as the most feared man on the planet, Tyson knocked out a binman who put the body of his favourite pigeon in a dumpster.

""One morning I woke up and found my favourite pigeon, Julius, had died. I was devastated and was gonna use his crate as my stickball bat to honour him. I left the crate on my stoop and went in to get something and I returned to see the sanitation man put the crate into the crusher. I rushed him and caught him flush on the temple with a titanic right hand! He was out cold, convulsing on the floor,"" Tyson said.

Love Island's Will has broken his silence on the rumoured feud between himself and his ""brothers"" Casey and Tom as he focuses his time on girlfriend Jessie

Love Islander Will Young has broken his silence on the feud between his ""brothers"" Casey O'Gorman and Tom Clare as he spends more time with Jessie.

It follows rumours circulating the trio have fallen out despite creating strong friendships in the ITV villa.

Since all contestants have returned to the UK, it seems Tom and Casey have remained close but Will has been spending time with girlfriend Jessie Wynter.

Farmer Will, 23, has been prioritising his Aussie beau, 26, as they admitted they are focusing on ""ourselves"".

""I was pretty close with Tom and Casey in the villa, you know, the three musketeers!

""But kind of outside me and Jessie are just focusing on ourselves,"" Will said on The Useless Hotline Podcast.

Jessie added: ""We've been out on the farm, it's really hard, they're all like 'Come to Manchester' and it's like babe we're so far away! It would take us a day to get there.""

There previously appeared to be some tension between Will and Casey following their departures from the ITV show as footage shown on Aftersun showed Casey discussing an interaction he had with Jessie.

He said it ""seemed like such an act"". During another scene, he suggested that she was ""playing a game"" in the villa.

Last month rumours of a feud between the boys had been fuelled after Will was left out of a reunion.

The speculation continued as Casey visited Tom in Barnsley, without Will.

However, a spokesperson for Tom told the Mirror: ""There is no feud between the Three Musketeers, since coming out of the villa all of them have been busy and they look forward to reuniting soon. There's regular contact between all three.""

Instead of returning home to Tasmania, personal trainer Jessie flew back to Buckinghamshire with Will after they were dumped from the villa before the final.

The couple were happy to put the drama in South Africa behind them, after fellow islanders turned on Jessie in their last week, branding her ""fake"" in a storm of sniping and backbiting.

The pair also admitted they came close to quitting the show after Will kissed bombshell Layla Al-Mamani, 28, when the girls were away in Casa Amor.

Since leaving the show, Jessie said: ""We've been having an absolute blast. We've got me to the farm, we've got back to the country.

"" We went to Tesco for our first date - we did the big shop, picked up some snacks. Then we went to the village pub for steak and chips and a chicken burger. It was so nice to get out of the villa, and since we've left we've been a lot happier. We don't have people interfering in our relationship.""

Will revealed he can't wait to start his new life with girlfriend Jessie.

He said: ""I wouldn't be with her if I thought she wasn't marriage material. Our plan is to split our time between the UK and Tasmania.""

After years of drought in California, US, the rain could have been welcome... but the deluge swamped already clogged storm drains and flooded the garage and the cars within

A flash flood left 20 cars underwater and residents forced to evacuate as widespread flooding devastated parts of California, US.

Residents had to be put up in a nearby hotel after the parking garage of the block of flats in Oakland was swamped.

The New Year's Eve deluge that swamped the West Coast state killed one person, prompted the evacuation of more than 1,000 inmates in a county jail, and even washed away a section of a levee system that protects mostly rural farmland.

One resident displaced from the block in Oakland told ABC7News through tears: ""It's emotional because we went from having a home to my kids being homeless.""

According to witnesses, the water was muddy brown with rubbish floating in it.

According to an email sent to people living in the apartment block, clogged storm drains caused the flood waters to rush in on New Year's Eve and will take days to pump back out.

DaVina Brown said, ""I am angry. I have two cars that are gone now. I don't have no transportation. I'm displaced. I'm out of my place and I work from home.""

Even after the storm moved through, major flooding occurred in agricultural areas about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Sacramento, where rivers swelled beyond their banks and inundated dozens of cars along State Route 99.

Emergency crews rescued motorists on New Year's Eve into Sunday morning and the highway remained closed. Crews on Sunday found one person dead inside a submerged vehicle near Route 99.

Now Californians are bracing for more extreme weather with crews rushing to repair levees broken in the earlier flooding.

Crews hope to finish repairs before the next storm is forecasted to hit on Wednesday January 4. If they can't, they'll seal whatever progress they have made with plastic and sandbags and hope for the best.

A weather phenomenon known as an ""atmospheric river"" dumped up to five inches (12.70 centimetres) of rain in the Sacramento region, and up to a foot (30.48 centimetres) of snow in the mountains on Saturday, said Eric Kurth, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.

In Southern California, several people were rescued after flood waters inundated cars in San Bernardino and Orange County. Thankfully no major injuries were reported there.

Many crews were left without power following the storm.

The rain was welcomed in drought-parched California as the past three years have been the state's driest on record. Most of the state's major reservoirs were still well below their historical averages. The one exception was Folsom Lake near Sacramento, which was at 153 percent of its historical average on Sunday.

Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy lives with his partner Rebekah and children, but firefighters were forced to respond after an outbuilding was reported to be on fire

Local firefighters were called to tackle a blaze in an outbuilding of Jamie Vardy's plush Lincolnshire mansion on Thursday afternoon.

The fire, which originated from the Leicester City striker's outdoor gym at 3.20pm was put out by Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue Service, but not before ""severe damage"" was sustained. Thankfully, no one was hurt in the incident.

A statement from the local fire service told LincolnshireLive: "" Firefighters were called to reports of an outbuilding on fire at 3.20pm on January 19.

""The fire resulted in severe damage to 90 per cent of a wooden outbuilding being used as a gym and the equipment. Crews used four breathing apparatus, one hose reel and one thermal imaging camera to extinguish the fire.""

It has also been confirmed that the source of the fire was an electrical fault.

The Vardys live in a Grade II-listed building, worth a reported £2.5million, in a small village around 30 minutes away from Leicester.

Rebekah paid tribute to the responding fire fighters, posting on social media: ""Every cloud and all that. Thankfully no one was hurt""¦. Buildings and contents are replaceable and the kiddies enjoyed the fire engines. Thank you for being so brilliant @lincolnshirefirerescue.""

A nearby resident told LincolnshireLive: ""There was a fire yesterday, I saw two fire engines, one on the drive and one outside. We were just popping out and we saw flashing lights.""

Another woman who can see the Vardys' house from hers said: ""I didn't see anything apart from a few fire engines outside for a while. They were there most the afternoon and that's it really.""

The Vardys' luxurious mansion has an indoor pool, a sauna, a tennis court, and a gym. The once eight-bedroom home was given permission to be extended by adding a major four-bedroom extension in 2020.

Last year, the couple submitted plans to build a stable complex on a vast amount of land near their property. Plans include a yard, stables and paddock over a total area of 5,482 sq. metres.

The proposal was described as 'change of use from agricultural paddock to equestrian including new stable building and yard for residential purposes only.'

Jamie and Rebekah wed in 2016 and have three children together - Sofia, Finley, and Olivia Grace. Rebekah is also mum to Megan and Taylor from previous relationships.

As for Jamie, his Leicester future remains up in the air. The Foxes legend still has another 18 months on his contract but there have been suggestions he could leave the King Power Stadium.

Last summer, Manchester United were linked with a move for the 36-year-old, who made history in helping Leicester to their miraculous title triumph in 2016.

The Mirror's new interactive map lets you type in your postcode to find beaches near you where pollution levels have reached the point where swimming could become dangerous

England's most polluted beaches have been revealed - and thanks to our interactive map you can check if your local seaside haunt is on the list.

Now that the evenings are longer and warm summer's afternoons are around the corner, taking a day trip to the coast will be on many people's minds.

Sadly for those who love nothing more than sprinting into the refreshing sea spray or feeling the sand between their toes, relentless sewage dumping by water companies has left many beaches in a sorry state.

In January Anglian Water was slapped with a £510,000 fine after raw sewage was discharged into a river for 23 hours killing 5,000 fish, the Environment Agency said.

About six million litres of raw sewage was pumped into the Great Ouse at Brackley, Northamptonshire, during the incident - something wild swimmers would definitely want to avoid.

This horrifying incidence is just one of many.

Our new interactive map lets you type in your postcode to find beaches near you where pollution levels have reached the point where swimming could become dangerous.

Not only does it tell you if getting in the water in those spots is advised against, it lets you know if it has lost its Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs designated swimming zone status.

There are are a number of beaches highlighted which people should look to avoid as the water quality was so poor, including popular spots such as Blackpool North and Weston-super-Mare, as well as the River Wharfe in Ilkley.

In Blackpool the problem has partly been caused by gulls congregating beneath the North Pier to eat the fish and chip scraps left there, according to Cllr Jane Hugo, the city's cabinet member for climate change and environment.

The birds then defecate in the sea, contaminating the water.

The government has said Weston-super-Mare's beach has ben polluted thanks to combined effort from dogs, seabirds and a nearby sewage treatment works.

iWharfe, a consortium of local environmental activist groups in Ilkley, said the River Wharfe had been contaminated by a combination of faecal matter and agricultural runoff.

Professor Becky Malby of Ilkley Clean River Group told the Wharfedale Observer that the river had become a ""public health hazard"".

Beaches where swimming is not advised

Sewage discharges occur in the seas around Britain's coast regularly and are allowed to happen when there is particularly heavy rainfall.

This, water companies claim, is in a bid to stop the sewage system from becoming overwhelmed.

It has been heavily criticised and accusations of funding cuts and deregulation have been levelled at the government.

Ministers argued they are working to tackle discharges and cut them by a quarter by 2025.

Last year Labour revealed that water companies in England and Wales are pumping raw into the environment every two-and-a-half minutes.

Water companies told the Environment Agency that they they dumped raw sewage into rivers and seas 372,544 times last year, the Guardian reported.

Scientists have discovered a new species of trapdoor spider in Australia that could cause a bite that is 'physically painful' if they come into contact with humans. Female euoplos dignitas spiders can live up to 20 years

A new ""rare and giant"" spider that could bite humans and hides in things dubbed ""cryptic trapdoors"" has been discovered by scientists.

Arachnologist Michael Rix said the new species of trapdoor spider could cause a bite that is ""physically painful"" and the females can live up to 20 years in the wild.

Despite not being dangerous to humans, arachnophobes are unlikely to agree with the spider's name, which is taken from the Latin for dignity and greatness.

They have venom apparatus in the fangs, but none of the Australian trapdoor spiders in the group are known to be dangerously venomous,"" Rix said.

Their size, however, could mean the bite is a little bit painful for any unfortunate human who wanders across the spider's lurking trap door.

The new species is big for a trapdoor spider but is still around the same size as a 50-pence piece.

Mr Rix said: ""The females, which are the larger trapdoor spiders of the two sexes, they're almost five centimetres in body length.""

The new arachnid was discovered in Queensland Museum's Project DIG in Australia, in the area of black soil near black soil around the towns of Eidsvold and Monto.

Trapdoor spiders earn their name from the door in the death they live under. Nocturnal creatures, they wait under the door and capture insects when they pass by, emerging from beneath the door to pounce.

Trap doors used by the spiders are likened to plugs and are made out of soil and silk.

'Euoplos dignitas' do use venom to kill, but are not dangerous to people.

Mr Rix said: ""They've got these really cryptic trapdoors in these woodland habitats on the ground and most people wouldn't even realise that they're there.""

He added: ""The males of this species are what we sort of call a really honey-red colour ""” they're really quite stunning.""

Male trapdoor spiders live for the first five to seven years of their lives in burrows until they come out to search for a mate.

Sadly the spider is likely threatened in the wild because it lives in such a small area of woodland that has been cleared.

""We think they're probably in a bit of trouble ""¦ but more work needs to be done to get a better handle of how much,' Rix added.

He continued: ""Places like the Brigalow Belt have been really heavily cleared for agriculture and stock and other land uses...

""They're not very good at getting around the landscape and dispersing ""” for example, compared to a flying insect.""

The new Duchess of Edinburgh Sophie enjoyed a playful moment with King Charles during Commonwealth Day - and it may have proved to be a telling hint at their sweet friendship and respect

It was a short blink and you'll miss it moment - the new Duchess of Edinburgh playfully shoulder-bumped King Charles on Commonwealth Day.

But despite it being over in mere seconds, it spoke volumes about the sweet bond between Sophie and her brother-in-law the new monarch.

Since marrying her husband Prince Edward, she has become a stalwart of the Royal Family - and was even dubbed a ""second daughter"" of the late Queen after they built a close relationship.

But despite her sad death, it seems the new monarch has just as much admiration for her and sees her as a key part of his slimmed-down monarchy...

Early days

Sophie's introduction to the Royal Family came in 1999 when she married Edward in a spectacular wedding at Windsor Castle.

Charles was at his younger brother's side as a supporter as he tied the knot with his bride.

Sophie, a former PR exec who once worked for Capital Radio, was born Sophie Rhys-Jones and like the Princess of Wales hails from a middle-class background with her parents sending her to private schools.

She and Edward were brought together by a mutual passion for the ancient sport of real tennis and romance blossomed between the pair.

They now have two children Lady Louise Windsor, 19, and 15-year-old James, Earl of Wessex.

Controversy

However, Sophie's early royal life was not without controversy and problems arose when she tried to combine her life as a royal with her professional career.

She was caught in a ""fake sheikh"" sting and accused of trying to use her status to promote her public relations business.

The ""Sophiegate"" newspaper controversy was hugely damaging, resulting in reports of indiscreet remarks about a string of public figures including Sir Tony Blair and Lord Hague.

It led to a lengthy inquiry into how working royals should be regulated and Sophie and Edward later stepped down from their individual careers to become full-time royals.

Bond with Queen

But despite early problems, Sophie forged a special bond with her mother-in-law the late Queen - which will have no doubt endeared her to her brother-in-law Charles.

Living just 10 miles away from Windsor Castle at their residence in Bagshot Park, Surrey, Sophie, Edward and their children frequently visited the Queen and would spend time together on long dog walks.

Sophie reportedly leant on Her Majesty when her own mother passed away in 2005 and they became close confidants.

The Queen personally invited her to travel to several church services and they're said to have watched old movies together.

And in 2021, following the death of Prince Philip, a royal source said Sophie had been a ""tremendous source of comfort to the Queen.""

When the Queen died last September, Sophie appeared devastated as she viewed the floral tributes left to the late monarch outside Balmoral.

Trusted worker

Since the late Queen died and Charles came to the throne, Sophie has remained among his trusted working royals that carry out engagements on behalf of the Firm - and has even been dubbed its ""secret weapon"".

And recently she's carried out trips to the United Nations in New York to talk about violence against women and girls - and even became the first royal to visit the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Her position in the royal family has become increasingly more important since the departure of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and in recent years she has chosen to highlight challenging issues.

In 2019 she publicly committed herself to supporting the UK's work helping victims of rape, sexual violence and exploitation in war.

In total, she is patron of more than 70 charities and organisations, with interests including agriculture, fashion, supporting people with disabilities, and the prevention of avoidable blindness in developing countries.

A source previously told the Mirror: ""Sophie's growing popularity with the public is also evident and she will take on a larger public profile in a new-look monarchy of King Charles.""

Playful moments

But it's not all work and no play for Charles and Sophie, and there have been several playful moments between the pair hinting at their fondness of each other.

Last year at Royal Ascot, they were seen sharing a joke with each other, and body language expert Judi James believes it showed their closeness.

She explained: ""Charles is spatially close to Sophie, leaving a large gap between himself and Camilla. Sophie tends to get on with most of the royals and appears to be trusted at a very high level.

""She and Charles are seen roaring with laughter here and when Charles moves in to kiss her as they greet she seems to perform a rather cheeky facial expression, suggesting they are close friends.

""Sophie's open-mouthed smile involves a rounding and a raising of the cheeks, making it look genuine and Charles's face is wreathed in creases that suggest good humour in her company.""

Meanwhile, Judi also spotted another very telling moment at Monday's Commonwealth Service.

In a blink-and-you-'ll-miss-it moment, a playful Sophie appeared to jokingly shoulder-bump Charles, who appeared eager to get on with proceedings.

She explained: ""Whether it was the upgrade to Duchess of Edinburgh or maybe just a response to Charles's slightly impatient-looking dithering as he waited to get on with the procession, but Sophie leant right in to give Charles a very playful shoulder-bump greeting, along with a very meaningful grin.""

Dominique Nuttall and Jesse Coleman have travelled up the east coast, along the entire north of Australia and down the west coast during a mammoth adventure around the country together

A couple travelling around Australia in a van revealed how they saved $50k (£27,000) in five months to fund their next trip - by living off $1 (52p) meals.

Dominique Nuttall, 23, moved to Australia from her hometown of Stalybridge, Manchester, UK, to travel - and met Aussie native Jesse Coleman, 30, out there.

The couple - who are currently based in the Pilbara, Western Australia - started their journey together in July 2021.

Since then, they have travelled up the east coast, along the entire north of Australia and down the west coast.

The couple bought a van together for $15,000 (£8,000) and have spent the last two years alternating between stints working to save money, then setting off travelling and living in their van.

Last year they decided to work for the whole of 2023 to save up enough to fund a whole year of travel in 2024.

They shared how they have banked $50,000 since they started saving in October 2022 - and have a saving goal of $200k (£109,000).

Dominique works an admin role and a hospitality role, at $35 (£19) per hour and $37 (£20) per hour respectively, while Jesse works as a labourer earning $36.50 per hour.

Both working 60 hour weeks, this allows them each to put away $1,500 (£814) a week in savings to work towards their goal.

Dominique said: ""2024 will be the year of just travelling. When I first moved to Australia, I realised I could work for a short time then I can enjoy myself with the money I saved. I know I'll enjoy it then because I worked to create the money. That's what we want to do.""

Dominique moved to Australia alone to travel after finishing college at the age of just 18.

While working on farms to get visa extensions 18 months later, she met Jesse -who is originally from Port Macquarie, New South Wales and they hit it off.

Jesse quit his nine to five job with a door manufacturing company so he and Dominique could travel the enormous country's coasts together.

Since then, they have travelled 70,000km together.

Jesse said: ""I was always going to go, I'm pretty adventurous. I wanted to leave my hometown - that's when Dominique suggested we do the travelling life.""

Dominique added: ""At the start I didn't think Jesse would drop everything to travel with me, but he did.""

They bought a van in July 2021 and began their journey from Port Macquarie, in New South Wales, and headed north.

The couple's routine involves working full-time for a few months to save up, then quitting their jobs and travelling in their van until they run out of funds, then repeating the process.

Some of Dominique's jobs include marketing, a barista, waitressing, bartending, solar farming, agricultural work, tractor driving, retail, admin work and housekeeping.

Some of Jesse's include working at a door manufacturing warehouse and at an air conditioning company.

Currently, Dominique is juggling hospitality and admin jobs, while Jesse is currently working as a process technician at an industrial waste facility.

Since last September they have been working 60-hour weeks to squirrel away their pay-checks - so next year they can complete their lap of Australia.

And after five months - having taken one month off for a trip to Bali before jumping back to the grind - they have $50,000 in the bank.

They have a goal of $200,000 to hit before they set off next year.

Dominique said: ""We are paid weekly and put $3k into our joint account each week.

""Since doing the van life we're both good at living off a budget - one-dollar meals.

""We love living cheap, living simply, just saving all our money and not spending on unnecessary things.""

Currently, their van life is on hold as Dominque's admin job comes with accommodation for a small weekly fee, and her food is covered by her work too.

Jesse works outside all day as a labourer in the blistering heat of the Pilbara, which is a remote dry mining town.

It is thinly populated due to its conditions, meaning wages are higher and their only main expenditure is food for Jesse.

They have a whiteboard in their bedroom which they use to visually track their savings and monitor when they hit saving milestones.

Dominque said: ""We want to complete our lap of Australia then do southeast Asia.

""We also want to go to Europe at some point.

""But we'll always use Australia as our base - and I'm in the process of applying for permanent residency.

""Being out here and doing what we do, it doesn't feel like real life.

""It's too good to be true.""

Breezy the Bengal show cat was left with a oil stained chin after spending over 24hours cowering in the corner of an Denver International Airport warehouse where they store oil

Breezy the Bengal show cat has been reunited with her owner after being found in a dark corner of Denver International Airport by a Southwest Airline crew.

Owner Ginger Thompson and the feline had been in Denver participating in a show but when they were getting onto a plane to fly back to their home in Spokane, Washington, Breezy escaped and disappeared.

The one-year-old Bengal got out of her carrier when someone bumped into it as they were getting onto the plane at Denver International Airport (DIA). Ginger frantically tried to coax Breezy back but the cat spooked and ran out the open plane door and fell through the gap between the plane and the bridge.

Ginger spent 24 hours ""losing hope"" Breezy would be found and was terrified she had been hurt badly in the fall from the plane. After a massive search effort was launched by ground crews at DIA, the spooked cat was found.

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.

Pictures shared on social media by Ginger showed a number of airport staff in high viz jackets searching around big crates of oil in a warehouse-looking storage room.

Announcing the cat had been found Ginger posted on Facebook: ""Breezy has been rescued and I'm waiting for her to work out how to get her. I want to that the crew from Southwest Candace, Byron, Christopher, Lee, Brianna, Charlie, and their supervisor Vic for the diligent efforts to rescue Breezy with care and keep me updated.""

She added she ""will stay her until Breezy is not so traumatized,"" and said: ""I'm going to buy a flight home with Alaskan airlines or if Breezy is too traumatized I'll rent a car and drive home.""

Another picture shows an alarmed looking Ginger wedged down a narrow gap.

Just hours before Breezy was found, Ginger had posted on her Facebook : ""It's been a little over 24 hours sense I lost Breezy. I'm going out of my mind worrying. Trying to be patient but laying here in the hotel waiting is killing me and I'm losing any hope as each hour passes.""

A fundraiser setup to help support Ginger as she waited in hope Breezy was found read: ""Lost and frightened, Breezy could be anywhere in the vicinity, possibly injured from a significant fall during her escape.""

A relieved Ginger later shared pics of Breezy safe and at home, grooming herself happily. The happy owner said: ""Her chin is no long it's bright white. Oily and greasy but safe.""

A spokesperson for the airport said U.S Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services helped look for the cat and worked with personnel from the airport. Ginger's search gained a lot of traction online and was shared widely by animal lovers.

The owner/ cat pair had travelled to Denver for a cat show at the Crowne Plaza Denver International Convention Center, where Breezy won an award in 14 of 17 finals. ""Breezy is more then a show kitty,"" Ginger said on Facebook. ""She and my other two are what keeps me going.""

Footage shows the moment the Russian missile tore through the outdoor market in the city of Kostiantynivka, near the front line in the Donetsk region, creating an inferno

A Russian missile strike killed 17 people and wounded dozens more after it struck an outdoor market in Ukraine.

It comes as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned to the country with more than $1 billion in new American funding to help in the fight against Vladimir Putin's invading forces, including military and humanitarian aid.

Blinken's fourth visit to the country was overshadowed by the strike in the city of Kostiantynivka, near the front line in the Donetsk region, that turned the marketplace into an inferno. It was one of the deadliest bombardments of civilians in the 18-month-old war. In addition to the dead, at least 32 people were injured.

""Those who know this place are well aware that it is a civilian area,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a news conference with the Danish prime minister in Kyiv. ""There aren't any military units nearby. The strike was deliberate."" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said such brutal Russian attacks underscore ""the importance of continuing to support the people of Ukraine.""

Blinken's visit was aimed at assessing Ukraine's 3-month-old counteroffensive and signaling continued U.S. support as some Western allies express worries about Kyiv's slow progress against invading Russian forces. ""We want to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs, not only to succeed in the counteroffensive but has what it needs for the long-term, to make sure that it has a strong deterrent,"" Blinken said. ""We're also determined to continue to work with our partners as they build and rebuild a strong economy, strong democracy.""

About $175 million of the total is in the form of weaponry to be provided from Pentagon stockpiles and another $100 million is in the form of grants to allow the Ukrainians to purchase additional arms and equipment, according to the State Department. Noting progress in the counteroffensive, Blinken said the new aid ""will help sustain it and build further momentum."" He said the new military assistance would be bolstered by the arrival of U.S. Abrams tanks in the fall and the training of Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets to complement training in Europe.

In addition to the military assistance, Blinken announced nearly $805 million in non-arms-related aid for Ukraine, including $300 million for law enforcement, $206 million in humanitarian aid, $203 million to combat corruption and $90.5 million for removing mines, the State Department said. The package also includes a previously announced $5.4 million transfer to Ukraine of frozen Russian oligarch assets.

The aid announced by Blinken comes from money previously approved by Congress. President Joe Biden has requested another $21 billion in military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine for the final months of 2023, but it's not clear how much - if any - will be approved. Many Republican lawmakers are wary of providing more aid, and the party's presidential front-runner, former President Donald Trump, has criticised U.S. financial support. Opinion polls also have shown a decline in support for the war by the American public.

Biden and the Pentagon have said repeatedly they will support Ukraine for as long as it takes. As of August 29, there was approximately $5.75 billion left in the already approved funding for weapons and equipment taken from existing Pentagon stocks. Blinken was to discuss other issues, including support for Ukraine's economy, building on his June announcement of $1.3 billion to help Kyiv rebuild, with a focus on modernizing its energy network, which was bombarded by Russia last winter.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said U.S. assistance to Ukraine ""can't influence the course of the special military operation"" - Moscow's euphemism for the war. Blinken arrived in Kyiv for an overnight visit hours after Russia launched a missile attack on the city.

On the train to Kyiv, Blinken met with the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, who was also on an official visit, and thanked her for Denmark's leadership in training Ukrainian pilots on F-16s and for promising to donate the fighter jets to Ukraine, according to State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.

Washington officials said there will be discussions of alternative export routes for Ukrainian grain following Russia's exit from the Black Sea Grain Initiative and its frequent attacks on port facilities in the Odesa region. Those alternatives may include new overland routes or ships hugging coastlines to keep out of international waters where they could be targeted by Russia's navy. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also mentioned the potential to develop the Danube River corridor for grain exports.

After arriving in Kyiv, Blinken laid a wreath at the city's Berkovetske cemetery to commemorate Ukrainian troops killed defending the country. In a meeting, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine is grateful the U.S. money is coming in the form of grants, not loans that would drive it into debt.

In other developments, Russia fired cruise missiles overnight at Kyiv in its first aerial attack on the capital since Aug. 30, according to Serhii Popko, the head of Kyiv's regional military administration. Debris from a downed missile caused a fire and damage but no casualties. One person was killed in the Odesa region in a Russian missile and drone attack on the port of Izmail that damaged grain elevators, administrative buildings and agricultural enterprises, authorities said.

The trip was Blinken's fourth to Ukraine since the war began, including one brief excursion over the Polish-Ukrainian border in March 2022, just a month after the Russian invasion. But it will be the first time America's top diplomat spends the night in Kyiv since January 2022, before the invasion, in what U.S. officials called another sign of American support.

Blinken's visit comes after some of Ukraine's allies have privately expressed concern that Ukrainian troops may fail to reach their objectives. While the U.S. has been concerned by some day-to-day battlefield setbacks, American officials said, they are still generally encouraged by Ukraine's handling of the military situation, particularly its air defense capabilities in knocking down Russian drones aimed at Kyiv.

Western analysts and military officials caution that the counteroffensive's success is far from certain and that it could take years to rid Ukraine of entrenched, powerfully armed and skilled Russian troops. Both sides will have to assess their supply shortages, with more battles of attrition likely over the winter. A long war could stretch deep into next year and beyond, according to experts.

Firefighters were forced to respond at the home of Jamie and Rebekah Vardy after an outbuilding was reported to be on fire on Thursday

Rebekah Vardy has thanked the fire services after her family home went up in a horror blaze.

The WAG, 40, took to Instagram on Friday to share a sweet snap of her children sitting in the fire engine as she shared her gratitude after the terrifying incident.

""Every cloud and all that. Thankfully no one was hurt,"" Rebekah wrote alongside the photo.

""Buildings and contents are replaceable and the kiddies enjoyed the fire engines. Thank you for being so brilliant.""

Local firefighters were called to tackle a blaze on an outbuilding of Rebekah and Jamie Vardy's plush Lincolnshire mansion on Thursday afternoon.

It is believed a fire, which originated from the Leicester City striker's outdoor gym was put out by the fire service, but not before major damage was sustained.

A statement from the local fire service told LincolnshireLive: ""Firefighters were called to reports of an outbuilding on fire at premises in Water Lane, Stainby at 3.20pm on January 19.

""The fire resulted in severe damage to 90 per cent of a wooden outbuilding being used as a gym and the equipment.""


After Rebekah shared the news of the fire on her Instagram, fans flocked to share their concern.

""OMG thank goodness you are all okay. Sending lots of love,"" one follower commented.
""That's so scary! Hope you're all okay,"" another wrote.

While a third shared: ""Oh Rebekah that's just terrible. Hope you and the family are all okay. Such a scare.""

The Vardys' luxurious mansion has an indoor pool, a sauna, a tennis court, and a gym. The once eight-bedroom home was given permission to be extended by adding a major four-bedroom extension in 2020.

Last year, the couple submitted plans to build a stable complex on a vast amount of land near their property. Plans include a yard, stables and paddock over a total area of 5,482 sq. metres.

The proposal was described as 'change of use from agricultural paddock to equestrian including new stable building and yard for residential purposes only.'

Colin Armstrong, former honorary consul of the United Kingdom in Guayaquil, was abducted in the early hours of Saturday from a farm he owned and now his daughter has pleaded for his release

The daughter of a millionaire British businessman who has been abducted by gangsters in Ecuador has made a tearful plea for information.

Colin Armstrong, former honorary consul of the United Kingdom in Guayaquil, was abducted in the early hours of Saturday from a farm he owned, Ecuadorian police confirmed. A video said to show signs of forced entry, along with traces of blood and ransacked rooms, is understood to be circulating on social media.

According to local media in Ecuador, Colin was kidnapped at dawn on Saturday at a farm he owned in Baba in Los Rios province. As many as 15 men entered the property dressed as police officers and took him away, reports suggested. It was also reported that a Colombian woman, Katherine Paola Santos, who was believed to be Mr Armstrong's partner, was kidnapped at the same time. The honorary consul's car, a black BMW the kidnap victims are said to have been driven away in, has reportedly been found abandoned on the road between Baba and the nearby town of Salitre. One unconfirmed local report said the men who took the couple were wearing police uniforms.

Colin's daughter Diana Armstrong-Bruns told MailOnline from California: ""This is a critical time, we've been told not to say anything to anyone. We just want my father back."" His son Nick Armstrong, who helps run the family estate in the UK, has reportedly flown to help authorities with the search for his father who has not been seen or heard from since his abduction.

The pair are directors of the 500-acre Tupgill Park Estate near Leyburn in north Yorkshire, which has been the family home for more than 45 years. Colin is the founder and owner of Agripac, a large agricultural products company in Ecuador. He left the role of honorary consul in 2016 and was replaced by his sons. He was awarded an OBE and CMG in 2011.

Kidnappings for ransom have become increasingly common in Ecuador as surging violent crime has transformed the country from among the safest in Latin America to the most dangerous in just five years, according to a 2022 Gallup poll. An FCDO spokesperson said: ""We are in contact with the Ecuadorean authorities following the disappearance of a British man and are supporting his family.""

Countryfile viewers and host Adam Henson have been left in tears over the heartbreaking death of his beloved companion Peg, who previously featured on the BBC show

Countryfile have shared a sweet tribute to Adam Henson's loyal canine companion Peg after it was revealed the hardworking dog had died.

The BBC programme shared an image of Peg alongside an image of Adam with his fluffy friend with the caption: "" We are deeply saddened to share the news of the passing of Adam Henson's, loyal, and hardworking companion, Peg. Sending our condolences to our friend @adamhenson_.""

He replied with a green heart while viewers rushed to share their condolences with the Countryfile presenter. The farmer announced the news of Peg's passing earlier this week.

He uploaded a picture of himself holding Peg with the caption: ""It is with heavy heart that I've had to say goodbye to my hardworking, loving, loyal friend Peg."" Peg has featured in several episodes of Countryfile in the past during segments where Adam gives viewers an insight into his life as a farmer.



One saddened viewer commented: ""So sorry for you all to hear about Peg. A working dog but a much loved family pet first. Xxx."" Another wrote: ""So sorry to hear this. They are such a huge part of our lives and will leave a gaping hole.""

A third added: ""So sorry to hear Adam. Our thoughts go out to you,"" while a fourth wrote: ""I am so sorry for your loss. Peg is adorable and I know she was very loved."" Someone else shared: ""The Beautiful Peg. Will be sorely missed on Countryfile.""

Elsewhere on Countryfile, host Ellie Harrison quit the BBC show to focus on raising her son and two daughters after 13 years with the programme. ""After 13 years, my final column is a fond farewell to Countryfile - I'll miss the people, places and stories,"" she wrote in the latest issue of Countryfile Magazine.

""Thirteen-and-a-half years after I arrived four hours early for my first Countryfile shoot, which culminated in me commuting up Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon) to deliver Matt Baker a sandwich of freshly harvested mushrooms, it has come time for me to bid you farewell. ""It has been a decision I've drawn out, such is the bond with the programme, and boy will I miss the geography field trips.""

""I've come to realise that I don't need to navigate to a whole new ocean or even a new sea, but to chart a new course somewhere in these waters, raising my three wonderful children, growing our family business and following my own creative calling to produce art of my own making,"" she added.

Ellie lives in the Cotswolds with her GP husband Dr Matt Goodman and children Red, 13, Lux, 11, and a seven-year-old she has not publicly named.

""ŒThe 52-year-old man from the Russian city of Novosibirsk somehow survived being struck with the pitchfork in his skull, but is now in intensive care

""ŒA man had a pitchfork removed from his skull after he was attacked in a car park.

""ŒDoctors carried out emergency surgery on the 52-year-old in Russian city Novosibirsk after the ""attempted murder"". The man is miraculously alive but in a grave condition in intensive care.""Œ A graphic CCTV video shows the moment of the horrific attack following an ""argument"" between ""acquaintances"".

""ŒThe victim was evidently knocked to the ground and struck initially with a long-handled shovel. A third man pulls the attacker away but the aggressor grabs the four-pronged pitchfork from the back of a truck. Next he is seen repeatedly stabbing the sharp farming tool into his floored victim.

The man ""suffered multiple blows to vital organs"", say reports. He was rushed to hospital with the pitchfork embedded into his head. Initially in the operating theatre, rescuers aided medics by using an electric saw to cut each of the metal spikes from the pitchfork. Then surgeons set about removing the long spikes from the left inside the man's head as they battled to save his life. It is unclear how many of the prongs were embedded in his head.

""Rescuers responded to a special and unique case that required a high level of professionalism and pinpoint precision,"" said an official statement. ""The work was carried out in the operating room of one of the hospitals together with surgeons, where there was a victim who had a pitchfork go through his entire head. It was necessary to complete the task of cutting and separating the spikes of the tool.""

The attacker - so far unnamed - was detained by police soon after the violent incident, said law enforcement in Novosibirsk, Russia 's third-largest city and the unofficial capital of Siberia. A criminal case into attempted murder has been opened.

The Russian Investigative Committee said in a statement: ""A conflict broke out between male acquaintances. As a result, the accused struck the victim multiple times in the area of his vital organs. He failed to complete his intent to kill."" The victim ""was promptly provided with qualified assistance by the staff of a medical institution"". The motive for the pitchfork attack is so far unclear. The suspect is in a pretrial detention centre.

Walter Renwick, 68, claims he is being ""chucked out"" of Plankey Mill Farm, in Northumberland where he has lived all his life due to eviction by land owners, the Jesuits in Britain

A farmer, aged 68, has told how he is being ""chucked out"" of the home he has lived in all his life and has been in his family for three generations due to eviction.

Walter Renwick was born at Plankey Mill Farm, near Hexham, Northumberland and is a well-known face to visitors at the much-loved beauty spot where he runs a campsite.

But Walter has now been served with an eviction notice after battling the landowners to stay at the property.

The Jesuits in Britain, who own the land, say the original lease was legally held by Walter's father and after his death they extended the lease to allow Walter time to find a new home.

The church says the last lease extension ran out in 2021 and they have now been granted a court order to have Walter evicted, with bailiffs due to arrive on July 11.

Walter said: ""I have been here 68 years, it was in my father's name before I got it and his father's before I got it so we have been here quite a long time. It is a three generation farm.

""They are coming on July 11 to change all the household locks. If I'm in the house, I'm getting chucked out the house. I thought I had done everything right, paid everything off but they are determined they are going to sell the property.""

Walter said all his memories are from the area and the battle has broken him, reports ChronicleLive.

He said: ""It has broken a proud man. Years ago I feared nobody but now when there is a knock at my door, and it sounds pathetic, I'm out the back door and hiding in a barn like a stupid little kid and petrified.

""What has happened to me? I have stopped going to the shops now. I feel like I'm not right, I feel like what have they done that's not Walter, where is Walter.

""They have eaten away at my body, they have chip, chip, chipped. I mean some days I could just stay in bed and not get up and that is not me, I worked day and night on the farm. It is not because of my health because I can pace myself around my health.""

Walter said he can't put his head anywhere else, adding: ""I was born here. It is like a tree with roots.

""You know when your roots are here, everything has been put here: my dogs, my rabbits when I was a kid. Every memory I had as a kid, the football, the games when you were a kid when all the campers came. Happiness, there is no happiness now. Happiness is gone.

""I get up and do what I have to do. I haven't had a smile on my face for ages. What are they doing to me?""

A spokesman for The Jesuits in Britain reportedly said: ""The Jesuits in Britain can confirm that they have applied for a possession order on the Plankey Mill property, which is owned by them.

""This step has become necessary after repeated and fruitless attempts to persuade the son of the original leaseholder to leave the property fifteen years after his father's death.

""An original lease was held legally by this person's father, but like similar properties across the UK, there were no clauses in the lease for his children to inherit the rental contract when he died.

""Nevertheless, the Jesuits have agreed to several lease extensions totalling thirteen years up until April 2021, in order to give the illegal occupier time to find a new home.

""In addition, the Jesuits offered to financially remunerate him, to assist him in his move, if he left the property by November 2022. Since the last lease extension concluded in April 2021, this person has been in illegal possession of the property.

""Many of those denouncing the repossession have based their objections on the fact that the son of the leaseholder has been running a paid-for campsite on fields adjacent to the property.

""This campsite was never allowed under the terms of the lease, and did not have planning permission from the local authority. However, the Jesuits have never taken action on this point.

""Over a number of years, the Jesuits have received complaints from both the local council and the National Trust (who own an adjacent property) about the unsocial behaviour of several campers, especially during the pandemic in 2020.""

A spokeswoman for Northumberland County Council said they received a complaint in 2020 regarding an unauthorised campsite on Plankey Mill Farm.

She added: ""During the investigation, it was discovered that the campsite had been in operation for more than 10 years and is therefore immune from planning enforcement action.""

Farmer Rhys Williams described ""brutal"" weather conditions on Sunday when Jevon Hirst, 16, Harvey Owen, 17, Wilf Fitchett, 17, and Hugo Morris, 18, lost contact with their families in Garreg, Wales

A passing binman spotted the Ford Fiesta containing the bodies of four tragic teens nearly two days after they went missing, the Mirror has been told.

Farmer Rhys Williams lives at Garreg Hyll Drem Farm, just 25 metres from the spot where the four bodies were found at 10am yesterday morning. He and his wife Carys had been woken hours earlier by the sound of a search and rescue helicopter.

He told the Mirror: ""Early yesterday we heard the helicopter directly above us. It had the searchlight on. It was still dark. It was hovering and loud. I didn't think much of it. It moved on and came back later. They wouldn't have seen anything, no chance.""

Jevon Hirst, 16, Harvey Owen, 17, Wilf Fitchett, 17, and Hugo Morris, 18, who were all studying A-Levels at the same college, had gone to the picturesque area of Snowdonia to camp. The trip turned to tragedy after their silver Ford Fiesta plunged off a windy country road and overturned in a flooded ditch. They were reported missing by their worried families in Shrewsbury, Shropshire when they failed to return home on Monday.

Mr Williams described ""brutal"" weather conditions on Sunday when the youngsters lost contact with their families. It is not known when the fatal accident took place. Mr Williams said they were ""so unlucky"" to have left the road on a sharp bend, flipping their vehicle into a ditch that was flooded by two days of rain.

Carys later saw on Facebook that North Wales Police had issued an appeal for the missing teens. She was fighting back tears as Mr Williams said: ""They were found by the recycling lorry at 10 that morning. They were higher up, that's why they could see them. The binman told us they had phoned the police. It is only 25 metres around the corner from here. I could see the car but I didn't see anything else. They must have been going from Harlech north towards Snowdonia. This is one of two roads they could have taken. There are no tracks on the road, nothing to be seen. It's a sharp bend, it narrows. There were lots of leaves on that corner. There have been one or two accidents there before.""

The Fiesta was removed from the scene on Tuesday evening. But officers returned to search the area by torchlight on Wednesday morning. Mr Williams added: ""They were so unlucky, the way the car went in. It has gone into the ditch, low into the ditch. It's a small car. I went past and didn't see anything. Two buses would have gone past before 10am and not seen anything. They would have been there all Monday. You have got to be in a high vehicle to see anything and you have got to be looking, a passenger. The driver would have been looking at the road. The binman who saw it said that something caught his eye. He was on his phone and he looked over. You would struggle to see from a car.""

The bend where the car left the road is a point at which the mobile signal, patchy on some networks, can disappear. Mr Williams said: ""Some networks have no signal here. EE is good, but Vodafone is not good. On Sunday the water was high. It is brutal on Sunday. There's always a foot or two of water in the ditch but it can come up to six feet, the level of the car. It was bad on Friday and Saturday, the river had gone high quickly. But by Tuesday morning the level had come down. They were so unlucky. They could have hit a tree or a fence and gone in another way.""

The families are expected to identify their son's bodies in Bangor today. North Wales Police said in a statement yesterday that their deaths appear to have been a ""tragic accident."" The road remained closed on Wednesday afternoon when a specialist police underwater and marine search van arrived.

For the Princess of Wales, this hobby isn't just a real passion and an enjoyable way to spend her time - it has a bonus, as it's likely to have made her even more popular with her father-in-law, King Charles

The Princess of Wales is known to be seriously passionate about her hobbies - just look at how competitive she gets when undertaking sporting challenges with her husband Prince William during royal engagements.

From physical activity to photography: Kate has been seen to dedicate herself to her hobbies and really get stuck into them.

While one of them might not be as well known to be one of her favourite pastimes it is also likely to have had the bonus of helping her bond further with her father-in-law King Charles: gardening.

The King is known to be a passionate horticulturalist and has long advocated for organic farming methods, so it's safe to assume these two will have a lot to chat about whenever they spend time together.

A few years ago in 2019, Kate designed a garden for the Chelsea Flower Show and worked with Davies White Landscape Architects to bring her vision to life. According to the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), which runs the flower show, she designed to put ""families and childhood at the heart of its design.""

This is no surprise considering that Kate has called her work in early years development her ""life's work"". The RHS noted that the treehouse was the ""centrepiece"" of her garden, ""creating a place for children and families to play together. The waterfall and stream also encouraged play - from floating Poohsticks and chasing them along the stream to making dams with stones and sand to attract more wildlife.""

However, Kate also clearly shares her father-in-law's passion for the environment, because the design ""wasn't just for people either - the flowers, fruits, and seeds provided food for wildlife and nectar for bees and butterflies, while the plants offered nesting sites and shelter for birds and other animals.""

Earlier this year, a photo of Kate in full bee-keeping get-up was released, and she admitted back in 2021 that she had begun keeping bees and making her own honey. These pursuits are likely to have earned her some serious brownie points with King Charles, who has been dedicated for most of his adult life to raising awareness about environmentalism.

House and Garden have previously reported that the gardens at Highgrove - his Gloucestershire residence - have been his ""overriding passion"" and his ""pride and joy"". On select dates between April and September, they are even open to the public, so you can see for yourself the handiwork of our green-fingered monarch.

This section of the M62 in West Yorkshire may be surrounded by some of the country's most breathtaking scenery, but for residents just yards away it's a different story

If you thought spending two hours a day on your commute was bad, imagine living next door to it.

That's the reality for this household who live just 30 metres from one of the busiest motorways in the country.

Rakewood near Littleborough, Greater Manchester, is surrounded dramatic rolling hills which wouldn't look out of place in an episode of Last of the Summer Wine.

But for the 80-year-old man living at this house near to the M62 summit - which sees 144k vehicles a day passing by - life is not quite as peaceful and idyllic.

The elderly farmer told YorkshireLive that the stunning scenery is spoilt by the frequent roar of lorries and cars thundering past, with only a small space of garden separating him from the motorway which connects Liverpool and Manchester with Yorkshire.

""It was nice and peaceful,"" he said, declining to give his name.

But he added that the quiet of the countryside was a thing of the past since the major route was opened 50 years ago.

""You don't get used to the noise,"" he added.

""When it's wet it sounds like you're on the seafront and when it's summer we have to shut the windows because of the dust.""

When plans were announced to build the motorway in the early 1970s, the farmer said his family ""had no choice"" but to sell part of their land and outbuildings.

""It's like what's happened in a lot of places; they've done away with the countryside.""

Rakewood sits just a few miles from Stott Hall Farm - known more commonly by northern Brits as the ""house on the M62"" due to being ensconced between the two busy carriageways.

The house near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, has become one of the most iconic in the UK and for years was surrounded by myths that workers had to build the motorway around the house due to its stubborn owner's refusal to leave.

Instead, the slightly less novel reality is that a geological fault in the land beneath the farmhouse meant it was more practical to leave it be.

Another family who live on the opposite side of the motorway to the farm at Rakewood, said they moved out of the frying pan and into the fire in the 1960s, when they left their previous home at the site which has since become Manchester Airport.

Barrie and Gill Fulton thought they'd be getting away from the noise of planes taking off and landing when they jumped ship to Longden End in the nearby Pennines, only for the motorway to be built a decade later.

Now, the busiest road in the North is practically at the end of their garden.

""We try to ignore it,"" Mr Fulton said.

Despite the huge motorway just yards from the couple's door, their house suffers with terrible internet connection, with Mrs Fulton admitting, ""you can't watch Netflix "".

The M62 was started in 1960 before final parts were finished in 1976, and today sees around 144,000 vehicles every day, according to data from National Highways.

As well as one of the busiest, the stretch between West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester is also the highest elevated section of motorway in the country, with the M62 summit standing 372m above sea level.

Viewers of Coronation Street will be horrified in the new year when Evelyn and Cassie uncover the brutality of a puppy mill which the producers worked closely with the RSPCA to portray accurately

When Coronation Street's Evelyn and Cassie Plummer uncover an illegal puppy farm in the new year, what they find will horrify viewers.

And that is exactly the reaction the soap wants after developing the harrowing scenes with close guidance from the RSPCA to wake people up to the grim reality of the cruel trade.

Fans have already seen thug Terry threaten Evelyn, played by Maureen Lipman, and attack her grandson Tyrone after she confronted him for mistreating his puppy and rescued it. And in January, she and daughter Cassie (Claire Sweeney) will learn the villain runs a puppy farm at his home.

RSPCA inspector Herchy Boal, who helped retrieve more than 80 dogs from an illegal farm in the Midlands, advised scriptwriters on the distressing issue. Herchy says: ""Puppy farms are more common than people realise. They could have 90 breeding female dogs in one barn, in pens next to each other. They never see daylight, they never get any exercise or are walked and they are sometimes fed on automatic feeders, because they are not attended by human beings daily. All the dogs' poo is in there, too, because the pens aren't cleaned.""

Dog lover Maureen, 77, says: ""I hadn't realised these puppies are sold for £2,000 and these people are not registered"" Lucy's Law was passed three years ago to crack down on such cruel practices - yet illegal breeders still go to extraordinary lengths to con people.

Herchy warns that what look like normal homes are often fronts. Puppies bought more cheaply in Wales or Ireland are taken to rented, partially-furnished homes in England with a fake ""mother"" dog to be sold at a higher price.

Herchy warns: ""They will also say the puppies are fully vaccinated but they buy up vaccination cards and put fake stamps on. Breeders can also be pushy and say, ""˜It's the last one'. Always take a step back and use your intuition. If alarm bells are ringing, listen to them.""

Buyers can be so preoccupied with the pup they do not realise documents are fake until it is too late, she says. The animals can be in a terrible state, too, leading to huge vet bills. ""Many have fleas and worms,"" says Herchy. ""A lot will have parvovirus, as they are not vaccinated. It causes them to vomit, have diarrhoea and a huge amount of blood loss.""

And removed from mothers too soon and not fed properly, farmed puppies often sadly die. Recalling someone buying a West Highland terrier from a puppy farm, Herchy, with the RSPCA 23 years, says: ""Her pup died within an hour of buying it. I also knew of a 13-year-old girl who came downstairs to find the puppy had died in its basket. And I have known detectives, doctors, nurses and even a judge who have been completely conned. These are genuine stories of heartbreak.""

While Herchy loves her job, she says it can be tough. ""One puppy farmer threatened me. I had to change my working day and route home,"" she says. And she praises the ITV soap for tackling the issue, saying: ""Maureen and Claire wanted to get it right.

""They were very thoughtful of the whole process and everyone at Corrie showed how much they cared. That meant a lot to us at the RSPCA. This is a story that affects so many.""

Don't get conned

To identify fake adverts for puppies, the RSPCA advises googling phone numbers and descriptions to see if they appear in other ads. Words like ""miniature"" and ""teacup"" can be dealers capitalising on popular terms. Right-click on photos and select ""search Google for image"" to see if they have been used elsewhere.

If an advert says a puppy has been vaccinated, check how old he or she is, as this isn't allowed before four weeks. And be aware that a puppy advertised as having a passport has most probably been imported. And promises of ""free insurance"" and ""puppy packs"" don't mean the advert is from a legitimate breeder.

Lucy's Law

Since Lucy's Law was passed in 2020, anyone wanting a new puppy in England must buy from a breeder or adopt from a rescue centre. The law was named after Lucy, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel rescued from terrible conditions at a South Wales puppy farm in 2013.

Licensed dog breeders must show puppies interacting with their mothers in their place of birth. Selling without a licence can lead to an unlimited fine or six months' jail.

Love Island's Will and Jessie have made a big decision about where they will base themselves in the future after falling in love on the ITV2 show

Love Island couple Will Young and Jessie Wynter have made a big decision about their future after their exit.

The pair met on this year's series of Winter Love Island, but with Jessie being from Australia and Will from the UK, it meant the pair had a bigger decision than most to make about how they'd carry on their relationship out the villa.

Will and Jessie have now decided how they plan to continue their romance, and where they will settle for the foreseeable future, with the farmer keen to show his new girlfriend around his family farm, and his workplace.

Asked what's next for them, she said: ""I'm heading to Will's farm for the interim! I'm very excited to go there. I'll be looking to move to London. Samie and I were going to look at apartments so we'll see how all of that goes.""

Will echoed Jessie's sentiment and revealed he'd be keen to visit Australia too.

""The first plan is for Jessie to come to the farm and help me with lambing and then I think for us, it's about just taking every day as it comes,"" he revealed of the pair's future plans - before opening up about a possible trip to Australia.

He said: ""I think it's very fair to say I would go to Australia. A relationship is a two-way thing. It would be unfair for me to rely on Jessie moving here 100%. Australia has always been a place I'd like to go to and travel.""

The pair met one another's families during their last day in the villa.

""They said you can really see that we're suited and that we do love each other. So basically, get Jessie ready to get on the farm!"" Will said, before adding: ""Getting to see her sister and mum was a very special surprise. I think her mum is very, very sweet, a very sweet woman. I think me and her sister will get on very well. Our personalities are very similar.""

Jessie said being with her family was the best thing, and their families might never have met without that trip to South Africa.

She said: ""My family are my world. That was one of the best moments in the Villa. If it wasn't for them flying to South Africa I don't think my mum would have been able to meet Will's dad, so that's obviously an incredible experience. My dad had to stay home and look after my sister. They've never left Australia so that was huge to me.""

United States Coast Guard crews had removed 3,000 gallons of the oil and water mixture from the spill in Port Manatee, Florida, on Saturday after already removing 4,500 over the course of the night before

A huge spill has left thousands of gallons of oil in waters hit by Hurricane Idalia.

Officials in Florida are trying to determine who is the ""responsible party"" for a massive crude oil spill that left thousands of gallons of oil and water mixture in an area still dealing with the negative impacts of Hurricane Idalia.

According to the United States Seventh Coast Guard District, crews had removed 3,000 gallons of the oil and water mixture from the Friday afternoon spill in Port Manatee on Saturday. They were still continuing their efforts into Sunday, the agency said on their X - formerly Twitter - page.

""The source and responsible party are under investigation,"" the USCG Southeast said in a statement Sunday on the social media platform.

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US

The post comes as the agency has been sharing updates of the clean-up efforts for the massive crude oil spill that was first reported on Friday.

On Saturday, the agency shared that ""about 4,500 gals of oil/water mixture was removed from overnight efforts,"" adding that there did not appear to be any new oil on the scene as of Saturday morning.

Initially, USCG Southeast received a National Response Center report about the oil spill and rushed to the scene. They used approximately 1400 ft of boom in efforts to contain the initial spill.

Photos from the scene show black muck and debris consuming the port as crews can be seen rushing to best tackle the disastrous mess. Tubing in the water appears to be blocking off part of the oil from getting to other areas.

While it is currently unknown how much crude oil made its way into the waters, authorities have already retrieved around 7,500 gallons of oil/water mixture

Port Manatee sits in the northern part of Manatee County, an area still reeling from the impacts of Hurricane Idalia. Over the weekend, the Florida Department of Health of Manatee County issued a swim advisory for residents in an effort to stop them from going to beaches due to potential effects on water quality.

Residents were told to avoid contact with floodwaters that came from overflowing rivers, lakes or oceans as they may contain feacal matter from sewage systems and septic tanks, WFLA reports. Agricultural and industrial waste, debris, downed power lines and other hazards have been listed as being in the waters as well.

Officials are conducting tests on to determine water quality at beaches, but those are expected to resume on September 5 as it is the Labor Day holiday weekend in the United States.

Beachgoers should assume that the water may pose an increased risk of disease or illness, however, and steer clear of the waters over the long weekend.

The victims, aged between 19 and 22, have been named as Nayeli Tapia, Denisse Reyna, and Yuliana Macias, who travelled from their homes in in Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas, Ecuador, for a beach day

Three missing young women have been found with their throats slit and signs of torture in a shallow grave.

The grim find was made by some fishermen who noticed a dog sniffing the ground alongside the Esmeraldas River near Quininde, Ecuador, on April 7 and smelt a foul stench.

Police officers were called to the scene, where they uncovered the bodies of three young women.

They were tied up and their mouths were covered, media in Esmeraldas Province reported.

Diego Velastegui of the Quininde Police told local press: ""They were young, had beach clothes, bathing suits, light clothing, shorts.""

The victims, aged between 19 and 22, have been named as Nayeli Tapia, Denisse Reyna, and Yuliana Macias.

They had left their homes in Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas, some 84 kilometres (52 miles) away from where they were found, on April 4 to go to the beach.

Their families reported them missing later that day.

Crime scene investigators say the women were tortured and had their throats slit.

The victims' families have said that they do not know the friends they were supposed to meet.

Preliminary investigations suggest that the women were killed in the rural locality of Malimpia, in Quininde Parish, on April 5.

Investigators have reportedly identified the rental car that allegedly took the young women to the crime scene.

Yuliana's aunt, Paulina Rueda, told local media: ""All we want is justice, and if the public knows, they should report who is responsible for this horrible femicide, because it's three femicides in one day.""

In addition to the bodies, police officers found a mobile phone, which they hope will help them solve the case.

Victim Nayeli, 22, grew up in Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas but lived in Quito. She worked as a model.

Yuliana, 21, was a singing student and performed with the band Las Diablitas.

Denisse, 19, was studying Agricultural Engineering at the State Technical University of Quevedo.

Grieving Paulina told local media that she and other relatives have been receiving threats for demanding justice.

She said: ""I will stand until the last consequences, despite the fact that my life has been in danger since yesterday.""

She has pleaded with the public to not link the young women's deaths to drug trafficking.

The victims were laid to rest on April 9.

The Mirror has spoken to three experts about the link between climate change and the current wildfires in the Mediterranean - and which 'closer to home' places could be at risk in future

Wildfires are likely to blight a host of 'unexpected' countries in the coming years thanks to climate change, according to experts.

Rhodes and Corfu in Greece are bracing for another 48 hours of infernos which have already ravaged homes and businesses, including holiday resorts, with thousands of Brits among those forced to flee.

The root cause is suspected to be arson but the increased intensity of heatwaves in the Mediterranean thanks to global warming has increased the ferocity and spread considerably. Greece has experienced some of the hottest prolonged temperatures in recent days for 50 years, with up to another two weeks peaking at above 40C on the cards.

The past fortnight has also seen extreme heat in southern Europe, as well as the US and north Africa. Italy has already been hit with its third heatwave of the summer, while temperatures spiked in Spain over the weekend.

Multiple experts have told the Mirror the likelihood of wildfires increasing in already fire prone countries will continue until net zero is reached - possibly by 2060.

Dr Thomas Smith, Associate Professor in Environmental Geography, London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), said: ""As far as I'm concerned, the risk can only increase until temperatures stabilise because the link between temperatures and fire behaviour is very well established - so unfortunately we know where we're heading for the next few decades.

""Every year now we are seeing some part of the Mediterranean where holidaymakers like to go on holiday, experiencing wildfires. There were fires in Turkey a couple of years ago, Greece again, Spain, the Spanish Islands, Canary Islands, they are all at risk. Sicily and Sardinia are particularly at risk right now. It is inevitable.""

He said in the coming decades studies ""point to a far higher frequency of these extreme risk days"" that might currently be ""only once every four years or so but by the middle of this century might be happening frequent times a year"".

Dr Douglas Kelley, a land surface modeller at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, added: ""We're projecting 14% increase by 2030, and that will go up to 30% by the middle of the decade, so twice as many and 50% by 2100 or maybe even more. And this is primarily due to climate change, these increases in wildfires.

He added: ""We're getting to the point where we're getting fires we haven't experienced before. It's the intensity and speed of these fires which are really unusual. They are much more intense and much faster spreading than we expect and that's what's different this year.""

Areas that are not so prone to such phenomena - and much closer to home for Brits - are becoming increasingly more common in recent years.

Prof Stefan Doerr, Director of the Centre for Wildfire Research, Swansea University, said: ""What we are seeing now, especially since 2018, is more extensive wildfires in areas of Europe where they have been historically very unusual.

""For example, northern France, western Poland and eastern Germany have been hit by really extreme fires. Some of the fire services were out of their depth, they were not expecting any of this because at least in the generation they had trained, they hadn't experienced anything like this.

""The same happened in 2018 in Sweden, and the UK with the Saddleworth Moor wildfires where the army got involved to fight the fire.

""Again in London and other parts of England last summer where we had 90 properties destroyed fuelled largely by crop fires. This is not something we're used to. So, yes, the fires are moving into areas, where in casual terms you could say they do not belong or at least into environments that are not naturally adapted to fire.""

Dr Kelley said his colleagues' projections show drier conditions in the coming years for parts of France, Spain, Portugal, Germany and Poland, on top of continued such conditions throughout the Med and Eastern Europe - all of which will fuel wildfires.

Asked about the likelihood of blazes of such intensity in the UK, Dr Smith said we experienced the ""consequences"" of record breaking temperatures, combined with ignition last year in London.

But added that he didn't think it would get to the ""same scale"" as seen in the Med, for example. ""The UK is so developed and we have such densely populated areas and our countryside is criss-crossed by roads and infrastructure and that can prevent the spread of fires becoming too large,"" he said.

""It may not be the case for Scotland though where there is some continuity fuels, and we've started to see some very large fires in Scotland. There was one earlier this year that was about the size of Zone 1 in London (~3,500 hectares).

""That was of a similar scale as the one we've seen on Rhodes, albeit it's Scotland with a different fuel type, heather moorlands. I think in England and the forests of the UK, at the moment I can't see us having quite as severe fire as in Rhodes because of this discontinuity in the fuels.

""But in terms of the disruption that a fire might cause I think we do have the potential for a smaller fire to have a similar kind of impact because of the fact we have so many places on the boundary between urban areas and rural areas.

""We call this the rural-urban interface, the wild land interface, meaning we have potential for quite disruptive fires, even if they are quite small.""

The wildfire in Rhodes started last Tuesday in the forests and hilly regions on the island. Dr Smith said the fire began spreading ""according to the terrain"", so it quickly spread uphill and then slower down the downslopes. He added: ""It was radiating in a circle, so it wasn't moving in a particular direction."" This wasn't entirely unusual.

He continued: ""It is a common misconception that climate change can't have played any part at all if the fire was started by arson. It's what drives the fire, it doesn't matter what started it.""

Changes to the climate mean flammable fuel is dried out and allows the flames to ignite quickly. ""When you have a very long dry period like they're experiencing in the Mediterranean and a heatwave of very high temperatures and low relative humidity, it's not just the fine fuels that dry out but the coarser fuels as well,"" he said.

Examples of fine fuels would be pine needles on the ground but coarser fuels includes the deadwood from old trees. Dr Smith said another issue, particularly in Greece, is how many young forests they have in the core of the islands. And this may be linked to tourism.

Many of these are the sites of old agricultural land, which is no longer used for farming, meaning trees are growing. He said: ""Young forests means that the trees are not particularly tall and that contributes to the fire risk because there's a connectivity between the surface, which is normally where a fire starts, and the crowns of the trees, the tops of the trees. That's important.""

He said such land abandonment is perhaps caused by the tourism industry becoming ""far more important economically"", leading to generations of farmers moving away from the sector to the coasts and seek a living nearer the beaches.

Prof Doerr reiterated that re-vegetation of abandoned areas ""makes the landscape much more flammable"" and can be reduced to a certain degree by better management.

This can include increased fire awareness amongst the population and those visiting to minimise ignitions, as well as practical measures like reducing the connectivity of the flammable vegetation. ""It's generating fire breaks, this is nothing new, you see this across the Med, there is a break in the forest in the landscape designed to stop those fires,"" he said.

""However, under those extreme winds they are almost ineffective because you have these embers blown from the fire, sometimes for kilometres, igniting new fires. In less windy conditions, however, they can be really effective.""

In fact, he said the wind is key to stopping the current wildfires in Greece. ""What you need due to the windy conditions would be a very wide break in flammable material to stop the fires because of these embers that are being blown by the wind.

""What typically happens in very large fires once they are over a certain size and the wind stays strong is you simply have to wait for a change in weather.

""Whilst all those firefighters on the ground, the helicopters and plane pilots who are risking their lives, can often be very effective in protecting small areas, properties, or perhaps stopping the fires in a very limited area, but there is no way to put out a forest fire completely under extreme burning conditions just doesn't happen.""

Roman Piekarski, 71 and Maz Piekarski, 69, have spent five decades sourcing their amazing pendulum-driven machines, on display at their Cuckooland museum. This time of year they are kept busy as it takes the pair more than a day to ensure the clocks are accurately telling the right time when daylight saving regulations kick in twice each year. The unmarried siblings' remarkable hoard all come from a 25-mile area in the Black Forest, Germany, where the vintage timepieces were first manufactured. Visitors come from across the world to see the museum, in Tabley, near Knutsford, Cheshire, and are often ""˜gobsmacked' by what they find.

Roman said: ""We love what we do. Cuckoo clocks have been a way of life for us. We work every day - Christmas is just another day. We've been to Germany and different countries to buy clocks. We have had to hunt them down and when you find them it's great. When people leave us, they are absolutely gobsmacked. People just can't believe what we've managed to put together. I have a joke - ""˜Never mind the Great Wall of China, we have the Great Wall of cuckoo clocks'. In our 35-year history, we have never had a disappointed visitor.""

Among their revered collection is possibly the world's most famous cuckoo clock, which was made for Frederick I, the Grand Duke of Barden, in the 1860s. The clocks are set to go back on Sunday, October 29, marking the start of earlier sunsets and days getting shorter and the end of BST and means we get an extra hour in bed on Sunday morning.

The clock change will always happen at 1am on the last Sunday of the month so there is as little disruption as possible.The change came into play in 1916, as it was introduced to give farmers an extra hour of sunlight to work and help boost the agricultural sector during the First World War. However, people have argued it is outdated and that the UK is much less reliant on the farming economy compared to when it was put in place.

American scientist Benjamin Franklin had first proposed the idea in 1784. He believed that if people got up earlier in the morning, when it was lighter, it would save them having to use so many candles. However, the idea wasn't taken seriously until 1907, when builder William Willett published a pamphlet titled The Waste of Daylight. Willett, who is actually Coldplay Singer Chris Martin's great-great-grandfather, suggested putting the clocks forward in the spring, and back in the autumn.

Brits that enjoy a home renovation project might be keen on a property in Wales that could be one of the cheapest houses in the UK. The two-bed house costs just £40,000

The UK's ""cheapest home"" set in a scenic village has been left to rot and is now on sale for a relatively small sum.

The stone-fronted property in Snowdonia in North Wales is on sale for £40,000 but needs to major work to create a homely feel.

The two-bedroomed house is in the village of Trawsfynydd. The listing can be viewed on Rightmove and will go on sale with All Wales Auction next month.

It appears some renovation work has been completed at the property, as pictures of the interior showed the house stripped bare.

Savvy fixer-uppers will note that work will need to be done on both of the bedrooms, a rear yard and outbuilding, a sitting room and a former kitchen area.

Visit Snowdonia lists the tiny village of Trawsfynydd as an area that is a ""well-located walking and cycling base close to mountains and the trails in the Coed y Brenin Forest Park"", the Daily Post reported.

Close to the man-made reservoir Llyn Trawsfynydd, the tourist site also said the area is a ""popular activity and adventure spot with excellent fishing for trout and game species, walking, birdwatching, canoeing, kayaking, and a new cycle loop, boat jetty and visitor centre with cafÃ©"".

Nearby sites also include a hostel, and heritage centre that give glimpses into Trawsfynydd's past, including the farmhouse home of poet Hedd Wyn.

Wyn, born Ellis Humphrey Evans, died on the first day of the brutal Battle of Passchendaele during World War I.

His life sparked a Welsh language film named after his bardic name Hedd Wyn, released in 1992.

The anti-war film became the first film spoken in Welsh to be nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best International Feature Film.

Visit Wales said: ""The location is peaceful, set in a landscape of moving grandeur and beauty, offering opportunities for peaceful reflection - a place of tranquility...

""The history and symbolism that the place represents reflects a period of social, cultural and agricultural history at the turn of the 20th century.

""Hedd Wyn's life and death are representative of an entire generation of young men from Wales, Britain and Europe, who gave the ultimate sacrifice during the First World War.""

Countryfile viewers found the BBC show ""hard to concentrate"" on as they took to social media to comment on one presenter's attire

Countryfile viewers couldn't help but comment on weather presenter Ben Rich's outfit as he shared an update on the predicted rainfall for the week ahead.

Host Adam Henson handed over to Ben after spending the episode sharing his experience of lambing season.

Ben began: ""For some of us this weekend has brought some warmth to the end of April, which temperature-wise has been pretty much average overall.""

However, viewers found it ""hard to concentrate"" on the weather due to Ben's red checked shirt, which he paired with dark blue jeans and a black belt.

One BBC viewer praised: ""The great Ben Rich going the full check shirt, buttons undone, jeans loses a point for not rolling up the sleeves but a fine showing. #countryfile #CasualWeatherperson.""

""'BBC weather bod, you're covering #countryfile. Make sure you dress like you're going line dancing afterwards,'"" another tweeted.

A third added: ""It's hard to concentrate on the weather charts #Countryfile,"" while a fourth noted: ""Ben Rich superb attire...its a yes from me and through to the next round!#countryfile.""

Another wrote: ""Check shirt. All is good with the world again. #countryfile,"" and someone else said: ""The contrasting bright buttons really works too, not just a check shirt, but a nice check shirt #CountryFile.""

In Sunday's lambing special, Charlotte Smith visited a farm in the Outer Hebrides during lambing season while Paralympic athlete Sammi Kinghorn visited her family farm in the Scottish borders.

The Paralympian opened up on the accident that caused her paralysis, which took place on the family farm while reflecting on her childhood and her love for animals.

Elsewhere, Countryfile viewers were shown how wool fleeces may be the secret ingredient to creating the UK's next great wine.

Last week, the BBC show aired a royal special episode which focussed on King Charles' love for the countryside ahead of his Coronation.

Charlotte met with Elizabeth Buchanan, the former King's advisor on agriculture worked as his private secretary from 2005 to 2008.

Elizabeth admitted: ""It was the hardest, most demanding job I have ever done in my life because he works so hard, up until 10 it's papers, papers, papers, 10 it kicks off publicly. Then it's dinner and after that, he's back at his desk...it's constant work and all of it is for other people.""

Storm Agnes is making landfall in the UK with a warning of winds up to 80mph and torrential rain after battering Ireland with a roof blown off a house and trees uprooted

Key Events

Forecasters have warned the ""worst conditions are still to come"", with Storm Agnes making landfall in the UK after battering the south of Ireland with gale force winds.

Agnes, the first named storm of the season, has triggered a series of Met Office yellow weather warnings for wind and rain, with forecasts of damaging winds and big stormy seas.

Gusts of up to 70mph had already been recorded in south-west Ireland, with the storm set to hit areas of northern England and Scotland later on Wednesday. The roof of a building in Youghal, Co Cork, was blown off.

Met Office meteorologist Marco Petagna said: ""This evening's rush hour could be quite tricky"" in some north and north-western areas of the UK, as it is expected to coincide with expected periods of strong wind and rain. ""

He added: ""Some of the worst conditions are still to come. The rain warnings are out to cover through the evening and the wind warnings are into the overnight period. We are looking at high gusts developing."" Gusts of 53mph were recorded in the Isles of Scilly on Wednesday and ""well into the 40mph (zone)"" across parts of Cornwall and parts of Wales, but ""the winds are picking up"", Mr Petagna said.

The alerts include a wind warning until 7am on Thursday stretching across Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, as well as the south-west of England, the West Midlands and most of the north of England. There are also rain warnings for much of Scotland through to Thursday at 3am.

The Met Office said: ""Whilst there is still some uncertainty in the exact track and depth of Agnes, gusts of 45-55 mph are expected widely inland and 50-60 mph over hills and around coasts.

""The strongest winds are expected to affect eastern parts of Northern Ireland, southwest Scotland, west and northwest Wales, Cumbria and Lancashire where some inland locations may see gusts of 50 to 60 mph, and perhaps 65-75 mph over hills and around some coasts. The strongest gusts are most likely during the second half of Wednesday afternoon and through the evening.""

RNLI issues advice as coastlines will be worst hit by Storm Agnes

The storm is likely to cause “dangerous conditions” on the coasts around the UK and Ireland, according to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).

They advised staying a “safe distance” away from the water and cliff edges to avoid being knocked over or washed into the sea.

Sam Hughes, an RNLI water safety partner, said: “It is not worth risking your life. If you see someone else in danger in the water, call 999 or 112 and ask for the Coastguard. If you have something that floats that they can hold on to, throw it to them. Don’t go in the water yourself – you may end up in difficulty too.”

When will Storm Agnes move from Ireland across Northern Ireland?

Storm Agnes will batter Northern Ireland by lunchtime, it is understood.

When will gusts be at their heaviest across the UK?

Wind speeds will reach peaks - of up to 75mph - across the UK by late afternoon today, forecasters say.

Storm Agnes will be at its most intense by around 3pm or 4pm after moving slowly across Ireland. Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said in a YouTube video wind speeds in North Wales, for example, should peak at 72mph by 4pm.

Gusts will strengthen throughout the day and, after the peak, conditions will become calmer tonight.

Met Office says yellow weather warning could become an amber one

The yellow weather warning in place for most of the country for wind could be escalated to an amber one, Met Office said.

Amber warnings are rarer, and only used when there is an increased likelihood of impacts from severe weather, such as the possibility of travel delays, road and rail closures, power cuts and the potential risk to life and property.

In which case, the says you should think about changing your plans and taking action to protect yourself and your property.

Speaking on a YouTube video, Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said: ""Many places are in for a very windy end to the day on Wednesday and start to the day on Thursday.

""At the time of recording, we have a yellow weather warning out. It is not out of the question... that we may need to escalate to an amber. I'm not expecting us to need to but it is not out of the question.""

The areas most at risk of the change include those on the Irish Sea coastline, such as parts of North Wales, Lancashire, Cumbria and Merseyside - highlighted in purple on the map below.

Pickton had killed 49 women and disposed of their remains in the most gruesome manner - by feeding them to the herds of pigs he kept on his farm. He even ground some of the human flesh into mince, mixed it with pork, and sold it to meat processing businesses, family members, friends, and even the local police.

He had lured the women who mostly worked as sex workers in Vancouver's Red Light district to his home where he imprisoned them, tortured and then murdered them. Their bodies were then either fed to his pigs or put through an industrial meat grinder.

When the police finally arrived Pickton's pigs had foraged so furiously on the victims that there was nothing left of them. He was only caught after a search of his property revealed an asthma inhaler belonging to one of his victims. But he refused to co-operate with police and as a result an undercover Mountie posed as a cellmate - as they spoke Pickton began to brag about his crimes.

For years rumours had circulated about strange comings and goings at his pig farm but it was dismissed by local police - many of whom bought meat from him - as drunken gossip. The reality was the wealthy pig farmer mainly preyed upon drug addicts and prostitutes, picking them up in Vancouver's red light district before driving them to his farm, where he had sex with them before murdering them in a variety of horrific ways.

He allegedly handcuffed and stabbed other victims, including one woman who managed to escape, naked and bleeding, in 1997 after stabbing Pickton with his own knife. At the time the woman was considered an unreliable witness by police and Pickton was not prosecuted.

The clothes and rubber boots Pickton had been wearing that evening were seized by police and left in an police storage locker for more than seven years. Not until 2004 did lab testing show that the DNA of two missing women was on the items seized from Pickton in 1997

When he was finally arrested in February 2002, it was almost by chance. Investigators had raided his pig farm looking for illicit weapons, only to find items belonging to long-missing women. A search of Pickton's farm revealed DNA evidence of 26 missing women, mostly of indigenous origin, and he was charged with their murders.

No-one had known the eccentric scruffy farmer was one of the deadliest serial killers in history. In a documentary crime author Wensley Clarkson said: ""Robert Pickton was a serial killer who made the Texas Chainsaw Massacre look like an attraction at Disneyland.

""There was nothing about him which made him standout, he didn't have great personal hygiene and he would hold barn dances with bikers and women and alcohol. He was known locally for using prostitutes and had a perchant for indigenous women but when large numbers went missing no one made the connnection.""

Christopher Berry Dee, criminology, ""Rumours circulated but no-one took it seriously. ""It's a ghostly place to go at night and you wouldn't go there on your own."" A depraved loner who did not have the skills for normal social interaction he often arranged barn dances at his farm and invite local bikers and women to come.

He held notorious drunken raves in a barn on his property dubbed ""˜The Piggy Palace', where prostitutes would entertain revellers. It is thought that some women went missing after attending his parties but no-one alerted the authorities. He even had a friend who lived on the farm with him who knew he'd killed at least one woman but was blackmailing him for money to buy her silence.

In a police interview he was asked which girls had come to his farm and he said he could not remember and did not show any emotion. Investigating officers were certain Pickton had killed dozens of women but without physical evidence needed a confession so planted an officer in prison. Pickton began to confess to his cell mate and talked in a bragging way.

The Mountie used the same slang and language to show Pickton they were similar and get him to open up. He eventually bragged about how he disposed on the women during a discussion about the best way to get rid of a body. During Pickton's trial, forensic staff said that about 80 unidentified DNA profiles, roughly half male and half female, had been detected on evidence.

The items police found inside Pickton's trailer included a loaded .22 revolver with a dildo over the barrel and one round fired, boxes of Magnum handgun ammunition, night vision goggles, two pairs of faux fur-lined handcuffs, a syringe with three millilitres of blue liquid inside, and a liquid aphrodisiac called Spanish Fly.

The court was also played a videotape of one of Pickton's friends saying he had told him a good way to kill a female heroin addict was to inject her with car screen wash. A second clip showed another friend saying Pickton mentioned killing prostitutes by handcuffing and strangling them, then bleeding and gutting them before feeding them to pigs.

In 2007 a court found him guilty pf six counts of first degree murders, there was a enough evidence to charge him with 20 more but prosecutors decided not to because he had already been given life sentences. But it has never been satisfactory proven how many he really did kill only that his evil might not have stopped had he not been caught.

Christopher Berry Dee said: ""These women to Pickton were nothing more than meat, he would use it abuse it and recycle it and put it back into the community, the man is an animal."" In 2016 he released a book written in prison which was described as ""rambling"" and ""interspersed with passages from the Bible,"". The book claims that Pickton was set up by investigators without offering any hint at who might have killed the 26 women or why their DNA was found at the farm.

The PlayStation State of Play is set to include news about PSVR2, Indie, and third-party titles

Sony has confirmed that a PlayStation State of Play event will be taking place later tonight and will focus on indies and third-party titles.

Not content with letting Nintendo hold the September 14, 2023 announcement window with its Nintendo Direct September 2023 presentation, Sony has announced that a PlayStation State of Play will be taking place seven hours after the Nintendo Direct premieres. The PlayStation event was announced via a post on the PlayStation Blog earlier this week and is set to feature upcoming PS4, PS5, and PSVR2 titles.

It's not entirely unprecedented for Sony and Nintendo to hold events on the same day, this time last year the same thing happened as a Nintendo Direct and PlayStation State of Play took place on September 13, 2022. Sony undoubtedly had the better showing that time with the likes of Tekken 8 and Like a Dragon Ishin (that was the Nintendo Direct with five farming games for those who remember), so let's see if they can outshine Nintendo once more.

PlayStation State of Play September 2023 start time and how to watch

The PlayStation State of Play for September 2023 will begin at 10pm BST / 5pm EDT / 2pm PDT on Thursday, September 14. While Sony hasn't provided an official runtime for the event, previous PlayStation State of Play showcases have lasted 20-30 minutes (barring any special ones like the extended look at Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League in the February 2023 State of Play).

The event will be streamed on PlayStation's YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok accounts. All three streams will go live at the same time so it's really down to which platform you prefer.

You'll also be able to watch the event after it's been streamed, so if you can't be bothered watching everything you can skip through the highlights afterwards.

What to expect from PlayStation State of Play September 2023

All PlayStation has said about the presentation is that it ""will focus on updates to previously announced games coming to PlayStation consoles. From indie and PS VR2 highlights to major upcoming titles from our third-party partners"". Unlike the Nintendo Direct, there are no leaks, so everything from here on out is just guesswork based on that statement.

One title we're sure will show up is Tekken 8. Based on the leaked character roster, there are still a few faces left to reveal before the game releases on January 26, 2024, we could maybe even get a proper trailer for the game's story mode. In terms of other fighting games, both Street Fighter 6 and Mortal Kombat 1 have both had trailers recently so we wouldn't expect anything major from those.

Considering the last time we saw Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was at the February 2022 State of Play before it was delayed for nine months, perhaps it could be time for Gotham's finest to rear their heads once more.

Crawley's selection should not be questioned; he bats for the team and felt the bowlers were tying England down and asserted his authority, setting the tone for the flow of runs that followed

In a recent team huddle, Zak Crawley piped up with a yarn about a Chinese farmer. Obviously.

Apparently, this Chinese farmer lived his life by a Far Eastern proverb that, according to the listening Ben Stokes, went something like this. ""We don't know why things happen, if it's for good or not.""

Fair enough. But the same Chinese farmer has probably got a proverb more relevant to laid-back Zak. ""He who dances halfway down the track had better hit it.""

The collective Lord's groan when Crawley's dreamy cameo at the start of the England batting effort came to a stumped, ignominious end was a familiar sound to the opener's ears. Crawley is 66 innings into his Test career and it is already hard to think of a more frustrating English player.

No-one purposely gets out but when it comes to gifting wickets, few have been as generous as Crawley. Make no mistake, his run-a-ball 48 at Lord's helped set the platform for what could still be a very decent England total.

But, at the Home of Cricket on a good batting track under a bright sky, this should have been a statement knock from a supremely talented batsman. And for all the faith shown in him by the Bazball hierarchy, Crawley's statement knocks are few and far between.

In those 66 innings, Crawley has hit only three centuries - two against Pakistan and one against the West Indies - and averages 28.75.

For a player with his gifts, that is almost criminally low. At times, it all seems to come too easily to Crawley ""¦ and that is not a reference to his old man being minted.

Terry Crawley was once reported to have made £23million in a single year as a City of London stock market trader and sent his son to the ultra-posh Tonbridge School, where the fees set you back £13,000 a term.

Cricket-wise, dad's investment paid off and as he swatted Australia's pacemen around Lord's, it was hard to believe some people still question the wisdom of Crawley's selection.

It should not be questioned. Crawley bats for the team, bats for the ethos. He felt the bowlers were tying England down and asserted his authority, setting the tone for the flow of runs that followed.

He was born to be a Bazballer, hitting the first Australian delivery of this Ashes series to the boundary. Almost bizarrely, ahead of this Test match, Crawley said: ""I think we will win by - I don't know - 150 runs.""

It is highly unlikely Crawley will be proven correct but you have to admire his bullishness, with bat and words.

And after the heavy criticism of much of their first-day performance, this spirited second-day riposte was led by the relatively new English wave. Josh Tongue removed Steve Smith, adding him to Usman Khawaja and David Warner for an impressive opening collection of Ashes wickets as England took the remaining five Australian wickets for a hundred.

And when Alex Carey completed the formalities after Crawley skipped a few steps and missed Nathan Lyon's sharp turner, Ollie Pope and Ben Duckett took up the cudgels. Pope's dismissal, hooking Cameron Green into Steve Smith's hands, seemed as rash as Crawley's but, quite simply, this is the way these guys play.

As Duckett and Joe Root were both out to erroneous pull shots, there was a torrent of social media comments about ""˜brainless' England. But you can't laud attacking intent and then cry when it costs a wicket or four.

Some people seem to want their Test Match Special cake and eat it. Pope backed himself to hit it into the stands, just as Crawley backed himself to take on Lyon.

Even for a Chinese farmer, that must be frustrating ""¦ but at least it is thrilling to watch.

Research from the Common Wealth think-tank found Britain's privatised energy network has handed £28 billion since it was sold off by the Tories in 1990

National Grid has paid out billions to shareholders while being slow to upgrade its network to fully harness renewable energy, a new report has claimed.

Research from the Common Wealth think-tank found Britain's privatised energy network has handed £28 billion since it was sold off by the Tories in 1990. But it still takes an average of 13 years to connect renewable projects like wind farms to the grid.

And when wind farms create more energy than the grid can handle, National Grid pay them to shut down - at an eye-watering cost of up to £62 million a day. The researchers argue renationalising the grid would save the nation billions - allowing the government to use the money that would have been handed to shareholders to invest in infrastructure.

Adrienne Buller, Director of Research at Common Wealth, said: ""The best time to reverse privatisation of the grid was before it happened. Since then, the public has endured substantially higher costs than are necessary, while our infrastructure is creaking under the demands of the current electricity system ""” let alone investing anywhere near enough to keep pace with the urgent transformation to clean energy, and the complex planning and strategy that will involve.

""The second best time to reverse privatisation of the grid is now - through public ownership we can accelerate our transition to net zero while cutting costs and ensuring our future energy system guarantees clean, affordable and secure energy for all.""

A spokesperson for National Grid said: ""National Grid is a global business and we are proud to be one of the largest FTSE investors in the transition to net zero. Our transmission network represents around £20 a year on the average bill but enables GB's energy transition.

""We have committed £29bn of green investment between 2022 and 2026 to fund the infrastructure that will deliver a clean, fair and affordable energy future. Britain's stable regulatory environment enables this huge scale of investment at low cost, with the support of our shareholders, and close alignment with Britain's national energy strategy.""

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's modest gesture to Montecito locals for the town's Fourth of July celebrations is more than what any other celebrity has done, according to a resident

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have clearly impressed some of the locals since moving to the US three years ago.

And their very modest gesture to Montecito town's heroes is said to be ""more than any other celebrity resident has done"", according to one local who resides in the area.

Jill Ishkanian is a photographer who recently photographed Meghan while she shopped for fresh flowers at her local farmers' market in Montecito. And in total, she has photographed the Duchess of Sussex on four occasions since 2021.

The photographer has recently spoken out about how Meghan ""scares everyone"" in the world of media, but claims to have never received a complaint from the Duchess' team, and adds that she was simply ""around"" last week before she snapped Meghan with no tip-offs, because Montecito is ""a small place"".

Speaking to Newsweek, the esteemed photographer spoke of how when Meghan shopped at the farmers' market she was ""so nice"" to the vendors, with her exuding ""a different vibe"" than when Jill had snapped her before.

After recalling her experience photographing Meghan last week, Jill said ""something nice"" about the couple who stepped down as working members of the British Royal Family in 2020, with her gushing over how supportive they are of local heroes.

Jill explained how she has lived in the area ""on and off"" for 58 years, with the couple leaving her stunned when they showed up for the town's local Fourth of July celebrations.

She said: ""Every year I've gone to Fourth of July, the parade, the fireman's pancake breakfast, I've done all that stuff. I used to always say why do no celebrities go to this to support the firefighters and local things?""

Jill then added that when she saw the couple support the fire trucks, she thought ""I've got to hand it to them that is the first celebrity that has ever done that"". She then added that she was nice to her the other day, with the photographer now ""more on their team"".

This comes after it was reported that Meghan and Harry ""wanted to fly back to the US with President Biden on Air Force One"" after attending the Queen's funeral but their request was denied. Yesterday it was reported that a source told the MailOnline that the White House denied the request from the Duke and Duchess in case it caused a ""commotion"" and harmed the President's relations with the palace.

Love Island winter series star Jessie Wynter has responded to rumours she has had a boob job since leaving the show as she enjoys life with farmer boyfriend Will Young

Love Island star Jessie Wynter has responded to accusations she has had a boob job since leaving the show.

The personal trainer found love with farmer Will Young on the winter series of the hit ITV dating show earlier this year. She has had a whirlwind of a time since leaving the villa, having moved onto Will's family farm in Buckinghamshire as they ""save for a house"" and engagement rumours swirl. However, fans of the Aussie reality star, 26, think they have noticed a change in her appearance since the show.

They have questioned if Jessie has had surgery after noticing a difference in her breast size. Jessie took time out of her jet-setting life to answer fan questions, where one wanted to settle the rumours. They asked: ""Did you get another boob job?"" Jessie decided to open up to her fans and give an insight into the changes in her body.

She replied: ""No, I have just gained weight. I lost a lot of weight in the villa then lost more when I came out. I have gained over 7kgs back which means my boobies are bigger again!"" Jessie has been sharing insights of her life since leaving the villa with boyfriend Will. Recent reports suggest the 23-year-old is 'close to proposing' to his co-star less than a year into the pair's whirlwind relationship.

Will had admitted he envisions ""babies, marriage and living with Jessie for the rest of his life"" as he detailed what the couple's future looks like as they juggle lives between the UK and Wynter's Aussie home. Hinting at his proposal plans, Will said: ""Last week I made a romantic gesture to Jessie. I won't lie, we are creeping up to the ring. We are creeping up to it."" He told MailOnline that things would become clearer in ""a couple of months"".

Despite his romantic advances, Jessie claims she ""doesn't need a ring"" and she knows they ""love each other"". The TikTok star reportedly began ""awkwardly"" asking about rings over dinner, thinking he was being subtle but Jessie clocked what he was up to. However, it hasn't all been so easy for the pair as Will admitted to being ""immature"" in the relationship. The couple have ""silly disagreements"" and sometimes argue about making the bed.

However, they shared they are able to talk things through and move on. Jessie and Will recently went on a trip Down Under to visit her home in Tasmania. Will has shared they are planning to spend six months in the UK and six months in Australia. Jessie previously revealed how she sees herself living in the UK ""long-term"", but that is only if her farmer boyfriend ""doesn't enjoy Australia too much"".

The six legged cow from Brazil wasn't expected to stay alive. Now, his farmer claims the special cow is in excellent condition and leads a normal life

A six-legged calf that was born with an additional set of legs emerging from its neck has grown up and is still alive despite vets' predictions it would not last a year.

Farmer Divino Paulo was shocked when the calf later named Gambiarra saw the light of day on his farmland in the city of Edeia, Goias State, Brazil, last year. Paulo said that the surprise followed after he looked out into one of his cow pastures and realised that the little calf had six legs, with the extra pair growing from its neck. Vets were at first worried about Gambiarra's health and did not think it would survive due to its condition, the farmer said.

But in a recent interview with Brazilian newspaper 'Globo', Paulo claimed that the calf is in excellent condition and leads a normal life.

He said: ""He's alive and his name is Gambiarra. Federal University of Goias (UFG) professor, Paulo Jose Bastos Queiroz, explained that the condition is called polymelia.""

Queiroz continued that the disorder is a birth defect in which an affected individual has more than the usual number of limbs. He added: ""Polymelia can be caused by genetic mutations and also by the inadequate growth of twins during pregnancy. These causes may be associated with diseases or nutritional deficiencies that affect the development of fetuses during pregnancy.""

This isn't the first time we've seen miracle cows born with unique features, although not all of them thrive in the same way as Gambiarra. In 2016, visitors flocked to a farm in India after one of its cows gave birth to a two-headed calf that many believe is a miracle.

The bizarre-looking animal, which has two heads and one body, was born in May 2016 in Pannuganj village, in Uttar Pradesh, northern India. While the animal defied the odds to survive a full week, but it is reportedly struggled to feed and showed signs of deteriorating

Ignorant, uncaring and callous Tories and fellow right-wingers just don't get the crippling cost of living crisis.

Take former Conservative Minister and MP Ann Widdecombe, who is presumably not personally short of money after appearing on Strictly and TV reality shows plus panto.

Lecturing hard-up families with far fewer pounds than her to ditch cheese sarnies they can no longer afford shows a frightening
lack of concern from the doyen of the Reform UK Party.

Paying bills is the number one concern of households yet many Tories betray their lack of interest by trying to whip up hatred against anybody who is different from them.

Rishi Sunak's farming conference failing to produce a significant breakthrough is unsurprising when it was a PR stunt from the start.

But neglected and abandoned families will have their revenge at the ballot box.

Gift of hope

The rabbi husband of a British Jewish woman murdered by a terrorist who gave permission for five of her organs to be donated - including to a Palestinian man - is an act of incredible kindness.

The embrace shared between Leo Dee and Arab Muslim carpenter Abu Radia, who has Lucy's transplanted kidney, is deeply moving.

Especially when the rabbi must endure the grief of losing not only his wife but his two daughters, Maia, 20, and 15-year-old Rina, who were also killed in the shooting.

This profound generosity gives us hope that a senseless conflict may one day be ended by wonderful people.

Sausage role

Having bouncers on the doors of a ­late-night Central London Greggs does sound a bit flakey.

But if it means customers in the Leicester Square area get their hands on a much-needed snack after a night out then why not?

At least it's not another half-baked idea we usually get from the local council.

Standing on his smallholding in the Brazilian state of Para, a member of the country's 'river people' says scheme representatives offered him a loan that never materialised

Izaurino Alves had never heard of carbon credits when the ­strangers arrived at his remote Amazonian home a few years ago.

The grandad, 59, was also unaware they were part of an alleged multimillion-pound scheme using land where he lives that links to Kenneth Noye. Izaurino is a member of the ribeirinho, the ""river people"" who make their living by fishing, farming and harvesting forest products.

His wooden home is a long way from Noye's one-bedroom flat in Kent which shares same address as the headquarters of the Amazon Forest People carbon credit scheme. A 2020 AFP brochure says it is protecting the area where Izaurino lives from deforestation and fighting for ""social, economic and environmental justice"".

Alongside pictures of smiling children, it says they ""own and protect"" 368,000 acres of forest, an area almost as large as Greater London, and have been working with the 6,200 ribeirinho since 2008 in an area that is being logged ""rapidly and illegally"". But Izaurino is one of many ­residents we spoke to living within the footprint of the AFP project who say they have not been helped by it.

But Izaurino is one of many ­residents we spoke to living within the footprint of the AFP project who say they have not been helped by it. Standing on his smallholding in the north-eastern Brazilian state of Para, a two-hour boat ride from any road, Izaurino said scheme representatives offered him a loan that never materialised.

""They came here with beautiful words, saying their interest was in preserving the forest, in keeping the trees up because it's important for oxygen,"" he said. ""They said they were going to lend us money for equipment but we never heard back from them. What am I supposed to do?""

Izaurino and his wife Maria, 49, live on a plot the size of 600 football pitches, small by Amazonian ­standards. They are one of hundreds of families inside the scheme area who live in government settlements that give them rights over the land. The smallholding supports their eight children and 22 grandchildren.

A source involved in the project denies the claims, saying they have sought to behave correctly. They claim to have funded a school for 180 children and adults, provided solar power facilities and clean water. We made the three-day journey from the UK to this remote corner of the Brazilian jungle.

Our trip involved 20 hours on a boat, overnighting in hammocks. The project, called Pacajai Redd+, is funded by an offshore company called Avoided ­Deforestation Project (Manaus) Limited (ADPML), a mystery to most people we spoke to. The 40-year scheme is due to end in 2048 and has sold 10 million carbon credits.

It is not known how much money it has raised or invested in the land and its inhabitants - the figures are not publicly available. The venture is one of four separate controversial carbon credit schemes in the state. A report by the charity the World Rainforest Movement published last year raised concerns, saying they lack transparency about who owns the schemes and how much money they have raised.

It also questioned the claims being made by the projects about the levels of reductions in CO2 emissions. ADPML is being sued as part of a case being taken against the scheme by Andreia Macedo Barreto, a lawyer representing the local people. The writ claims the scheme is illegal because rather than being based on private land, it includes two government settlement projects, on which 1,151 families live.

Odivan Ferreira CorrÃªa, ­president of the Portel Rural Workers' Union, said his colleagues met four representatives of ADPML in 2020. He said one was armed with a pistol when they offered the union around £80,000 to help their work. He said the money was rejected after the representatives refused to reveal who was financing the project.

""It's us who protect the forest, we the people who live here. When this company came they talked about helping us but we haven't seen anything happen,"" Odivan explains from his office in the city of Portel. An ex-vice president of the union, who we are naming only as GraÃ§a, said: ""This project should be cancelled.

""Our people should be compensated because these companies are making money out of their lands without telling them who will have the money."" Land ownership is often disputed in the region, due to a poor registration system and claims on public areas using altered documentation.

We visited one settlement where around a dozen men were awaiting our arrival. Everyone had a similar story, involving a visit from people claiming to be from the project who made promises they allegedly failed to keep. Flanked by his wife Helena, Manoel Correia Dos Santos, 67, shows us a stove given to him through the scheme, saying: ""I want the money to come back.""

Antonio De Pinho, 46, father of two, said: ""This money would mean our ­children could go to school."" Sebastiao Gibson Ramos, 52, said representatives from the project said they were from an NGO. ""We need this money to help preserve this area and bring healthcare and education,"" he said.

""Money is in their pockets while we are still in need of the basics. Please tell the world what is happening here."" Asked who was behind the project, he said: ""It's a big mystery, a big secret."" Grandfather Antonio Valente Da Silva, 71, added: ""I believe that there's something really wrong going on.""

How Noye laundered cash from 'Heist of the Century'

At 6.30am on 26 November 1983, six armed men entered a warehouse on the edge of Heathrow Airport. They left with 6,800 gold bars worth £26 million. It would be dubbed the Heist of the Century but the most audacious part of the crime was yet to come. The groundbreaking methods employed by the villains to keep the proceeds of the robbery changed the face of modern organised crime and policing.

Old Kent Road armed robbers ""Mad"" Micky McAvoy and Brian ""The Colonel"" Robinson teamed up with Noye and John ""Goldfinger"" Palmer to convert the gold into cash. Noye later told his trial that he had set up offshore companies with shares held by trusts, though he claimed the huge sums of cash invested were not from the robbery.

Gordon Parry and Michael Relton, a public school-educated solicitor ""Chancellor of the Exchequer"" to the robbers, were also behind the money laundering plot. Three months after the robbery, Parry flew to Jersey where he met a banker to discuss setting up a company in the UK's Channel Islands whose beneficiaries would remain anonymous.

In February, 1984, Selective Estates (Jersey) was established. At the same time Melchester Holdings was set up in Panama City, where similar secrecy laws applied. In both cases the undisclosed beneficiaries were Relton, jailed for 12 years, and Parry, a Kent property dealer played by Sean Harris in the BBC's The Gold, who got 10 years.

The money was then funnelled back into the UK and invested in property including in London's Docklands, turning £7.5 million into £18 million in just over a year, and cottages belonging to Cheltenham Ladies' College. Then Met Commissioner Sir Kenneth Newman criticised banks at the time, saying they had allowed the Brink's-Mat gang to become ""robber barons"". MPs said in 2018 that they were prepared to look at ways of forcing Jersey and Guernsey to introduce public registers of company ownership. It hasn't happened.

What are carbon credits?

Carbon credits sell customers the dream of buying their way out of the environmental crisis.

The idea is that green investments can cancel out the effects of polluting through projects like tree planting or stopping the deforestation of the Amazon. It is based on the concept that the ""polluter pays"" according to how much carbon they generate. This is sometimes known as carbon offsetting.

Some of the biggest companies in the world have used carbon credits as a way of trying to make up for the pollution they have created. The unregulated market was worth £1.6billion in 2021 with firms like Shell,

Disney and Gucci buying them as a way of trying to be ""carbon neutral"". But there is increasing evidence suggesting that many projects exaggerate the environmental benefits.

Larry Lohmann of the Corner House campaign group said: ""By allowing companies to buy offsets instead of reducing their emissions, government are allowing years of inaction before the industries in question begin to do what they have to do to deal with global warming. Worse, these credits do not always even represent verifiable reductions. They come from projects that merely claim to be saving carbon over what would have happened without the credit sales.""

Recent research into Verra, the leading certifier for carbon credits, found 90% of the rainforest credits do not represent genuine carbon reductions. Verra has questioned the methodology used and does not agree with the conclusions. They say their work since 2009 has seen billions of dollars channelled into preserving forests.

But today's Mirror investigation shows the lack of transparency in the market, with project owners hiding their identities behind offshore companies. Meanwhile, it is often not known how much money the projects generate, where the cash has gone and how much is invested in the land and those living on it.

Noye's life of crime

Groundbreaking 7 Up! documentary star Nick Hitchon has died after sharing that he had been given a throat cancer diagnosis in 2019 and was told he would have a year to live

7 Up! documentary star Nick Hitchon has died after revealing he had a year to live following a throat cancer diagnosis in 2019.

Nick was one of the original stars of the programme in 1964. It followed the lives of a group of seven-year-olds as they all grew up across the UK - both rich, poor, rural and urban. Nick was a farmer's son and grew up in the Yorkshire Dales. He went on to become a nuclear fusion scientist and was a professor at the University of Wisconsin until retiring in June.

The documentary star sadly died in July aged 65 after a throat cancer diagnosis, which he shared with viewers when appearing on 63 Up in 2019. Nick said he was unlikely to live beyond the end of 2020. In Seven Up! Nick was first introduced to viewers when he was walking along a road near his home. He was quizzed about if he had a girlfriend, and gave the memorable response: ""I don't want to answer that. I don't answer those kind of questions.""

Nick clearly had an inkling of where his future career might take him, as he told cameras: ""When I grow up, I'd like to find out all about the moon and all that."" Seven Up! was originally planned to catch up with its 14 cast members in the year 2000, however it was decided they would check in with the stars ever seven years. 11 of the cast appeared in the latest follow up in 2019, on from 56 Up in 2012 and 49 Up in 2005.

TV and film director Michael Apted chose Nick to appear in the show, but initially found it hard to recruit a rural child who would talk on camera. Michael chanced upon Nick at his primary school, and he featured in the programme despite only being six when the show aired. Nick was the eldest of three boys and son of farmer Guy Hitchon and his wife Iona. In the first follow-up, Nick was a teenage boarder at a Yorkshire grammar school and had no interest in following his father into farming.

In 21 Up, Nick was studying physics at Merton College, Oxford. He hit out at how some viewers perceived him as a seven-year-old, saying: ""One of my friends had me pointed out to him as being destined to run the farm and being educationally pretty inept."" He shared that he had made a ""conscious effort to be more outgoing"". By the time the next documentary came around, Nick had made the move over to America.

He was working as assistant professor at Wisconsin University, which he had joined in 1982. Nick remained at the university until the end of his career. He married fellow Oxford student Jacqui Bush in 1979. On 28 Up, he shared: ""Trying to become a reasonably well-adjusted person was for me a bit of a struggle for a while and I was given a fantastic opportunity when I went to university, and that really saved my bacon.""

Nick later revealed he had welcomed a son, got divorced from his first wife, married a second time and shared the ailing health of his parents. By the time of 63 Up, both of his parents had passed away. In that series, Nick said: ""I'm still the same little kid, really. I think I can relate to that little guy who was all eager and all earnest trying to answer all the questions."" Nick was the second death among the original group, after when Lynn Johnson passed away in 2013. Michael Apted died in 2021, aged 79.

Fashion and travel writer Kat Farmer and wine expert Helen McGinn appeared in a segment filmed in Grindelwald, Switzerland

This Morning viewers were disappointed with the ITV daytime show for showzing a luxury holiday segment during the cost of living crisis.

After a Christmas break, Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield returned to our screens to provide fans with all the latest news.

Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis even returned as a regular guest to give out advice about all things personal finance.

He was available to answer concerned viewers' queries amid the cost of living crisis.

However, halfway through Tuesday's episode, fashion and travel writer Kat Farmer and wine expert Helen McGinn appeared in a segment filmed from a hot tub in Grindelwald, Switzerland.

They relaxed in the tub as they enjoyed endless wine and luxury snacks while they talked about all the activities available to do in the gorgeous village.

Phillip and Holly were jealous of the duo enjoying a relaxing holiday and many viewers were less than impressed.

""So after Martin Lewis giving out cost of living advice, there's a luxury trip to the Alps?"", one user asked.

Another disappointed person wrote: ""I'm really getting fed up with these sections where they send people to places of expense for free on a show to people who don't have 2 pennies to rub together!!!""

One said: ""Please can you stop sending people abroad to live the life of luxury while we all just wallow in our poorness"".

""They're in the Swiss Alps and I've gotta go and work in a factory until midnight,"" another viewer posted.

The show only recently received backlash when fans complained about the long break Phillip and Holly took over Christmas.

The duo - who have been presenting the ITV show together since 2009 - hosted a live edition of This Morning on December 9 2022 before going on holiday.

Josie Gibson, 37, and Andi Peters, 52, covered for them for four weeks, with Holly and Phil returning on January 9.

Fans were confused with how long they had off and took to social media to question it.

""B****y Hell! How many weeks do Phil and Holly need off!!!!! I love Josie though,"" one viewer complained.

""I swear Holly and Phil have not worked a week straight on This Morning for months,"" another echoed.

A third This Morning viewer tweeted: ""Holly and Phil seem to have more time off than they do actually presenting. Wish I could have time off with my family like they seem to do.""

Corporate lawyer Zoe Bucknell has lost a bitter neighbour dispute at her £1.3 million country home in Kent with farmer Mark Stoneham who plans to convert a barn into two houses

A high-flying lawyer has been told she is ""not automatically entitled to peace and quiet"" at her £1.3 million country home by a judge as she lost a bitter neighbour dispute.

Zoe Bucknell clashed with game-shooting pedigree beef farmer Mark Stoneham over his plans to convert a barn into two houses next door to her farmhouse in Kent, while using her drive as access for heavy construction traffic.

The corporate lawyer, a keen horse rider with her own stables at home, said ""noise disturbance, vibration (and) fumes"" from traffic passing up the 55 metre driveway past her ""quiet and secluded forever home"" posed a threat not just to her peace but to the fabric of the driveway and the home itself.

She claimed her enjoyment of horse riding would be ""adversely affected"" because of increased traffic from the new houses when completed and that vibrations from building trucks could damage the foundations of her Grade-II listed home, Holywell Farmhouse, near Sevenoaks.

The lawyer sued, claiming she was entitled to preserve the peace that surrounded her home when she bought it nine years ago.

But High Court Judge Paul Matthews has now thrown out her bid to ban the extra traffic, saying she ""is not automatically entitled to the maintenance of the same rural peace and quiet that she enjoyed when she bought in 2014.""

London's High Court heard that Mrs Bucknell and her family moved into Holywell Farmhouse in 2014, while Mr Stoneham's company bought the next door yard and barns from his family, with plans to develop them, in 2020.

Mr Stoneham now breeds pedigree shorthorn beef cattle on an 800 acre estate in Oxfordshire and describes himself as ""a keen game shot,"" but grew up on the family farm in Kent.

Nicholas Isaac KC, for Mr Stoneham's company Alchemy Estates (Holywell) Ltd, told Judge Matthews that a right of way over Mrs Bucknell's drive to the barns was granted ""for all time and for all purposes"" to Mr Stoneham's father and uncle in 1972 and that he wanted to use that right to complete the build and provide access to the new houses.

But Richard Clegg, for Mrs Bucknell, told the judge this would be ""wrongful use"" of the right of way over her driveway, and would put her ""forever home"" in ""jeopardy"".

In 2021 she went to court and obtained an interim injunction banning construction vehicles from using the driveway to access the barn conversion site.

But Mr Stoneham pressed ahead with the barn conversion despite the lawyer's objections, making an alternative access track to the site over fields.

Mrs Bucknell then sued at the High Court, seeking a permanent injunction to ban building traffic from her driveway and stop anyone living in the two houses from using it, as well as forcing the farmer to pay her damages.

But through his company Mr Stoneham fought the claim, insisting the lawyer was ""catastrophising"" the situation.

Dismissing her bid for an injunction and handing victory to Mr Stoneham's company, the judge said: ""Demolition and construction are facts of everyday life, and there must be give and take in relation to them.

""It is clear from the evidence of the traffic management experts that the additional use imposed on the driveway by the habitation of two houses built on the yard would be very small in comparison with the existing use.

""There is no evidence that any damage would be caused to the (driveway) surface by the increase in traffic movements as a result of two extra houses being inhabited.

""Use by the occupants of two houses on the yard would, in my judgement, not interfere unreasonably with use by others having the like right, nor with the enjoyment by the claimant of her land.

""I do not consider that it would amount to excessive use or that it would cause an actionable nuisance, even in the locality as it was in 2014, or indeed 1972.

""The claimant is not automatically entitled to the maintenance of the same rural peace and quiet that she enjoyed when she bought in 2014.

""A grant of a right of way is not to be restricted to access to the land merely for such purposes as were reasonably required at the date of the grant,"" the judge concluded.

The ruling means that the build can be completed using the driveway as access and the occupants of the new houses can also use the drive.

Loved up Love Island couple Will Young and Jessie Wynter have made the trip Down Under to visit her family as the farmer made a good first impression on her nan

Love Islander Will Young has finally met Jessie Wynter's family Down Under and even made a sweet gesture to her nan.

The winter series stars made the trek to Australia to visit Jessie's family after first meeting in the South African villa earlier this year.

The loved-up pair have already been sharing a string of snaps from their trip as Jessie gushed about being with her ""favourite people in the whole world"".

Taking to her Instagram, the Aussie shared pics of the couple on their various adventures so far.

She wrote: ""Sydney day 2. Another fun day with some of my favourite people in the whole world.

""Rachel and I took Will to see the Sydney harbour bridge and Operah house, went out for a lovely dinner by the water at Luna Lu, explored the city, went on a podcast (was loads of fun), we trulyyy welcomed Will to Aussie culture by getting him to do his first shoey,"" she said.

A shoey is Australian slang for drinking a celebratory drink out of a shoe.

Jessie continued to gush over the trip so far as she added: ""Oh, and we got to hold a parrot annnnd, Will bought my grandma flowers. Can't explain how happy I am right now.""

Farmer Will, 24, can be seen making a good impression on Jessie's nan as she shared a picture of him presenting her with a large bouquet.

They have also been taking in the iconic landmarks and Will appears to have been embracing Aussie culture with his shoey stunt.

Jessie, 26, has previously expressed her wish of taking boyfriend Will to her home turf.

She said: ""I am looking to go back to Australia at the end of May because I think that's when my visa is until.

""Will might be coming with me, which is really exciting, and then we're going to look at what other types of visas I can have when I get back over here,"" she previously told The Sun.

Jessie added how she sees herself living in the UK ""long-term"", but that is only if her farmer boyfriend ""doesn't enjoy Australia too much"".

She added: ""Everyone I know from the UK has been saying Will's going to love Australia, so I'm concerned.""

The fan favourites were dumped from the villa after a compatibility vote failed in their favour - with the pair just missing out on the final. Despite losing out, the pair have continued to pursue their relationship.

Jessie has been staying with Will's family on their farm in Buckinghamshire and has even been helping out with the lambing season.

Last month, they sparked engagement rumours after sharing snaps of their romantic holiday in Paris.

Will wrote: ""Travelling and spending all this time together just gets me so excited for the future and crazy to think we have only known each other for 4 months!

""I can't wait for our next adventure, possibly going back to Jessie's home and creating even more memories.""

Jessie replied: ""Love you so damn much!! Exciting things to come,"" followed by a red love heart emoji.

The couple shared a passionate kiss in front of the Eiffel Tower and at Disneyland Paris.

""In the villa, I asked Will where he would like to travel and he said Paris. SO for his birthday his family and I surprised him with a trip to Paris,"" Jessie added.

""Paris was also on my bucket list but I didn't think I'd be going anytime soon or ticking it off with someone I'm so in love with.

""Who would have thought that a girl all the way from little Tasmania and a farmer from the country in the UK would be madly in love visiting Paris together. Love you, Will.""

And Will appeared to hint he could see a wedding in the future with Jessie.

One fan wrote: ""Love yewwww guysssssss. First Love Island wedding 2023 hopefully in the foreseeable future,"" to which Will replied: ""Agreed.""

Farmer David Venables murdered his wife Brenda in 1982, hiding her body in a septic tank on their Worcestershire pig farm and inheriting her fortune. Her corpse was found 37 years later

The family of a murdered woman, whose husband hid her corpse in his septic tank for 37 years, are suing him to recover her fortune.

Wealthy farmer David Venables killed his ""quiet and gentle"" wife, Brenda, in May 1982, and dumped her body on the 440-acre pig farm. The 90-year-old was finally undone in 2019 after he sold his home at Kempsey, Worcestershire, for £460,000 and her remains were discovered during work on the underground tank.

After her disappearance, Venables inherited her estate - believed to be her share of Quaking House Farm plus a lucrative stake in the family business. But following Venables conviction last year for Brenda's murder, her family has gone to court seeking compensation and to force him to forfeit what he inherited.

The lawsuit is spearheaded by Brenda's nephew, Timothy Sheppy, 58, of Evesham, one of the five nieces and nephews who survived her. At a High Court hearing last week, Judge Master Richard Davison said: ""You want him held to account for what he gained from the death of Brenda.""

Alan Collins, solicitor for the family, said they are suing for damages for the attack on Brenda and want Venables to be replaced by Mr Sheppy as ­administrator of her estate. Appearing via a video link from prison, Venables challenged the compensation claim, insisting that he hopes to appeal his murder conviction.

But Master Davison granted ""summary judgement"" in favour of the estate's compensation claim, with the figure to be decided at a later date. He saw the ""clear case for removing Venables as personal representative"" but said another court would have to decide it.

If Mr Sheppy is substituted, he will then go on to try to recover what Venables inherited, the judge was told. Mr Collins said valuing Brenda's estate would be difficult due to the time that has elapsed since the murder. The case will return to court for an assessment of damages for the attack on Brenda and for the application to remove Venables from the estate. Brenda was 23 when she met her future husband at a young farmers' event in 1955.

They married in June 1960 before moving into newly built Quaking House Farm in February 1961. The couple ran a nursery and piggery from the site, but Venables - dubbed ""Dirty David"" due to his reputation as a ladies' man - was said to have had numerous affairs.

He was convicted by a majority verdict of the murder and jailed for life at Worcester Crown Court in July last year. After his conviction, Brenda's nieces and nephews said the murder of their ""gentle"" aunt would haunt them.

They said: ""We feel utter horror and despair that Brenda was murdered. She was no harm to anyone, being a gentle and increasingly quiet woman. We'll never know how she died or how much she suffered. We pray her death was quick.""

Jail sentences for key figures in bent companies that netted £6.5million

Even after years of exposing scams I'm still shocked by the cold indifference some fraudsters have towards the suffering they cause. Take 31-year-old Lewis Manley, a predatory sales rep for a web of fraudulent solar heating companies.

Among his many victims was a retired Suffolk farmer I'll just call by his first name, Graham. Although registered with the ­Telephone Preference Service, Graham was repeatedly phoned about products for his solar heating system.

A call on March 4, 2016, resulted in him buying a storage battery for £5,900. It was installed just six days later, a typical tactic used by the scammers that was designed to give the victim little time to reconsider or cancel. A second call resulted in him being sold a PV+ power booster for £2,995.

He was then sold an ""Eco Power Saver"" for £3,900 and an ""Air 2 Air"" heating system for £3,500. All the products had huge mark-ups and some proved useless or even worse than his existing ones. The crooks were just getting started and now Manley came on the scene, turning up in his blue BMW.

He gained Graham's trust by claiming to be a farmer's son and first sold an iBoost water heater for £1,995, despite the fact Graham already had one. He next flogged an inverter for £4,000, claiming that Graham's existing one was faulty, even though it was still under warranty and could have been replaced for free.

Manley then sold him an extra solar panel for £4,200. Finally, the leech used scare stories about possible fires to sell a £3,500 ""fire raptor"". In total Graham paid almost £30,000 and, looking back, says that he was overwhelmed by persuasive sales pitches and did not know where to turn for advice.

""I am disgusted with the amount of money they took from me,"" Graham wrote in a victim statement. ""They knew that I was retired and trusted them and they took ­advantage of that.""

Other victims told how they felt ""stupid and gullible"" and ""upset and embarrassed"". Many live in fear of more scams, one saying: ""When the telephone rings it causes anxiety, I don't know if the person on the other end will be family or a conman"" and another stating: ""I cannot concentrate on daily life, the worry is always there, I dread every phone call.""

This week Manley, from Challock, Kent, was jailed for two years after being convicted at Southwark Crown Court of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering following an investigation by Essex Trading Standards and the National Trading Standards Regional Investigation Team.

An extra eight month consecutive sentence was added because he was in breach of a previous suspended sentence for conspiracy to commit theft. He was described as the most prolific sales rep at a web of four companies - GreenPowerSolutions, Green Planet Advisory, Offgridplus and Green Power Energy Solutions.

They had a turnover of more than £6.5million, with the average age of the victims being 71. Manley was paid almost £380,000 in commission for his dirty work. In sentencing, Judge Martin Griffith told him: ""You were at the very heart of this conspiracy.""

Another key figure was Antony Dean, who was a director of three of the companies and installed his wife as director of the fourth. The 42-year-old, from Chelmsford, Essex, pocketed £407,000 and was described by Judge Griffith as ""the driving force in this offending"".

He was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering, jailed for three years and banned from being a director for ten years. The court had heard in mitigation of the impact that a jail sentence would have on his family, but the judge told him this was something he should have considered ""when this fraud was generating large amounts of money from many victims"".

His wife Emily Dean, 32, and David Jenkins, 52, also from Chelmsford, admitted money laundering and were each given 100 hours of unpaid work.

""They were all handsomely rewarded for their combined efforts in persuading consumers, many elderly and vulnerable, to part with money for purported energy saving products,"" said Alison Lambert, prosecuting. ""Numerous claims and representations were made about the products which were not true.""

Typical lies were that the companies were part of a Government green energy scheme or had taken over from the customer's solar panel installer and were conducting free checks on their system, which was just a ploy used so that sales reps could get a foot through the door.

They also claimed that new laws were due to make their products mandatory. After sentencing, Judge Griffith commended Essex Trading Standards for ""a lot of hard work over a great deal of years"". Three others will be sentenced at a later date. Manley's partner Jordan Lewis was found not guilty of fraud and money laundering charges.

781,"Nearly half of Brits wish they could spend more time with closest friends, study finds","https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/friends-catch-ups-wellbeing-benefits-30388619","Nearly half of Brits wish they could spend more time with closest friends, study finds

A catch-up with friends is as beneficial to wellbeing as a nice soak in the bath, or a vigorous exercise session, research has found

Nearly half of Brits (46%) say they wish they could spend quality time with their closest friends more often, a study has revealed.

A survey of 2,000 adults found that 67% feel spending time with their nearest and dearest pals is good for their mind, body, and soul.

The top bonding activities Brits enjoy sharing with their friends include getting together for a coffee (51%), enjoying a meal out (43%), or going for a walk (46%).

And they feel that a 25-minute chat with a close friend is as beneficial to their wellbeing as a vigorous exercise session, or a nice relaxing soak in the bath.

Overall, it takes one hour and 49 minutes spent in the company of friends, for Brits to feel the positive impact on their overall wellbeing.

And the research, commissioned by plant-based beverage brand Califia Farms, revealed 41% prefer to catch up with friends in the comfort of their own home, rather than venturing out to a cafÃ© or bar.

Sophie Webb, from Califia Farms, which has a Cold Brew ready-to-drink range, said: ""It's great to see that Brits view their regular coffee catch-ups as important, and people consider it a top bonding experience to have with friends.

""We understand life is busy, and we all wish we just had a little more time to catch up with our friends.""

Summer is the perfect time to schedule plans with loved ones, as 56% feel the longer evenings allow greater opportunity to do this.

And 45% think this time of year allows them to host more at home - with having a picnic or barbeque (56%), and garden get-togethers (50%), also featuring.

With the rise of sobriety, 55% prefer to ditch the alcohol and connect with friends over a coffee - as it allows for richer conversation (34%), greater connection (31%), and is more cost beneficial (31%).

A quarter (24%) believe a one-hour, caffeine-fuelled catch-up is more valuable than an entire night out - with popular reasons including price (32%), convenience (30%), and noise levels (26%).

A sense of connection (67%), happiness (62%), and belonging (47%) are the top advantages of spending time with closest confidants, according to the OnePoll.com study.

It also emerged 72% feel quality time spent talking is the most important part of get-togethers - compared to trying new experiences (14%), or ""fancy"" aesthetic surroundings (10%).

In response to the findings, Califia Farms has partnered with singer, Rachel Stevens, and her best friend, Nikki Glazer Hodge.

Rachel Stevens said: ""Since spending time in LA, I fell in love with coffee over ice.

""Alongside chatting to Nikki, it's one of my favourite things, and even when I don't have a lot of time, I cherish our ritual of coffee and conversation at home.

""We block out time, make sure the children are entertained, and settle down in one of our houses so that we can sit back, relax, and have a good natter - it's definitely quality over quantity for us.""

Love Island is travelling to South Africa for a second winter series, which is set to launch on January 16. A string of singletons have been confirmed to be heading into the villa including a farmer and rugby star

Love Island 2023 is set to be a steamy one as the sexy singletons are preparing to head into the South African villa in a bid to find love.

And ITV has announced its full line-up of new glossy Islanders looking for love (and maybe a PLT deal or two). Among those heading into the villa for a hot winter include a makeup artist, rising social media star and a rugby hunk ahead of the new winter series starting on January 16.

But the Islanders certainly aren't the only new kids on the block, with Maya Jama taking over from Laura Whitmore as host. And bosses are making sure that Maya will be introduced with as much glamour and fanfare as possible by splurging on an epic stunt in the most expensive series opener yet.

The brand new plush villa, which overlooks the prison where Nelson Mandela spent his jail term, is set to spark the raunchiest series yet with a number of x-rated additions...

It's also been rumoured that, after the explosive reaction to former Islander Adam Collard entering the Love Island villa, another ex-Islander is set to return to the series.

Arabella Chi is rumoured to be heading into the villa and even teased the fact on her Instagram page earlier this month.

So what can we expect from this year's cohort? Let's take a look...

Out of choice and maybe because in the past I've had commitment issues - but I'd say it's mainly just the wrong boy, wrong time.

Fun loving, kind hearted, easy to get along with and flirty.

What gives you the ""˜ick'?

There's a few""¦ when guys have no pillows on their bed. I went into a guy's room once and I was like, ""˜You don't have any pillows, where am I supposed to lay my head?'

Tell us something not many people know about you?

Why Love Island and why now?

Do you fall in love quickly?

""My family and friends would say I do. I'm the type of person that wears my heart on my sleeve. If I find someone I click with, I fall very hard, very fast. Sometimes that can be a bad thing. I'm a very emotional person. It can be a blessing and a curse.""

Tell us something not many people know about you?

What do you think you'll bring to the Villa?

I get on with people in general, so I think people will naturally be drawn to me. I'm a lovable person. I do put myself first and I'm not scared to just go for what I want, if I have to step on people's toes or things like that.

What's your ""˜elevator pitch' for why someone should want to date you?

I'm a great boyfriend. I'm very kind and thoughtful. Parents always love me. They say, ""˜He's a good person, you should marry him!' Once I'm with someone I'm always all about that person. I'm very vocal about that. I'm a catch!

Why would you say you're single?

I have dated, but no-one's just clicked fully on all levels with me. I'm not one to rush into a relationship if I don't feel like it's right for me. I'm not saying you have to tick every single box, we just have to vibe and be on the same level. So, until I meet someone like that, I'm going to stay single.

Damson Idris. He's an amazing actor and I've seen videos of him when he's not acting and he's quite funny. And I think I'm quite funny, I think it'd go handin-hand.

Music is a big part of Love Island - who do you have on repeat and why?

Chasing Euphoria by M Huncho.

Who are your dream dinner party guests?

I'd definitely invite my dad, we get on so well, he's so funny, he's hilarious. I'd have my sisters there as well. Also, Arsene Wenger - me, him and my dad would just be talking about football for ages.

If money was no object, what would be your ideal first date?

I'd take a plane to Monaco, do a helicopter ride over the city and then do a yacht dinner date The next morning we'd go scuba diving. I've never been and I've always wanted to. So, we'll do the cute dinner at night and then dive 40 feet the next morning

It's hard to think of one in particular, but I would say that the best dates have been with my ex. We went on loads of holidays.

Someone who is tight and stingy, it makes me feel sick. If you're tight, I will never see you again in my life, honestly

Do you fall in love quickly?

I can fancy someone so quickly and think that I'm in love, but I can easily fall out of love with them. When someone keeps me on my toes it's the chase that I like.

Tell us something not many people know about you?

I have this weird phobia of certain things touching me, like if it's something creamy or weird I actually feel like I want to throw up. Certain things can't touch me and I can't share drinks. I don't like anything milky - if milk touched my skin it would make me feel so sick. I hate it!

Who would you want to play you in a movie of your life?

J.Lo because I feel like she's actually talented and she's beautiful, she's someone that I look up to.

Music is a big part of Love Island - who do you have on repeat and why?

Anything by Burna Boy.

Who is your celebrity crush?

""Channing Tatum - I don't like pretty boys, they give me the ""˜ick' because they always have a crap personality. Channing Tatum is handsome but not too pretty. He's manly and he can dance. If a man can dance I'm in love with him straight away.""

Who are your dream dinner party guests?

Piers Morgan, I'd love to have a conversation with him. I like how direct and honest he is, I think he's so sick. I would like to have a debate with him. Other than him, I'd then just go for really good looking people like J.Lo and Channing Tatum.

Will Young, 23

Farmer Will Young hails from Buckinghamshire and is looking forward to spending some time away from his farm to focus on finding the one.

Why Love Island and why now?

""Having grown up on a farm, it's been quite difficult juggling relationships and work. Love Island will give me time away from the farm to solely go out and find love. I think I'm at the time of my life where I'm mature enough to go and find a wife.""

Does a potential partner need to be good with animals?

My mum didn't step on the farm for the first 20 years of my mum and dad's marriage! What attracts me is energy, if the energy is there, she can do whatever she wants. As long as she respects what I do and my busy times of the year, then that's all I need. If she loves it, bonus! But it's not a big issue for me.

What do you think you'll bring to the Villa?

Good energy, I'm a bit of a cheeky chappy, good vibes, good to be around.

What's your ""˜elevator pitch' for why someone should want to date you?

I bring real good, loving energy and I'm a wholesome boy who can bring you to the farm and show you his animals and just live one of those happy lives in the cottage.

Honestly? Probably commitment issues. I self sabotage myself sometimes when I've got a good thing going. I do like my own space and my own time; I haven't got to stress about anything and just worry about myself.

How would friends/family describe you?

On Cloud 9 probably.

Best / worst date story?

I'm not a big dater but the dates I've been on have been super romantic. For the right girl I can be quite romantic. Once I took a girl on a date to the bottom of our farm where there's this really nice hill with amazing views surrounding it. I put fairy lights all up in the tree, I set up a picnic with wine and we watched the sunset.

What gives you the ""˜ick'?

When someone's rude.

Do you fall in love quickly?

Yes and no. With the right girl I would fall in love quickly. But I make up my mind super quick. I only need one or two dates and I know whether I want to keep seeing someone. With girls I like, I wear my heart on my sleeve.

What's your claim to fame?

Claudia Winkleman came to my farm. She was lovely and got stuck in. She poured water over me.

Tell us something not many people know about you?

""Every night I light a candle and meditate for 20-25 minutes. A girl I was seeing told me to meditate, I tried it and loved it. I stopped seeing her and carried on meditating! It's a nice way to self reflect, taking a minute on my day/week. It's really nice and sets me up for a nice sleep.""

Who would you want to play you in a movie of your life?

""Sir David Attenborough. Imagine hearing his calming voice talking while he's feeding the animals, his top off, some short shorts""¦ he would rock it. ""

Do you have any unusual skills?

I can lamb a sheep""¦

Music is a big part of Love Island - what album do you have on repeat/ why?

House and techno, big time. I go to a lot of summer festivals to listen to house and techno.

Who is your celebrity crush?

Margot Robbie. She's so attractive.

Who are your dream dinner party guests?

Definitely Sir David Attenborough again - he's back in, in his shorts. And probably Boris Johnson. He would be really interesting to speak to. The conversation would be on point.

If money was no object, what would be your ideal first date?

Having dinner and wine on a boat in the middle of the sea, watching the sunset. Or on a beach camping. Definitely wholesome vibes, something to do with nature

Anna-May Robey, 20

Swansea lass Anna-May, who is a payroll administrator, revealed he is looking for someone who makes her laugh as she has been single for ""quite a while"".

Why Love Island and why now?

""I want a boyfriend, I want to find someone who makes me laugh. I've been single for quite a while, my mother is bugging me, she's like, ""˜You need to find a boyfriend.' I'm just excited to try something new and I think going on Love Island is a good way to meet someone.""

Best or worst date story?

""I went on a date once and I never saw him again. We went for food and shared a bottle of wine. As I was speaking to him he fell asleep! I had to clink his wine glass to wake him up.""

How would friends/family describe you?

""Energetic. I'm always running around singing and screaming. My parents are always like, ""˜Shut up!' I work from home all day so I don't really speak to people in person for two or three days a week, so when my father comes home, he'll want to sit down and chill out, and I'm there chewing his ear off! I would definitely say I am a chatterbox.""

What do you think you'll bring to the Villa?

I will bring fun, I'm always up for a laugh, if someone tells me to go and dive in the pool I will probably do it. I'll bring energy to the Villa, I'll get everyone up playing games! I""˜m also not afraid to get in someone's way; if I like someone, I'll let them know.

What's your ""˜elevator pitch' for why someone should want to date you?

I'm funny, energetic, spontaneous.

Why would you say you're single?

I'm single because I'm fussy and I get the ick easily. I also go for the same type of guy so I need to broaden my horizons, so I hope to do that in the Villa.

What gives you the ""˜ick'?

I don't like people who brag or who are really materialistic. Another thing is watching a boy get his haircut and the barber pushing up the seat, you know the pumping thing? I used to go to the barber with my ex and I used to sit there and every time the barber would do it, I would have to look away.

Do you fall in love quickly?

Quickly - and I become obsessed with someone when they don't like me. But, when they start giving me the attention that I want I'm not interested anymore.

Music is a big part of Love Island - who do you have on repeat and why?

I would say anything by Coldplay, I love Coldplay, I absolutely love them, I'd probably listen to Coldplay forever.

I like a bit of Anthony Joshua but I wouldn't say no to Jamie Dornan as well.

Who are your dream dinner party guests?

Ricky Gervais, Anthony Joshua and Olly Murs.

If money was no object, what would be your ideal first date?

I would take him to Alcatraz, I love stuff like that. I'd take him to San Francisco and to the world's most famous jail. I think it would be quite interesting, it would give us something to talk about!

Ron Hall, 25

Essex lad Ron promises to bring ""fun and charisma"" to the villa as he said: ""I just want to be naturally myself in there, have good times and make memories. I think people will enjoy my company.""

Why Love Island and why now?

I think it's the best show to find love on. I'm now 25 and I had in my head that I'd be with someone, settled and married by say 27""¦ it's now coming awfully close to that. It's now a good opportunity for me to force myself into that intense environment. I don't use dating apps and texting, it's forced. Being in there, chatting to someone 24/7 that suits me and my personality

What do you think you'll bring to the Villa?

""Fun and charisma. I just want to be naturally myself in there, have good times and make memories. I think people will enjoy my company.""

What's your ""˜elevator pitch' for why someone should want to date you?

I'm the most genuine person you'll meet. I'm genuine, caring and I'm a nice person - which you don't find these days.

Why would you say you're single?

I'm career focussed and wanted to enjoy myself and do all the things I wanted to do. I now feel that I'm emotionally ready to say, ""˜I'm now ready to find someone.'

How would friends/family describe you?

My mum and dad would say that I am a very funny, charismatic but genuine person. I know that's a typical thing a parent would say about their son. But they know that I've got good morals. They know I'm a good person at heart. I'm not rude, I'm polite, I was brought up properly, a well-raised person. My friends would say it's very noticeable when I'm not around. I'm a good person to be around and I always ""˜add'. I'm added value.

What gives you the ""˜ick'?

Patchy fake tan.

Do you fall in love quickly?

With the right person, I'm so quick, like lightning speed.

Tell us something not many people know about you?

""On meeting me, you'd never know I am blind in one eye. It was the result of a football injury when I was 8; I went in for a header and got kicked in the face. I've got two different coloured eyes, one blue and one green. It's added to my character, there are so many people that are worse off than me. And if anything, losing something like that makes you realise that. It's not hindered me in any shape or form. It's a good conversation starter I must admit.""

What's your ""˜elevator pitch' for why someone should want to date you?

""I'm the most genuine person you'll meet. I'm genuine, caring and I'm a nice person - which you don't find these days.""

Who is your celebrity crush?

Madison Beer.

Who would you want to play you in a movie of your life?

Ben Affleck""¦ or Henry Cavill.

Who are your dream dinner party guests?

Madison Beer would be one of them; Floyd Mayweather - hopefully he'd front the bill - and someone like Morgan Freeman. I love all of his films.

If money was no object, what would be your ideal first date?

It would have to be an arcade. I could go with an abroad trip for an amazing sunset, but I just find arcades so class. They're the best first dates!

Lana Jenkins, 25

25-year-old makeup artist Lana has travelled from Luton to South Africa in a bid to find love.

What gives you the ""˜ick'?

""I don't mind people texting me all the time but if you send me question marks if I've not replied to you in a while, you're gone. That's a really big red flag for me! Also if I see a guy trip over, that's an instant turn off.""

Do you fall in love quickly?

""I fall in love quickly. I tend to know quite soon if I could fall in love with that person and then, as long as everything is going well, I'll probably tell them I love them in about a week.""

What's your claim to fame?

""In my work as a makeup artist I've worked with lots of celebrities. Also, when I was 6-years-old I used to live in Spain and I was in an episode of Benidorm as an extra.""

Why Love Island and why now?

I've been single for quite a while, I'm normally a relationship type of person so the fact that I've been single for two, almost three, years is quite rare for me. Now's the right time for me to be doing something a bit different. I've not been able to find anyone who suits me so it's good to do something totally different and try to meet someone a different way.

What do you think you'll bring to the Villa?

I think I will bring a lot of flirtation, I'm funny and I think I'm just a good person - so I will probably get on with everyone. I'll just go in there, have a laugh and have a really good time. If I'm lucky, and there is someone I get along with, I think it could be really special. I'm looking for something that's a bit deeper, something more serious that could turn into something long term and hopefully a little love story.

What's your ""˜elevator pitch' for why someone should want to date you?

I'm amazing in a relationship! I'm a good cook, good at tickles, I'm fun to be around - but also very relaxed and laid back.

Why would you say you're single?

Because I've been through relationships that have made me want to find someone perfect, I've been with people that haven't been meant for me. Since then I've been really picky about who I go for and who I let into my life.

How would friends/family describe you?

They would say that I'm funny.

Best / worst date story?

My worst date was my most recent one, he was absolutely drop dead gorgeous, 10/10 and my perfect type - so I was really excited to meet him. When I arrived he literally took me to a bar next door to his flat and hadn't made much effort - he had literally popped downstairs! All he did was talk about himself and his work. I just sat there and then he took a phone call for 20 minutes whilst I sat in front of him. He didn't even apologise! I then said, ""˜Oh I'm going to have to go' and then he went, ""˜See ya later'.

Tell us something not many people know about you?

I'm fluent in Spanish.

Who would you want to play you in a movie of your life?

Margot Robbie, I love her, she's beautiful and comes across as such a lovely person.

Do you have any unusual skills?

I can cook a mean paella.

Music is a big part of Love Island - who do you have on repeat and why?

I'm loving Little Simz at the moment, but I am also a big Bob Marley fan.

Who are your dream dinner party guests?

Louis Theroux, Bob Marley and my Great Nana.

If money was no object, what would be your ideal first date?

Barbados to swim with the pigs in the sea.

Kai Fagan, 24

24-year-old science and PE teacher from Manchester Kai was the first male Islander to be confirmed as part of the lineup for the new series.

However, finding a match might prove tricky as Kai revealed he is ""single by choice"" as he has ""high expectations"" when it comes to love.

Why Love Island and why now?

When you first meet someone you never normally get to spend that much time with them, so when you're genuinely looking for a connection, the Villa is the perfect place to do it.

What do you think you'll bring to the Villa?

I'm pretty lighthearted, I love a laugh. I'm really calm and chilled as well, pretty level headed, quite mature""¦ but not too mature.

What's your ""˜elevator pitch' for why someone should want to date you?

I'm caring, loving and impulsive so I'm always fun to be around. I'm always busy, I'm never sitting still. If you like to be busy too, then you can be busy with me. I can't remember the last time I sat in on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night.

Why would you say you're single?

The skies of the UK will be lit up by a Snow Moon tonight; the February full moon will be visible for another two days and will appear alongside Venus and a bright star

Stargazers will be able to catch a glimpse of a Snow Moon over the UK sky tonight.

The phenomenon takes place every February and is the second full moon of the year.

If you're not able to spot it tonight then you can still be in with another chance as the moon is expected to appear full for the next two days and will be visible from the UK each evening until Tuesday.

It's not the only object to look out for in the night sky at the moment, a bright star named Regulus will make an appearance near the moon and Venus will also be visible until it sets at 12.24pm

According to NASA, the Maine Farmers' Almanac began publishing Native American names for full Moons in the 1930s and they've since become widely used.

Explaining where the name for February's full moon derives from, the space agency explained: ""The tribes of what is now the northeastern United States called this the Snow Moon or the Storm Moon because of the heavy snows that fall in this season.""

It added: ""Bad weather and heavy snowstorms made hunting difficult, so this Moon was also called the Hunger Moon.""

Meanwhile, in Europe the Snow Moon is also known as the Wolf Moon or the Candles Moon.

To be in with the best chance of catching a glimpse of the stunning Snow Moon, there are a few tips you can follow.

Firstly, you should try to get to higher ground as this gives you a better chance of seeing clear skies and a clear path to the horizon.

The moon rises in the east and sets in the west so you should also make sure to be looking in the right direction.

If you're viewing the moon from your home then you should turn down the lights to get the best view as artificial light can dull the night sky.

A free app called Star Chart can also help you to spot the Snow Moon as well as the celestial objects around it.

It allows you to point your camera at the night sky and will tell you what you're looking at.

For those who still aren't able to see the Snow Moon, you can watch a free online livestream by the Virtual Telescope Project which is available on their website or YouTube channel.

A woman managed to film a rare moment that shows a spider egg sac hatched

This terrifying footage shows the moment a huge spider sac hatched on a wall while a brave farmer tried to move the mother with a plastic cup.

Jessica Street, a farm owner, was in her kitchen when she saw a large wolf spider on the wall and while attempting to remove the arachnid, she accidentally caused a huge sac of eggs to hatch. The spider, stuck between a wall and a hard place, became so stressed that their batch of baby spiders erupted inside the small container.

""ŒArmed with just a cup and a small piece of cardboard, the composed farmer was able to safely move the spiders into her backyard, with minimal escapees. While Jessica, from Groveland, Florida, seemed brave, she was still fearful of the eight-legged invaders' as she said: ""I wasn't calm before this was all contained! But honestly, I'm calm because my wife moved in a week ago and I don't want her to change her mind!""

For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US

One TikTok user said: ""If I saw that spider, I would have made it to the other side of the world in just the blink of an eye. Another commenter said: ""Hope you have homeowners' insurance. Torch and run!""

Wolf spiders don't pose a threat to humans. A few people may be allergic to their bites, but they aren't venomous. They are quite large, so their bites hurt - but generally, it's a well-behaved garden spider. They chase down and pounce on their prey. Wilf spiders eat crickets, ants, earwigs, grasshoppers, and flies.

Female wolf spiders, like the one in the video, carry their round egg-sacs underneath the back end of their bodies, attached to the organs that produce silk, called the 'spinnerets.' Females will carry the young on their back for a few days after they hatch, which is likely what happened here. When the spider got stressed or spooked, the young swarmed in an attempt to escape.

They prefer living out in the garden, which is exactly where this farmer put this mom and her babies, but they do occasionally get lost and end up in your house. It's usually not a big deal, as they'll likely leave on their own looking for food. But if you're worried, you can try spreading some strong-smelling essential oils around the walls of your home. Mint, cedar, cinnamon, and tea tree are all excellent choices and help to keep other pests at bay as well.

The little swine was born on a ranch owned by a pig farmer, Mariolys Herrera, in Guantanamo Province, Cuba, at dawn on April 18 - in an ultra rare case

A mutant pig has been born without its trademark snout.

The piglet's nostrils are located on top of its gums inside its mouth.

As a result, the tiny porker has to breathe through it instead.

The little swine was born on a ranch owned by a pig farmer, Mariolys Herrera, in Guantanamo Province, Cuba, at dawn on 18 April.

One local commented: ""I don't think he will survive that long, just amazing.""

Azucena said: ""Poor little guy. I hope he survives.""

Mariyanis wrote: ""Quite a rare case, what a shame!""

Venus remarked: ""Poor thing, I imagine it will be difficult for him to breastfeed, eat, etc.""

Mirelys commented: ""Poor thing, they don't last long because they compromise his airway when eating...""

It is unclear if the farmer has taken the pig to a vet to find out whether it has a long-term chance of survival given its compromised airways.

Earlier this year, a farmer in C rdoba Province, Argentina, was left in shock after a mutant piglet was born with two snouts.

Ram n Aguilar said the piglet was able to breathe normally despite having two snouts, two mouths, two tongues, and four nostrils.

He told local media: ""I've been raising pigs for many years and this is the first time I've seen one born like this.""

A man captured the moment a flock of sheep left to graze outside by a farmer lined up outside a bus stop. Alan Day, 63, photographed the sheep lining up behind a local bus stop in Bream, Lydney

One man in the South West thought grazing sheep looked like they were queuing for the next bus to Gloucester.

Alan Day, 63, had to look twice when he saw around 50 sheep from a nearby farm lining up behind a local bus stop in Bream, Lydney.

He said: ""When I got into the village I saw about 50 sheep.

""In a few minutes they had spread along the grass, so when the bus came, it looked like they were all queueing to board.

""I just thought it looked funny - like they wanted to take advantage of the capped £2 single fare to Gloucester.""

Farmers often use 'pannage' in some areas, which allows their flock to graze freely outside the confines of the farm.

Alan, now retired, was on his way to volunteer at Bream Community Library when he spotted the flock.

Plenty of odd sheep behaviour has been observed recently, including when a sheep and duck became best friends at Farmer Palmer's Farm Park near Poole, Dorset.

Larry the lamb and Del the duck have become inseparable after the lonely sheep was never truly accepted by his flock.

Farmworkers became worried when Larry started to become increasingly distant and thought it a good idea to pair him with Del, an abandoned duck brought to the farm after being abandoned.

Katy Lester, animal manager at the farm, said the pair are now ""inseparable.""

She said: ""It was so heartwarming seeing them grow together and they are completely inseparable now.

""We were worried that Larry had some hearing issue that meant he was never properly accepted as a member of the flock.

""When Del was brought in limping and abandoned we thought that they would be the perfect pair.

""Now they chatter away to each other and groom each other on evenings, it's just lovely to see.

More strange sheep shenanigans occurred in Mongolia when a flock was seen marching in a circle for around 10 days.

The footage was taken in the city of Baotou in Mongolia on November 4 last year.



Ms Miao, the reported owner of the sheep, is said to have had no idea why her sheep started going round in circles.

Some put the strange and low-quality video down to a disease known as listeriosis. This can cause circling when the infectious bacterial disease affects one side of the brain.

Others have said the footage of the animals shows them looking far too orderly for it to be caused by brain disease and instead suggested it was a hoax.

The price of eggs has risen by an eye-watering 85 percent in a year, and fears are also mounting over a milk shortage as the prices paid to farmers continues to fall even further

Egg prices have rocketed by 85% as fears mount over potential milk shortages.

Some eggs cost almost twice as much as they did a year ago.

And it was warned milk may vanish from the shelves if prices paid to farmers fall further.

The Grocer magazine said a third of eggs in the biggest nine supermarkets leapt in price in the past month.

The largest hike was a six-pack of free-range eggs at Asda, up 18% to £1.95, making it 30% dearer than at the start of 2022.

Iceland's 15 Mixed Sized Eggs, which rose 5.7% to £1.85, are up to 85% dearer than a year ago.

In November, prices rose by up to 20% as farmers cut output due to production costs and low profits.

The British Egg Industry Council said: ""Demand for eggs is strong during Christmas, which has put added pressure on the supply chain when availability is already tight.""

Some stores want to cut the price they pay for milk but farmers could be forced to slash output.

John Allen, from dairy consultancy firm Kite, warned of potential milk shortages later this year.

He said: ""We have never seen the gap between the cost of production and commodity levels as large as they are now.""

Donia Youssef, 45, shared videos on Facebook at her parent's farm in Rotherfield, East Sussex showing the roof ablaze - it comes as a hosepipe ban is set to come in on June 26

This is the moment a fire engulfing a farm cannot be put out because of the lack of water amid soaring temperatures.

Donia Youssef, 45, shared videos on Facebook at her parent's farm in Rotherfield, East Sussex showing the roof ablaze.

It comes as South East Water has announced a hosepipe ban to come into force for Kent and Sussex from June 26.

Bosses say it's because of the record demand for drinking water.

Areas of the region have been left with little or no water this week amid the hot weather, forcing schools to shut down and residents to get drinking water from bottled water stations.

A plea to use only essential water has stretched from Haywards Heath in West Sussex to Whitstable in Kent.

On Facebook, Donia wrote: ""Over the last 5 days, my parents have been battling the summer heat with no water while tending to our farm animals.

""Last night the challenge escalated when our family home caught fire, creating a scene ironically void of water to extinguish it.

""Thanks to the firefighter's swift actions, the fire was quelled and all is safe now. But the pressing need for the water supply to be restored is more critical than ever.

""I urge the water company South East Water to act swiftly - our farming community depends on it. Here's to my parents' resilience and the support rural areas desperately need.""

An East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service spokeswoman said: ""We were called at 7.58pm to Rotherfield to reports of a fire.

""Crews from Crowborough, Heathfield and Uckfield used one hose reel jet to extinguish the fire. No casualties were reported.""

The service added that its engines can ""carry a great deal of water"" and that its crews had ""increased the number of appliances turning out to fires in the areas that are currently without water, providing an extra tank of water to any incident"".

Tanya Sephton, Customer Services Director for South East Water, said: ""We are sorry to hear of the fire at a farm in Rotherfield. We're pleased the fire service was able to deal with it and that there were no casualties.

""We are working with the Local Resilience Forum, which includes Sussex Fire and Rescue, to make sure the fire service is fully kept up to date with the situation enabling them to make contingency plans were necessary.

""We are sorry to customers currently without water and we are working hard to replenish our network and restore supplies.""

It comes as a farmer with 40 cattle and heifers about to give birth is ""hysterical"" due to the water shortages in an East Sussex area, a councillor has said.

Wealden District councillor Michael Lunn expressed anger at the ""crazy situation"" in the rural area hit by the lack of water and had spoken to around 20 farmers affected by the drop in supply from South East Water.

Mr Lunn also described how another farm owner with 20 horses also has no water provision.

""It's really serious,"" he said, adding: ""As far as I'm concerned, they (South East Water) are just so, so slow in responding to this crisis.

""We were aware this was going to happen... we are not shocked or surprised, we are disappointed and we are really angry.""

Mr Lunn, a farmer himself, also rejected South East Water ""in effect blaming residents"" over their water usage but instead believes the water company is underinvesting in its infrastructure.

He added that in communications with South East Water, the crisis will not be resolved until ""at least Sunday"".

South East Water said despite providing an extra 120 million litres of water a day, demand in June has broken records, including from the Covid lockdown heatwave.

David Hinton, the firm's chief executive, said: ""This situation has developed much more rapidly than last year. Understandably, we've seen customer demand increase in line with the hotter weather, however, this has impacted our ability to keep all customers in supply at all times.

""Despite asking for customers' help to use water for essential uses only, regrettably we've now been left with no choice but to introduce this temporary use ban restriction to protect customers' supplies across Kent and Sussex.""

Mr Hinton said the long-term forecast for the summer is a dry period with little rainfall, adding: ""Restricting the use of hosepipes and sprinklers to make sure we have enough water for our customers' essential use will ensure we can serve our vulnerable customers and to protect the local environment.""

On Friday, three schools in East Sussex partially closed due to water shortages.

Mark Cross Church of England Primary School in Crowborough said it could not open to all-year groups because of reduced sanitary facilities and no running water.

Wealden MP Nusrat Ghani has been calling on South East Water to introduce a hosepipe ban since earlier this week, blasting the company for ""appalling"" outages across her East Sussex constituency.

""Today is day six of misery and we're still counting. It's always too hot or too cold for @sewateruk to cope with demand in Wealden. We have been here before and lessons are never learnt,"" she tweeted on Friday before the hosepipe ban was announced.

Southern Water which supplies areas of Kent also issued a warning on Thursday that demand for water in the county was ""outstripping supply"" as the spell of hot and dry weather continues.

On Friday the firm said customers in Fairlight and Hastings were experiencing low or no water pressure and it had set up a bottled water station.

The provider said demand is 15 per cent higher than expected for this time of year, and that this week has been the highest level of use by Kent homes and businesses since last summer's heatwave.

TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson was refused planning permission by West Oxfordshire District Council last year to extend a car park at his farm in Oxfordshire - and tensions have reached boiling point as locals clash at a hearing meeting for the refused plans

Jeremy Clarkson's Diddly Squat farm has been branded a ""menace"" and a ""danger"" by angry locals.

Villagers have once again clashed with the former Top Gear presenter at a planning meeting amid his attempts to extend the car park at his farm shop.

A hearing was held this week relating to Clarkson's appeal against the refusal by the council to grant planning permission for the extension with locals turning up to voice their views about the impact of the business on the Oxfordshire countryside.

Angry locals clashed at the meeting with villager Hilary Moore claiming the tourists who visited the farm - which sits between Chadlington and Chipping Norton - came to ""show off their cars"" and block roads.

The Chadlington resident told the meeting: ""I don't think the people who come are particularly respectful.

""They come in their cars with their souped-up engines - they are motorheads, they are not here to support our little farm shop.

""We have been disrupted by them in the two-and-a-half years since it's been open. It's ruining our area.

""There are farm shops all over the country that they could support instead of all converging here at the weekends.

""It's a total menace. It's a danger.""

Meanwhile Joanna Cecil, a florist at the farm ""since the very beginning"", came to its defence.

Ms Cecil told the meeting the farm attracted visitors who wanted to support local farming.

""People go to the shop because it sells local,"" she said.

""This is what Jeremy loves: he invests in the farm, he invests in local people.

""He is making a success of it for local people, for our children, and for our future.""

The hearing comes as Jeremy is appealing against West Oxfordshire District Council's decision to deny him an extension to his car park despite the council's own tourism manager previously saying it would help improve safety and prevent problems.

He is also challenging the council's move to shut down his restaurant on the same plot of land because he allegedly did not have planning permission when he opened it in July last year.

The council shut it down in August saying that the ""nature, scale and siting"" of the restaurant on his farm was ""incompatible with its open countryside location"" in the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in its enforcement notice at the time.

They ordered Jeremy to close the eatery along with anything selling food that would be consumed on the farm, and remove the picnic tables, chairs, dining tables, parasols and mobile toilets from the site.

Clarkson's planning representatives have appealed the decisions, saying he is not in breach of planning laws and claiming that the council's decision is ""excessive"".

In their appeal against the enforcement notice, Jeremy's representatives at John Phillips Planning Consultancy wrote that existing planning permission gives the right to use the farm as a restaurant, and there has been no ""material change"" to the land.

But the council's lawyers have disagreed, saying the ""level of use of the site"" has ""significantly increased"" due to the restaurant. They added that the land was ""now used for a mix of purposes which go well beyond that of a farm shop"".

Council planners have said that these reasons mean that the current planning permission ""could never apply"" to the new enterprises on the site.

The Who Wants To Be A Millionaire host is expecting a final decision on the planning appeal in the coming weeks.

Meanwhile, tensions reached boiling point this week as the local council revealed that death threats had been made against two people who opposed Jeremy's Diddly Squat farm expansions.

West Oxfordshire District Council told on Monday that it is aware of malicious communications against an unnamed councillor and a member of the public who spoke out against the 62-year-old's expansion.

The threats came after Season 2 of Clarkson's Farm via Amazon Studios aired on February 10, the council said.

It said they put extra security measures in place for Tuesday's hearing as a result of the threats.

And on Wednesday it was revealed that Clarkson's 16-year-old farm workers are wearing body cameras after receiving abuse from villagers.

Brits could experience a shortage of Ferrero Rocher chocolates this year due to a lower availability of hazelnuts in Turkey - and there are fears prices could go up

A hazelnut supply crisis caused by a lack of rain and insect problems could threaten the availability of a Christmas favourite this year, experts of the sector have warned.

Around 70 per cent of hazelnuts are grown in Turkey, but this year the crop in the country is lower than usual. There are now fears that Ferrero, which makes the Christmas favourite Ferrero Rocher, as well as Nutella, could face issues in the production of the foil-wrapped festive chocolate treat.

According to marketing experts, the supply crisis could mean that this year there will be fewer boxes of Ferrero Rocher on the shelves, or that the chocolate treats will see an increase in price. Currently, the cost of hazelnuts has already soared by more than 40% in the eight weeks of September 27 - and is now $780/100kg (£637/100kg), Mintec data shows.

Mintec senior analyst Jara Zicha said: ""The price increase is indeed driven by shorter than expected production in Turkey. The initial estimates from May/June this year came in at 720,000 to 810,000 tonnes. When the harvest started, farmers started reported much lower output, which has caused prices in Turkey to surge.""

Kenan Ä°ncirkuÅŸ, a trader from Giresun, Turkey, said there are ""very few hazelnuts"" this year, as he added: ""We went to speak to farmers, and they all said the harvest would be much smaller than last year. We are seeing the effects of global warming, insect damage and, in particular, a lack of rainfall during the critical nut development period in May.""

Swaroop Joshi, sales and marketing VP at hazelnut supplier Ofi, added that while supplies are low, it is believed the current availability of hazelnuts is ""adequate to meet existing demand"". But it is believed the shrinking demand could become a problem for companies like Ferrero, which are big hazelnut buyers, reports The Grocer.

The price of Nutella, which sources most of its hazelnuts from Turkey, has already gone up as its other key ingredients - sugar and cocoa - have also seen significant global price hikes. Mr Zicha said that if higher prices were to stay, some companies may try to substitute hazelnuts with nut mixes.

Last year, Brits were warned that there might be a shortage of turkeys at Christmas as half of free-range brits had either died or had been culled due to bird flu. Poultry farmers said a ""big, big shortage"" could mean many families would miss out on the Christmas dinner favourite as whole flocks were wiped out in the worst-ever outbreak.

At a Commons hearing, British Poultry Council chief executive Richard Griffiths said the problem was ""huge"". ""This year is the worst bird flu outbreak that we've seen,"" he told MPs. ""Around 1.6million birds have been culled because of bird flu on farms.

""So it's huge and the ongoing costs for industry and food production are potentially enormous."" Mr Griffiths said around 36% of poultry farms faced restrictions linked to bird flu.

Paul Kelly, who runs Kelly Turkeys in Colchester, Essex, said the spread of the outbreak was""devastating"". The poultry farmer, who is nicknamed the ""King of Turkeys"", warned: ""There will be a big, big shortage of British free-range turkeys on the shelves this year."" He added: ""We have one farm with 9,500 [turkeys]. The first infection was on Thursday evening and by Monday lunchtime they were all dead.""

Dianne Bourne did her 'big shop' at her local farm shop to see how it compared to the supermarkets - and while the price of bread was jaw-dropping, she'd shop there again

Farm shops are a great way to support small businesses by buying jams, chutneys, cheese, and meat that have all been sourced in your local area.

And while we all love having a wander around the quaint shops to pick up the odd loaf of artisan bread, they do have a reputation for being rather pricey - and certainly not somewhere you'd do a full weekly shop unless you had money to spare.

But with the price of a big shop already sky-high for many families, is a ""posh"" farm shop really that much more expensive than a trip to a regular supermarket?

The Lambing Shed in Knutsford, Cheshire, recently posted a price comparison on social media that claimed their prices aren't much different to the supermarkets and said those that are ""a few pennies more"" help to support the local farmers that stock the shop.

So can you do a big shop in a ""posh"" farm shop? Manchester Evening News reporter Dianne Bourne headed down to the award-winning Lambing Shed to find out.

Dianne has to feed two adults and two children with her big shop, and when she first entered The Lambing Shed, she admitted she ""nearly fell over"" when confronted with the price of a punnet of strawberries - which came in at a staggering £4.75.

And the writer was also floored by the price of bread, as she said: ""The cheapest sliced loaf of bread when I visited on a Saturday afternoon was a granary tin priced at £3.85.""

However, as Dianne moved on to look at the meat selection, she admitted the prices come down considerably when you take advantage of their deals - as she bagged 500g of minced beef and a pack of giant sausages for the 2 for £8 deal.

She explained: ""I also asked for a couple of the pork steaks from the meat counter, fearing how much it would come up at. But £5.04 seemed pretty OK to me given they were huge chunks that I planned to make into a big stew for the family.

""The cheapest whole chicken I could find on the shelf was priced at £7.78, but it was a lot larger than the small ones I usually go for which tend to cost me around £3.50 - £4 at the supermarket. I did end up making two meals out of it over two days.""

Dianne then made her way over to the pasta to pick up some fusilli to go with her mince and was flabbergasted to find the artisan Lancashire brand, Northern Pasta Co, priced at a staggering £4.95.

She noted that while there was another 2 for £8 offer on the pasta, she didn't pick up a second bag.

And in the world of fruit and veg, prices were fairly reasonable, with the few hand-washed carrots Dianne bought coming in at 37p, some leeks at £1.54, and a 2kg bag of potatoes at £1.89.

The writer also bought a bottle of semi-skimmed milk for £1.35, some flapjacks for £3.95, and a tub of Mobberley ice cream for an eye-watering £6.50 - which she described as a ""taste sensation"".

But one of the biggest shocks Dianne received was when she dashed back to the deli counter to pick up some cheddar that she'd forgotten to add to her shop.

She said: ""At the last minute I realised I hadn't picked up any cheese and so I dashed back to the deli counter to ask for the 'smallest piece of cheddar'. I was in a rush at this point so I only saw when I got to the counter that the 296g of Wookey Hole cheddar came in at an eye-watering £6.81.

""Now I appreciate it's a 'posher' cheddar than I would get at the supermarket - but that price is simply something I would never pay at a supermarket for my cheese.""

In total, Dianne spent £97.03 on her shop at The Lambing Shed, and said that while that is a lot of money, her big shops at the likes of Sainsbury's, Waitrose and Morrisons have all been coming in at over £100 in recent months.

So how did the prices compare to the supermarkets?

When The Lambing Shed claimed their prices weren't much different to the big chains, they compared their items to those stocked by Waitrose - which is arguably one of the pricier supermarkets out there.

And while some items, such as potatoes, bacon, yoghurt, and orange juice were cheaper at the farm shop than Dianne's local Waitrose, the staggering prices of pasta, cheese, strawberries, and bread meant that the farm shop was more than £20 more expensive than the same shop at Waitrose.

Dianne said that while her Lambing Shed shop came to £97.03, an equivalent shop at Waitrose would have been £76.72.

In her final verdict, she said: ""Some items I just couldn't justify on my family budget for that sort of expense again - like the pasta at £4.75 and the cheese at £6.81. But the overall experience at the farm shop was obviously much more pleasant than rushing around in a crammed supermarket.

""As the Lambing Shed said in its Instagram post, spending extra pennies here does help to support small local businesses, which made me feel a bit warm and fuzzy about my big shop. Which is something I can honestly say I've never felt after trudging out of a traditional supermarket.""

Faba beans, typically fed to animals, are believed to offer humans more enhanced nutritional benefits than soya beans

Beans ""in"" toast could revolutionise the British diet.

A new project has been set up to slip more UK-grown beans into our daily bread.

The 'Raising the Pulse' project plans to encourage consumers and food producers to switch to bread that contains broad beans to make it healthier and less damaging to the environment.

Unlike imported soya beans currently used in bread, broad beans, also known as fava or faba beans, grow in the UK.

They are high in easily digested protein, fibre, and iron, which are all nutrients that can be low in our diets.

However, despite it being an excellent alternative, the majority of faba beans grown in the UK are currently given to animals.

Five teams of researchers at the University of Reading, along with members of the public, farmers, industry, and policy makers, are working together to bring about one of the biggest changes to UK food in generations.

They hope to encourage farmers to switch some wheat producing land to grow faba beans for human consumption.

Professor Julie Lovegrove, who is leading the ""˜Raising the Pulse' research programme, said: ""We had to think laterally, ""˜What do most people eat and how can we improve their nutrition without them having to change their diets?' The obvious answer is bread.

""96 per cent of people in the UK eat bread, and 90 per cent of that is white bread, which in most cases contains soya.

""We've already performed some experiments and found that faba bean flour can directly replace imported soya flour and some of the wheat flour, which is low in nutrients.

""We can not only grow the faba beans here, but also produce and test the faba bean-rich bread, with improved nutritional quality.""

Matt Tebbit, who runs the University's catering service and leads the University's ""˜Menus for Change' research programme, said: ""Students will be asked to rate products made or enriched with faba bean, such as bread, flat bread, and hummus.

""They will be asked questions about how full they felt, for how long and their liking of the foods.

""It is hoped that faba bean will improve satiety, as well as providing enhanced nutritional benefits in products that are enjoyable to eat.""

The ""˜Raising the Pulse' project is estimated to cost £2 million and run over three years.

The project began on the 18 January and was published in the journal Nutrition Bulletin.

Kelvin Fletchers' family farm is offering visitors a chance to meet Father Christmas and experience a magical Christmas at the Peak District farm this December

Former Emmerdale star Kelvin Fletcher has been criticised by parents for the 'ridiculous' cost of visiting Santa at his Peak District farm.

The 39-year-old and his wife Liz have opened a festive Santa's Village, but families are unhappy with the ticket prices. The experience, which includes making reindeer food and meeting Father Christmas, costs between £48 to £54 for children and £24 to £28 for adults.

Despite the high prices, celebrity friends of the soap actor, including ex-Corrie star Shayne Ward, were among the first visitors. Irritated fans have been sharing their thoughts on social media about the pricing. Some even suggested that it's only for 'upper-class Tories' and celebrities.

One person commented: ""It's far too dear for families, needs to be half the price,"" while another said: ""I love the programme but must agree that three adults and two children was too expensive for us too. Such a shame. I do hope it's a success though."" One shared their opinion and posted: ""I love watching the family but it's a bit too expensive for me. Good luck to you both.""

Meanwhile, another fan said: ""I love the family but the price for a family is £140. It's a bit too expensive. But I still like to watch them on TV for their genuine down-to-earth farming."" The Fletchers' Farm is currently being featured on a Sunday morning ITV documentary. The show explores how first-time farmers Kelvin and Liz are adjusting to their new life after moving to the farm in 2022 with their four young children.

Their efforts to create a Santa's Village will be showcased in a new ITV special set to air on Christmas Eve.

Kelvin shared: ""Liz and I are excited to welcome everyone to the farm this December. As a family, we've put our all into making this experience as magical as we can and we hope visitors have the best time. Not only is it a bit of festive fun, but it's also a chance to come and see a working farm, something some kids may never have done.""

Liz chimed in: ""Santa's Village has been so much fun to put together. If families have half as much fun as we did setting it up when they visit, it's going to be a blast! The kids have been amazing. Santa has his little helpers; we definitely have our own too.""

Kelvin, who hails from Oldham, swapped city life for the countryside after winning Strictly Come Dancing in 2019 with dance partner Oti Mabuse. The couple's 120-acre farm isn't usually open to the public, but they wanted to host special Christmas events. This allows folks to book visits on selected dates in December.

Channel 5 star Amanda Owen has made herself an impressive fortune following her split from her ex-husband Clive

Our Yorkshire Farm's Amanda Owen has doubled her earnings to an impressive six figure salary following her split from Clive Owen.

New data filed on 31st December for 2021 proves that the Channel 5 star's business is now worth 343,924 - an increase of £177,995 from the year before, according to MailOnline.

Amanda's company, Yorkshire Shepherdess LTD is now worth £423,639 in assets, according to accounts seen by the publication.

The 48-year-old has seen a lofty surge in her earnings in comparison to 2019 - when the second season of the show first aired to viewers, and figures were held at £39,000.

Amanda first rose to fame alongside her now ex-husband Clive, 68, in 2011 on the ITV series The Dales, before they landed their own spot on Channel 5 in Our Yorkshire Farm in 2018.

But in June this year, following months of rumours surrounding their relationship status, the pair released a joint statement confirming that they had made ""˜the difficult decision to separate'.

Earlier this year she wrote: ""Clive and I have are sad to confirm that we have made the difficult decision to separate.

""This hasn't been easy, but we both believe it's the right choice for the future of our family.""

The statement continued: ""Although we are no longer a couple, we continue to work on the farm and co-parent together with our number one priority the happiness and well-being of our children.""

Amanda and Clive met in 1995 after she took up a job at his farm as a 21-year-old trainee shepherdess.

Clive was divorced with two children at the time, but the pair soon tied the knot and went on to have nine children together - Annas, Violet, Edith, Raven, Clemmy, Nancy, Reuben, Miles, and Sidney.

Viewers had a soft spot for the pair and their unconventional love story, with some viewers calling Amanda and Clive the ""˜Kardashians of the Countryside' after watching the hit series.

Shepherd Amanda has also paved her way on various popular TV shows, having become a regular guest on series like Lorraine and This Morning to offer her thoughts on parenting and what her life is like on the farm.

The factual boss of the series, Daniel Pearl, told us in an exclusive interview that Amanda might be making some future appearances on-screen.

""The Owens have become everyone's favourite farming family and millions have enjoyed watching their unique way of life. It's fantastic that we can now all follow Reuben and Clive on their next adventure.

""We remain absolutely committed to the whole wonderful Owen family and hope to announce new projects with Amanda very soon.""

Elephants, dolphins, tiger cubs and other animals endure horrendous treatment, forced to perform unnatural tricks for spectators

It's 30 years since the last dolphinarium in Britain was closed, ending the unspeakable cruelty of keeping such intelligent creatures in confinement.

Many other important animal welfare advances have followed, most recently last year's Animal Sentience Act which enshrined the welfare of animals in UK law. And I was privileged to play a small part in introducing Lucy's Law to end the horrors of battery puppy farming in Britain.

But while advances are being made here, we could unwittingly be contributing to horrendous animal suffering abroad.

I should declare an interest - I'm a patron of the charity Save the Asian Elephants and one of its main aims is to ban travel firms from selling trips to venues that abuse these magnificent creatures.

They are not the only ones suffering, as Parliament heard this week.

Long-standing animal welfare campaigner Henry Smith is the Conservative MP for Crawley in Sussex and vice chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare.

""Every year, hundreds of thousands of wild animals are exploited for entertainment in the global tourism industry,"" he told a debate on Tuesday in support of the Animals (Low-Welfare Activities Abroad) Bill.

""Examples include tiger cubs made to pose for selfies, elephant rides and swim-with-dolphin experiences, as well as captive dolphin shows.

""Behind every elephant ride is an abused elephant, and behind every swim-with-dolphin experience there is appalling cruelty.""

He called for action to help end ""this miserable abuse"" with new legislation making it illegal to promote holidays which include exploitative animal encounters.

""Although we cannot enforce our laws in other countries, we can prevent British tourists from buying - often unintentionally - cruel animal experiences abroad from companies operating in the UK.""

He described tanks used to keep dolphins at tourist ""attractions"" as typically 200,000 times smaller than their natural home range.

""Tanks are often barren to allow visitors a better view, which results in little mental stimulation for the animals and nowhere for them to hide.

""No captive facility can ever meet the complex needs of these highly intelligent animals.""

The same issue afflicts Asian elephants which range between 30 and 600 square kilometres in the wild, something no captive tourist site can come close to replicating.

The debate came on the same day that Save The Asian Elephants presented a petition to 10 Downing Street with 1.2 million signatures calling for a ban on the advertising and sale of trips to unethical tourist venues.

""A new law will, if properly crafted and implemented, steer the market from rank exploitation and brutality to an ethical and safe model where Asian venues show elephants in natural surroundings,"" said Duncan McNair, the charity's chief executive.

""Polls independently commissioned by Save the Asian Elephants show public support in UK for such law running at between 85% and 99%.""

One of the most notorious venues is Nongnooch in Thailand, where elephants are made to perform tricks for spectators and kept in control by mahouts with metal bullhooks. In 2000 British tourist Andrea Costigan was killed by an elephant that ran amok, driven mad by its torment.

""Nong Nooch, which I visited two months ago, is worse now than in 2000, yet today it is advertised by 120 UK based travel companies,"" said Mr McNair.

Also presenting the petition were Labour front bencher Barry Gardiner, former Conservative minister Anne Widdecombe, and long-standing animal welfare campaigners Peter Egan of Downton Abbey and Afterlife fame, and Stanley Johnson, father of Boris.

Amazon's Clarkson's Farm star Kaleb Cooper posted a sweet video as he and his fiancÃ©e Taya discovered they were expecting a baby girl in a sweet gender reveal

Clarkson's Farm star Kaleb Cooper has shared the happy news that he and his fiancÃ©e Taya are expecting a baby girl.

The 24-year-old and his wife-to-be Taya took to social media to share a sweet gender reveal clip, where tractors were used to find out if they were having a boy or girl.

The happy couple stood in front of two tractors and counted down until pink smoke came out the exhaust of the vehicles, revealing their unborn tot was a little girl.

""Only one way to do a Gender Reveal,"" he captioned the clip.

His friends and family were with them and he admitted he was a 'bit nervous' before finding out their baby's gender.

They hugged each other as their family celebrated in the background.

Fans were loving the creative gender reveal and took to the comment section to congratulate the couple.

""Congrats to you both! Easily the best gender reveal that I've seen,"" one user said while another added: ""Fantastic gender reveal huge congratulations to you both.""

One said: ""Congratulation kaleb. All the best for your family.""

""Congratulations! That is quite brilliant,"" another follower posted.

Back in November, Kaleb shared he and his fiancÃ©e Taya are expecting a second baby together.

The couple already share a child named Oscar, who they welcomed together in March last year.

But, since embarking on his parenting journey with partner Taya, the pair are looking to expand their brood and expecting another baby in June.

Kaleb, who won the hearts of viewers as he was frequently faced with comical clashes with Clarkson on the show, told The Sun: ""I don't know if I feel nervous or excited.

""I have always wanted to be a younger dad and I have plenty of experience with kids having to put up with Jeremy every day.""

Adding a witty jab to Clarkson he added: ""Oscar is already better at farming than Jeremy I'm sure of it!""

Kaleb had many happy moments in the last few months as he proposed to Taya during the Christmas holidays.

He took to his Instagram page to share the exciting news with his 1.1 million followers.

""She said yes! 2022 has been an amazing year. This definitely tops it off,"" he captioned the happy post.

""I honestly can't wait for 2023 and all the following years after that. @tayaaaxx your my best friend as well as the love of my life.""

Kaleb added: ""Was a long wait for this (6 and a half years).""

Mum-of-nine Amanda Owen took a break from working in TV but it looks like she is set to appear in new Channel 4 show Our Farm Next Door alongside former husband Clive and son Reuben

Our Yorkshire Farm's Amanda Owen is said to be plotting her TV comeback after affair allegations emerged.

The mum-of-nine has taken a break from being on our screens but she will be back soon as it's thought she is due to appear on new Channel 4 show Our Farm Next Door. She is set to star alongside her son Reuben and husband Clive, despite recent affair rumours on Amanda's part.

Amanda feared the end of her successful TV career after it was unveiled that she allegedly had a five year relationship with a 71-year-old web designer. She and her family are taking part in the upcoming show while they renovate a farmhouse.

The programme is said to have began production in August and is due to air next year. The Sun reported that a source said: ""Amanda's ego has taken a battering. Her popularity fell off a cliff after the affair was exposed. She knows the only way for her to get back on TV ""” and for it to be successful ""” is for Clive to be involved and for them to put up a united front.""

69-year-old Clive is said to have agreed to keep working with Amanda on their farm when their 22 year marriage came to an end. It was revealed that Amanda had allegedly been having a relationship with Robert Davies.

It was reported that Mr Davies' wife, Yasumi, was heartbroken after she allegedly found a note from Amanda to Robert inside a bag in his car. It read: ""Robert, life is too short & happiness is too rare. I love you.""

She then said she confronted her husband, who has been married five times, and he confessed to the apparent affair. Yasumi said: ""Instead of acknowledging my pain, he was more concerned about protecting her TV career. I'd watched Our Yorkshire Farm and couldn't help but be impressed by her. She portrayed herself as a wife and a mother, devoted to family, and an inspiration to others. But she's been lying to the public and living a double life.""

Robert is said to still be involved with Amanda, who is a similar age to his daughter. Amanda apparently met Mr Davies when she hired him to launch a website to promote her work. Last month it was reported that he has began divorce proceedings with Yasumi.

Speaking to The Sun, a source claimed: ""Robert has begun divorce proceedings with Yasumi. She's finding it very difficult and stressful. It's been a terrible 12 months for her and it's not getting any easier. Robert has moved into a rented property and is pushing to get the legal process sorted. Yasumi suspects he wants to get the divorce done as soon as possible so that he and Amanda can be together.""

The Mirror have contacted Amanda's reps for comment.

Singer Kelis ditched the fame she had acquired from her hit tracks like Millionaire and Milkshake to go and live a quiet life on a remote farm before her ""romance"" with Bill Murray

Kelis has left the glam of Hollywood for a quiet life on a remote farm.

She reportedly ""hated living in LA"" and ditched Beverly Hills in 2020 for a 24-acre plot of land which she cultivated into a farm with her late husband Mike Mora and her three kids.

Mike sadly passed from stomach cancer aged 37 last year.

Kelis had found happiness again with Mike after leaving her troubled past with ex-partner Nas behind her. She shares her son Knight with the rapper who she has previously claimed that he was ""abusive"" towards her when she was seven months pregnant.

She told Essence that she was urged to leave Nas after seeing the pictures of Rihanna after her infamous domestic dispute with ex, Chris Brown.

""Something reminded me of Rihanna. I remember so clearly when the pictures came out when the Rihanna and Chris Brown pictures came out I thought about coming out because I also had bruises all over my body""¦I wasn't ready to walk, I just wasn't,"" Kelis said.

""Honestly, I'm not weak but I didn't say anything because I'm really private. I don't like people in my business. But seeing her the way she looked and then looking at myself""¦ I was embarrassed.

She added: ""I didn't say anything because I wanted this to work and I was delusional and I thought that I could love past this.""

Nas responded to the allegations, denying them and telling Hollywood Unlocked : ""I do not beat women. I did not beat up my ex wife. Stop.""

""Not a single person in my life loved or could even stand you. Luckily for you our assistants all signed NDA's or you would have a list of men and women who would happily talk about how verbally abusive and evil you are,"" he said at the time.

Since the end of her relationship with Nas and her new life on a farm with Mike, although short-lived, Kelis has found a haven in her private dwelling.

She's since been rumoured to be dating Billy Murray after the pair were spotted attending multiple events together and sources claimed they were ""getting close.""
