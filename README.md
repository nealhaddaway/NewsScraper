# NewsScraper

This repository houses R scripts and a Shiny app designed to support scraping of selected media outlets based on specific search terms. The tool downloads the article main text along with all article image files and captions.

Outputs are provided as: 1) a dataframe (and optional CSV export) containing unique record identifiers, article texts, image captions, and image file identifiers; 2) a report listing the site, search terms, and numbers of results; and 3) a folder containing all image files.

This tool is intended for non-commercial personal/research use, and copyright law should be followed by all users.
